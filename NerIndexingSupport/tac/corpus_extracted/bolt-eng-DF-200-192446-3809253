In an effort to address rising obesity rates and health care costs, Hungary on Thursday implemented a law imposing special taxes on foods with high fat, salt and sugar content.
The move comes as other European countries also consider policies to fight obesity.

Beginning Sept. 1, Hungarians will have to pay a 10 forint (€ 0.37) tax on foods with high fat, sugar and salt content, as well as increased tariffs on soda and alcohol.
The expected annual proceeds of €70 million will go toward state health care costs, including those associated with addressing the country's 18.8 percent obesity rate

There are also questions over the effectiveness of fat-tax legislation. The growing list of taxes on unhealthy foods is leading to a debate on whether an increase in taxes can actually translate to a decrease in obesity.

Scientific research shows that taxation is not an effective instrument in addressing consumer behavior and will have no impact on obesity rates," McCooey argued.
"Consumer information and education, not tax, is the way to advance consumer understanding of healthy eating.

The link between the price of a product and its purchase is clear and has been well substantiated," countered EPHA's Turnbull. But, he added, taxes alone cannot lead to healthier habits. "Combined with health promotion measures designed to increase awareness of the health issues associated with a poor diet, the impact of fiscal measures applied to food policy can be significant."

So see the mentioned article  here 

So Hungary are now doing it (although some experts believe it wont do much at all) although not on a full on scale. Other countries are thinking about it, the general view is that many will soon follow.

Over a quarter of British adults are now overweight. With projections being a figure closer to 40% by 2030. That would be over £2bn in spending  by the NHS  to cope.
But for many, this will never be enough; ' But for many experts this is not enough. The Lancet researchers have argued tougher action - such as legislation - is needed to tackle the issue.'

So what is your view on a UK 'Fat Tax'?, yes or no? Should we be more forcefuland put in some kind of legislation?
 
 
This is amazing!
 
 
It's not going to make any difference. Cigarettes are ludicrously expensive - doesn't stop people smoking though. Same thing here.
 
 
That means KFC would be more expensive! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
 
 
Well, when rationing in the second world war was going full force 1942-ish we were very healthy apparently. Nobody really over-ate or under-ate because of rationing.

But now, rationing isn't appropriate. We would, of course, be far better off if less people were obese, but it is quite authoritarian taxing things.

For example, taxing cigarettes is just because second hand cigarette smoke can cause damage to others. Eating fattening foods doesn't pose a direct risk to others, so it's less justifyable.

Fat foods are part of a healthy diet anyway, taxing them would essentially be a food tax - which is... awful!
 
 
Its a step in the right direction, but i agree it is not nearly enough to have any noticeable effect. Even at a higher tax rate people would still have unhealthy food readily available.

I do believe i had seen a study which showed that the effects of the cost and tax increases on cigarettes meant less people were buying them. It's quite naive to think they will ever stop because of it of course, the same with the food tax, but to say it doesn't impact people's spending habits is a bit silly. Plus the extra costs put on to tobacco products is vastly bigger than the small margin Hungary are putting on junk food xD. So this will more likely than not have no massive effect, but even a small one is a step in the right direction ;D
 
 
this fat tax should be imposed on people who are fat only

well sure, but healthy food in itself is very expensive.. The cost of fresh fruit and veg and meat is just sky high.

So we're going to have a nation of hungry people if they introduce this over here, in that case. People still won't be able to afford the healthy stuff, and they won't be able to afford unhealthy stuff either if its taxed.
 
 
I don't think it would make a difference- people would just pay the higher price.

It's a good idea though, I wonder if it will work!
 
 
Sounds fine to me, there's a negative externality of the fat.

I would put on a fat tax and a sugar tax.

Just make the unhealthy stuff more expensive than healthy stuff, then they will just have to buy healthy stuff, but in small quantities so they don't end up fat. Alternatively they could spend a load of money going to weightwatchers etc, to be told to have healthy stuff...in small quantities...

Well brings up that old point doesn't it. Is fast junk food cheaper than healthy food?

Could i buy an apple cheaper than a chocolate bar? Yep. Can i make a nice chicken meal for cheaper than processed ready meal? Yep.

People could end up spending less if they bothered, i doubt people would go hungry because of it. If they do that's just because they are too stuck in their old eating habits to change them.
 
 
I'd be ok with that here if the revenue went to subsidise prices of healthy foods.
 
 
I think it's good, but a better idea would just be to make healthy stuff i.e. fruit and veg cheaper instead. Was in tesco the other day and wowza, is fruit getting expensive! Love mangoes but they're oh so pricey.
 
 
LOL at the title...... "Hungary Introduces 'Fat Tax'"  
 
 
Sounds good. I wonder if it will be levied on high-end items like foie gras too...

Yep this is one of the points some people raised in a few articles.

but then again, that would mean they lose money, and we know they don't like doing that ;D.

A good mid point would just be both though. Equate the prices so the system doesn't give them any money :P
 
 
I think it would work....i stopped eating in mac donalds recently cos it was getting too expensive, so now i eat in gregs when i meet friends in town
although i agree it about cigarettes, fags are more of a hobby/addiction which is hard to break. less people are addicted to expensive fast food.
This does work two ways--if you increase the cost of unhealthy food then use the extra income to bring down cost of healthy--although most overweight people are overweight cos of genetics.
i eat so much more than my friends but dont put on much weight at all--its my genetics. it s a huge factor i think.
 
 
Definately yes, why should normal sized people have to pay the price for people who are unable to practice self constrant when it comes to food? Though i think it is wrong to tax for certain food types, while it means that the money can be used to pay for health care etc it will do nothing to decrease obesity levels. Instead if someone who is obese wants to see a doctor they should pay the full price for the service, with an exception made for health problems that make it hard for people to stay at a correct weight.
There wont be a discount for people on benefits either. If someone can afford to eat to excess they can afford to pay for it.
Think something similar should be introduced for smokers and binge drinkers. They way people choose to live their lives should be cost neutral on the NHS
 
 
In my opinion a change in the regulations at the UK's food standard agency which sets a rule of how much a certain piece of food needs to actually be that food would be better.

For example the minimum amount of chicken in a chicken fillet should be 80% etc. That way not only will it mean that fast food chains can't sell 'chicken' that is mostly just salted water and fattening chemicals, hence making the food healthier, but they wouldn't be able to sell foods so cheaply if they're better quality and original food.

It's shockingly horrific how some of the food sold in this country barely consists of the food itself and mostly just added substitutes and flavourings. Result: cheap but extremely fattening and unhealthy.

The same goes with certain E-number chemicals. Some of the ones that are banned in other countries (including America) are allowed here.

Denmark is a good example of how they run the food standards agency, even though they do take it to the extreme at times by banning marmite over food safety. But they have a very good standard of food and studies show how their population are healthy because of it. They also have very strict laws about where their meat can be imported from.

This fat tax won't do much to help causes.

You do realise that Gregs isn't much healthier, right?   Greasy sausage rolls or whatever will still have lots of fat and crap in them.
 
 
Use the money from this tax to subsidise healthier foods?
 
 
 
Well, when rationing in the second world war was going full force 1942-ish we were very healthy apparently. Nobody really over-ate or under-ate because of rationing.

This isn't really true, there's a massive difference between the fat found in an avocado (good fat) and the fat found in a pizza (bad fat). Presumably under the new system, the pizza would have the extra tax on it and the avocado wouldn't.

There is the argument that not every taxpayer should foot the entire bill for every case of tobacco-induced lung cancer/heart disease. Smokers pay tax on their cigarettes to offset the cost of the treatment of smoking-related illnesses (in theory at least).
It's the same argument again with fatty/salty foods; it will cost the NHS money to fix you, so you might as well start helping to pay for it whilst you're abusing your body. That way NHS will receive some extra funding to pay for obesity-related illnesses, meaning they have a larger budget for people who got sick through no fault of their own.
 
 
Fantastic idea. Even if the tax is ineffective for combatting obesity in its current form, it the very least it will raise some money for the state to spend on healthcare bills and healthcare initiatives.

This is quite a myth. Fast food and ready meals, the general staples of unhealthy eating, are widely consumed out of convenience more than anything. Cooking a healthy meal from component ingredients is almost always cheaper than either of the above.

And fruit/veg are not THAT expensive, they're quite reasonable compared to alternatives.
 
 
 
For example the minimum amount of chicken in a chicken fillet should be 80% etc. That way not only will it mean that fast food chains can't sell 'chicken' that is mostly just salted water and fattening chemicals, hence making the food healthier, but they wouldn't be able to sell foods so cheaply if they're better quality and original food.

 

True. For the most part fast food chains are okay though. But for chicken quite a few of them seem to fail.. It's a good point though, a valid one, but it would require a massive change. It will require a whole new kind of labelling system, a whole revamp of certain mass producers who may be involved with providing such chicken and stuff. Ultimately it would cost people money which i think is the biggest problem with it (why they aren't doing it i mean)

 
banning marmite over food safety.
 

NOOOOOOO. No-one is taking marmite away from me !  
 
 
 
It's not going to make any difference. Cigarettes are ludicrously expensive - doesn't stop people smoking though. Same thing here.

 

Even if it doesn't deter people from eating unhealthy foods, the extra money goes into their health system.

The obese put a huge strain on the health system due to their bad lifestyle choices (Rather beautifully those who eat well but have a condition making them put weight on uncontrollably aren't affected). This system means it will be them who will foot the bill for obesity related diseases and not the whole population, that being said I doubt the tax will cover even 10% of the expenditure.

Where you draw the line on these taxes isn't black and white. For example if you taxed climbers extra due to their higher risk of injury, most would say that was ridiculous. By adding these taxes you eventually end up paying the equivalent of health insurance. But since obesity is avoidable and caused by an unhealthy relationship with food (Both mentally and physically) which results in low self-esteem and restricts what the individual can actually do, IMO this doesn't cross the line.
 
 
What about slim people with high metabolisms? Why should they have to pay more to maintain their weight?

I can see the reasoning behind introducing a tax on unhealthy aspects of foods, such as those foods with a very high salt content, providing the money is used to subsidise healthy foods, but to tax things because they have high amounts of sugar in them, for example, is unfair.
 
 
well it either lowers obesity rates... or makes the government some money...

seems like a win-win to me...

bag of tesco value frozen oven chips : 74p
bag of tesco market value white potatoes : £1.89

packet of 8 tesco's value frozen chicken burgers : £1
packet of fresh tesco's market value chicken breasts (approximately 5 or 6 breasts): £4

packet of 8 tesco value economy frozen beef burgers : 79p
packet of fresh tesco's value beef frying steak (approximately 5 or 6 steaks) : £1.56

heaven forbid I should start looking at the even healthier fat reduced or organic or tesco's finest produce. You're talking, for example :

500g tesco fresh healthy living mince steak : £3.30 (Which would obviously be £6.60 for 1kg) (100g = 125 calories)
vs
1kg tesco market value frozen mince : £2.50 (100g = 295 calories)

big difference between £2.50 and £6.60 for the same amount of mince. You're paying for it being leaner and having less calories and fat and so on.

So yes, healthier food is a LOT dearer than unhealthy food.

even if you want to compare frozen vs frozen, or fresh vs fresh :

like I said, the 500g tesco fresh healthy living mince steak = £3.30
whereas
tesco fresh value beef mince = £1.50

no prizes for guessing which of the two has less fat and less calories!

Same happens with frozen. The healthier the product, the dearer it costs.

Believe me, I feed a family of 5, I know how hard it is to be able to afford healthy food. I pay £6 for extra lean mince meat, whereas I could go for the cheaper value mince for £2 which is way more calorific as it is not lean at all. I don't do that, I pay the extra, but my shopping bill suffers immensely. I don't buy half as much fresh fruit as I would like because I simply can't afford it.

What a pile of c**p. Most people don't get overweight due to their genetics but rather they eat too much. Haven't you ever wondered why its only now that people are becoming increasingly overweight. Its because food has become more readily available and cheaper in the last decades. If it was all down to genetics then why is this all new and why is it suddenly such a big issue? btw im not saying genetics doesn't have anything to do with your weight, it will be a factor, but the amount people eat will be the main issue
 
 
 
This is quite a myth.

 

no its not a myth. healthier food, even if you're talking about using raw ingredients, is dearer. Please see my above post.

edited to add : yes cooking at home is cheaper than eating takeaways, but if you're talking about shopping in a supermarket, generally products that are leaner and have less fat or calories, are dearer than the products with more fat. Potatoes are dearer than chips. chicken breasts are dearer than breaded chicken burgers etc.
 
 
Think this is a step in the right direction, because there are clearly too many obese people in the UK now.

I also think that any obesity related treatment should have to be paid for by privately unless said obesity is due to a pre-existing medical condition (i.e. one that has not come about because of the person getting themselves obese).

Wow. that was the worst piece of drivvzle ever.

Firstly, you completely fail because you try to compare the whole product, not the part you will be using. Which is utterly absurd.

Secondly, you don't even use ready meals.

See that 1.kg frozen mince? Can feed 5 people off of that. 50p each for that ingredient. Done. Doesn't look as expensive does it now?

Shame I am feeding a troll, but my brother eats like a horse and he is now 33. Whenever theres a football match on he goes through 2 LARGE kebabs, 2 portions of chips, a 2 litre bottle of pepsi, about 2-6 cans of pop, 24 packs of crisps and one of those extra extra large chocolate.

Hes barely 10 stone, but he does have a birth defect with his kidney but I doubt that affects it and he gets a bus or taxi everywhere and never exercises, my ex flatmate is a stoner and doesnt leave the house for days and eats like 2 or 3 pizzas a day, can drink a 2 litre bottle of pop in a hour etc and never exercises.

I am overweight and I dont pig out but just eat processed food and have never had any health issues relating to my weight, I did a 50 minute walk to a supermarket a few days ago and same back with heavy bags, not all fat people = massive problems for health services just like saying that zero thin people never have health problems.

So then people should east fewer chips/burgers. Where is the issue? No food is inherently unhealthy aside from hydrogenated fats; you could live off chicken burgers and chips and maintain a healthy weight if you wanted. Most people don't realise you get fat by eating too many calories, as opposed to too large a volume of food - this is the problem.

just like you think that somebody with lung cancer from smoking should pay for their own medical treatment privately because they chose to smoke?

just like you think that somebody with lung cancer from passive smoking should pay for their own medical treatment privately because it was their own choice to stand near people who smoke?

the 1kg frozen mince was the cheaper UNHEALTHIER product though. The point was that the fresh healthy living mince was the healthy expensive one. So I'm sorry but you entirely missed what I was saying.

oh and you point me in the direction of an American article, dealing with how much food costs in America? Real helpful...thanks for that.

I agree. I purposely eat some fatty foods to become more healthy and athletic. In what way is someone like me causing costs to health services.

They would be better off everybody going for a health check and those that are deemed as unhealthy or obese have to pay extra taxes. That way its fairer on those people who do not cause the government unnecessary costs in terms of obesity

How the **** is it unhealthy?  

I don't think you understand what it means.

To buy healthy food is not to buy the MOST healthy food. Jesus christ.

So a obese person who doesnt cause the government extra costs automatically has to pay higher taxes?

What happens to all the 18 year olds living to excess but their age makes them seem more healthy?

In cases like this people use logic, since they dont understand people who are overweight they say "oh but all it takes to not be overweight is to eat right" a case of if I can do it than so can everyone else.
 
 
 
Says the one who thinks mince is unhealthy food  

 

Have you ever had frozen mince? I got some before trying to eat better and it was mostly fat, after putting the mince on the plate the plate was packed with grease and the pan was at least 1/3 full of fat/grease compared to even the cheapest Tesco value packet mince had little fat.

Yes i have, and i have been recommended stuff by nutritionists thank you  .

It was not 'mostly fat'. But thanks for exaggerating to make a point.
 
 
 
just like you think that anybody who has a car accident should pay for their own medical treatment privately, because it was their own choice to get into the car?
Accidental, happens very quickly. No, they shouldn't have to pay.

just like you think that somebody with lung cancer from smoking should pay for their own medical treatment privately because they chose to smoke?
Yes, I do - but I believe that it is covered by the extortionate price of cigarettes, is it not?

just like you think that somebody with lung cancer from passive smoking should pay for their own medical treatment privately because it was their own choice to stand near people who smoke?
No, that is absurd. Person Y cannot stop person X smoking, and may need to be around them. The smoke is not the fault of person Y, and neither is their health problem because of it.

just like you think that all women should have to pay privately to give birth in a clinic, because it was their own choice to have sex?
Without birth we'd become extinct. Birth is vital. Obesity and overeating is not. What an utterly ludicrous comparison to make.

just like you think that somebody who falls off a horse and breaks bones, should pay for their own medical treatment privately, because it was their ow choice to go horse riding?
Again, you can fall off a horse in a split second, and the damage be done. Obesity does not occur overnight. It is easy to spot that you're gaining weight, and easy to stop. People who choose to continue eating too many calories are blatantly putting their health at risk. It is therefore their own fault when they do end up with a health condition because of it.

 

Possibly the worst comparisons I've come across on TSR to date.
 
 
It's actually quite a good idea, although I thought I'd oppose something like this. Part of me sees this as an encroachment upon human rights (you're now penalised for eating what you want to eat), but then another part of me sees the huge benefits this could have. Foods that can lead to obesity produce a lot of externalities that currently aren't paid for by those that consume them. That said, this also penalises those who eat such foods only rarely, admittedly not by as much. Overall, though, I think it's a great idea. Healthy food suddenly becomes more attractive to millions.

I am NOT exaggerating I bought frozen mince and it was mostly fat and I am quite tolerant of food and live off things like Tesco Value a lot but this was absolutely awful.

It was eatable but even the cheapest packet mince was leagues ahead by a massive amount.

That's a good point, but the fact of the matter is that it's less fair to make everyone pay for the cost than just obese people. They're more likely to cause extra healthcare costs, and must pay for that contingency as a result. The more junk food someone eats, the higher their chance of using healthcare becomes, but so too does the cost that they pay for that chance. It's the fairest way by a country mile.
 
 
 
So a obese person who doesnt cause the government extra costs automatically has to pay higher taxes?

What happens to all the 18 year olds living to excess but their age makes them seem more healthy?

In cases like this people use logic, since they dont understand people who are overweight they say "oh but all it takes to not be overweight is to eat right" a case of if I can do it than so can everyone else.

 

Yeah I totally understand what your saying. My comment was just a suggestion (and obviously not a very well thought out one!)

An obese person is likely to cost the government money as they continue to become more obese and eventually need help because of it (usually something they caused them self). But I am obviously no expert so don't take what I'm saying too seriously.

I also agree that the young people damaging there own bodys through excessive alcohol and drug in take would also have to follow the same sort of rules. But as I said I am no expert and for thorough tests to be done and decide whether someone is causing damage to themselves or not and whether someone is unhealthy or not is something impossible. It just something that seems sensible in theory.

I understand what your saying about some people not being able to lose weight in the same way others do. The fact is we're all different. Some people gain weight easily where as anorexic people do not. Some people just plain and simple have to work harder than others. But life isn't fair. But this fits onto a continuum where some people could lose wight with ease, others find it difficult, others find it completely impossible so it is one of those things that only works in theory

Edit: I agree with the above comment though, it is very unfair to make people who work their asses off day in and day out to be healthy and athletic to pay the same taxes and those who deserve it (a very debatable topic).
 
 
 
Definately yes, why should normal sized people have to pay the price for people who are unable to practice self constrant when it comes to food? Though i think it is wrong to tax for certain food types, while it means that the money can be used to pay for health care etc it will do nothing to decrease obesity levels. Instead if someone who is obese wants to see a doctor they should pay the full price for the service, with an exception made for health problems that make it hard for people to stay at a correct weight.
There wont be a discount for people on benefits either. If someone can afford to eat to excess they can afford to pay for it.
Think something similar should be introduced for smokers and binge drinkers. They way people choose to live their lives should be cost neutral on the NHS

 

I thought the NHS was supposed to work for us, not the other way round?
 
 
A lot of people will be going hungry in Hungary from now on...
 
 
Maybe a way of taxing those who are obese/overweight due to overeating would be better, since they will probably end up costing the NHS more on average.
 
 
Good. The one time my liberalism falters is with food. Fatties are bad for themselves and the environment. They should receive the same propaganda hatred that smokers did five years ago.
 
 
Why not just use the revenue generated from the 'fat tax' and find some way of subsidising fruit and vegetables. That way people who don't buy it just because it is more costly will think twice.
 
 
Even if it doesn't stop people buying junk food at the very least extra money is going to the health care system to help it support those who are obese.
 
 
 
In an effort to address rising obesity rates and health care costs, Hungary on Thursday implemented a law imposing special taxes on foods with high fat, salt and sugar content.
The move comes as other European countries also consider policies to fight obesity.

Beginning Sept. 1, Hungarians will have to pay a 10 forint (€ 0.37) tax on foods with high fat, sugar and salt content, as well as increased tariffs on soda and alcohol.
The expected annual proceeds of €70 million will go toward state health care costs, including those associated with addressing the country's 18.8 percent obesity rate

There are also questions over the effectiveness of fat-tax legislation. The growing list of taxes on unhealthy foods is leading to a debate on whether an increase in taxes can actually translate to a decrease in obesity.

Scientific research shows that taxation is not an effective instrument in addressing consumer behavior and will have no impact on obesity rates," McCooey argued.
"Consumer information and education, not tax, is the way to advance consumer understanding of healthy eating.

The link between the price of a product and its purchase is clear and has been well substantiated," countered EPHA's Turnbull. But, he added, taxes alone cannot lead to healthier habits. "Combined with health promotion measures designed to increase awareness of the health issues associated with a poor diet, the impact of fiscal measures applied to food policy can be significant."

So see the mentioned article  here 

So Hungary are now doing it (although some experts believe it wont do much at all) although not on a full on scale. Other countries are thinking about it, the general view is that many will soon follow.

Over a quarter of British adults are now overweight. With projections being a figure closer to 40% by 2030. That would be over £2bn in spending  by the NHS  to cope.
But for many, this will never be enough; ' But for many experts this is not enough. The Lancet researchers have argued tougher action - such as legislation - is needed to tackle the issue.'

So what is your view on a UK 'Fat Tax'?, yes or no? Should we be more forcefuland put in some kind of legislation?

 

Fat Tax = Amazing Idea.... Why should the taxpayer pay for irresponsible people who can't/don't want to help themselves..?

When the government wanted to increase unit cost of drink there was a massive uproar, yet it was all down to binge drinkers causing problem.

Same idea here you cant pick and choose your fights because you dont like the sort of people it affects.

It's a good idea, but I think it should levied elsewhere. I eat lots of fatty foods, yet I cost the NHS very little; it is therefore unfair to make me pay extra for fatty food. Levy it as part of income tax or something

These are completely incomparable...Binge drinkers make up a relatively small part of the population, compared to obesity which is the single biggest problem facing the generation (with 1/3 of adults and children currently obese or overweight).

Secondly from a scientific perspective, obesity has MANY more ailments associated with it, ranging to sevre ulcers to cardiovascular disease, thus it is an issue which costs the NHS and wider taxpayer far more money than binge drinkers.

Tax unhealthy foods, use the money to subsidise healthy foods.

It widens the price gap between healthy and unhealthy foods, but doesn't raise the overall cost of living.
 
 
No; it punishes people who enjoy those foods in moderation and with proper diet and exercise. A better idea would be to make people pay for their own obesity related health problems - have the NHS refuse treatment for things like gastric bands, liposuction and obesity related diseases thereby making them seek private healthcare.
 
 
 
well sure, but healthy food in itself is very expensive.. The cost of fresh fruit and veg and meat is just sky high.

 

No it's not, not in terms of nutritional content per pound. I don't know how much junk food costs, but it must be more money than making it yourself.

In other news, I'm sure no-one's going to go "Hungary" thanks to this.
 
 
Perfectly good idea. Even if it doesn't solve the actual problem of obesity, it will go some way pay for the consequences of it.
 
 
You can eat healthily and still be overweight/obese. It's the volume of food being consumed that tends to be the problem, rather than the type. People just need to be more educated when it comes to health and fitness - one of the main issues in this country is that a lot of people don't know how to cook from scratch, so resort to cheap fast-food instead.
 
 
That's a pretty hefty tax. I dunno. What about people who eat a treat? Might it be better to increase costs of healthcare for people who are obese without a good medical reason?

But then you get into BMI and that crap, which is proven to be largely bogus.
 
 
 
No; it punishes people who enjoy those foods in moderation and with proper diet and exercise. A better idea would be to make people pay for their own obesity related health problems - have the NHS refuse treatment for things like gastric bands, liposuction and obesity related diseases thereby making them seek private healthcare.

 

That's why they should use my idea. If the tax on unhealthy foods is used to subsidise healthy foods then people who have unhealthy food in moderation will probably end up saving money.

That's completely against what the NHS represents. It doesn't matter if their illness is self-inflicted, you don't start charging people for medical treatment. Sure stuff like liposuction is cosmetic and gastric bands aren't necessary but if someone's obese and has heart problems as a result, I don't want them to be charged for getting treatment for that. I think better regulation is needed of food.
 
 
 
this fat tax should be imposed on people who are fat only

 

This.

I'm one of those skinny people who eats everything but never gains weight. It's so annoying when food companies change their products to make them healthier which just makes things taste so bland. Damn fattys ruining things for the rest of us!

(I've still not gotten over turkey twizzlers being discontinued).

Slightly off topic but couldn't resist a mini rant.
 
 
Well if fatty foods were more expensive than healthier foods people might be more inclined to buy healthy instead when deciding how to best fill their empty stomachs on a £1
Though after 4 pages I have the sneaking suspicion this may have already been said

I agree. A change in what constitutes cosmetic care might be in order? Certainly more strict requirements on 'prescription dieting' might be in order. With appropriate support.

I don't see why we should have to pay for the slothful and gluttonous being negligent of their own health when the NHS is seriously strapped for cash. My friend's 14-year-old cousin had a rare cancer and had to have part of his treatment paid for privately in the US because the NHS cannot afford to purchase the specialist equipment or fund the treatment, and yet they're spending billions on people who are willingly eating themselves to death. That's wrong.
 
 
 
That's why they should use my idea. If the tax on unhealthy foods is used to subsidise healthy foods then people who have unhealthy food in moderation will probably end up saving money.

 

Good idea. It would both discourage unhealthy food buying and encourage healthy food buying. Also, if people buy less of the bad food due to its cost then the companies making it may be forced to find healthier ingredients to avoid the tax and keep their profit margins healthy.
 
 
 
You can eat healthily perfectly well on £1 a meal instead of buying a ready meal  

 

Got any examples of a healthy £1 meal? I'd genuinely like to know.

If I buy chicken kievs and chips in bulk it works out at under £1 a meal. So if there was a more healthy alternative that's just as easy to cook (i.e. shove it an oven), and keeps for a long time (I hate shopping) then I could get that instead.
 
 
 
It's not going to make any difference. Cigarettes are ludicrously expensive - doesn't stop people smoking though. Same thing here.

 

Yeah but the thing is... chicken nuggets don't have addictive chemicals in them.
 
 
 
You can eat healthily perfectly well on £1 a meal instead of buying a ready meal  

 

Any suggestions? ones that have less than 30 minutes which most ready meals can extend up to.
 
 
 
I don't think it would make a difference- people would just pay the higher price.

It's a good idea though, I wonder if it will work!

 

Even if they did it would raise extra tax renevue which can be spend on the NHS

True, i'm not sure the extra revenue would actually be enough to support our increasingly fat population though :/
 
 
Now the people of Hungary will be hungry.
 
 
There's an unfairness at the heart of it though, which is that people of a healthy weight will also be charged more for crisps, cakes, carbonated drinks, etc.

Why? We're a healthy weight. How is that fair?
 
 
Also, I hope it was worth resurrecting the thread for that bad pun.

It's fair if they get cheaper healthy food to balance it out.

I guess the problem with subsidising healthy food is that it could distort the market. It would encourage food companies to push more healthy food which is good, but what they might do is keep the price to the consumer the same and just make more profit from them instead of offering the consumer cheaper healthy food.

Well ideally I'd have a system where those who drink more alcohol and smoke more cigarettes pay increasingly more tax, and the 'fat tax' could work in the same way, the problem is that I don't know how such a thing could be implemented.
 
 
Yes definitely. Non-conformance with the British Standard Human should be punished with the full force of the law. Those dreadful fat people who do 'wrong' things, like eating a kebab or a cake, how could they do such a thing? Bring back the death penalty.
 
 
 
So what is your view on a UK 'Fat Tax'?, yes or no? Should we be more forcefuland put in some kind of legislation?

 

Tricky one. I suspect as someone pointed out that this won't stop people eating unhealthily. All it will do is encourage people to increase their income to pay for it. This in turn will just increase inequality.

Good point.

 
well sure, but healthy food in itself is very expensive.. The cost of fresh fruit and veg and meat is just sky high.

So we're going to have a nation of hungry people if they introduce this over here, in that case. People still won't be able to afford the healthy stuff, and they won't be able to afford unhealthy stuff either if its taxed.

What a stupid comparison. For starters, I dont even know of a 'Crispy Creme' shop anywhere in my area, so I wouldnt be able to buy there.

You are comparing a premium unhealthy product with the cheapest healthy things.

The donuts I would buy if I wanted them cost 20-25p each. So 4-5 for a £1, ergo much cheaper than healthy things.

For example:

Breakfast:
6 Free range eggs from a supermarket: £1.39, would make say 3 meals of 2 poached eggs on toast.
VS:
Massive box of sugary cereal: £1.50-£2 for about 20-30 servings depending on brand.

Even wholemeal bread costs more than white for toast.

Lunch:
Lets say... sandwich (£2) healthy salad (£1.00-£1.50) with Orange juice (£1 bottle.) Total £4-5.
VS:
Bag of chips (£1.70), or pasties or sausage rolls (even cheaper!). Donut 30p. Fizzy drink (£1). Total - £3.

Tea/Dinner:
Chicken + Pasta, lets say you are cooking for a family of 4. Enough chicken = £6, Sauce = £2-2.50, pasta = say 50p. Total: £9.
VS:
4 Ready meals of Italian food: £4, OR 1 big ready meal of Italian food = £5.

Dessert:
Healthy yoghurt (£2) and berries (£1.50-£2) total £3-5, servings say 4, 8 if you spend another £2 on fruit.
VS:
Massive cake or many individual cakes £2.50-3.50, servings average about 6-8 depending on size.

Snacks:
Healthy cereal bars £2 for about 8.
VS:
Crisps multi-pack of 16 for the same price.

You could argue it back and forth, but the bottom line is if you want to save money, buy unhealthy.

I subscribe to the 'why the hell is healthy food so expensive' camp. Seriously, you have to cook a donut and package it, yet it can sell for 20p when a bunch of grapes is £1.50? What? How does that encourage healthy eating?
 
 
 
Breakfast:
6 Free range eggs from a supermarket: £1.39, would make say 3 meals of 2 poached eggs on toast.
VS:
Massive box of sugary cereal: £1.50-£2 for about 20-30 servings depending on brand.

 

Unless you are a 12 year old child. A box of cereal will not last that much. Given we are talking about eating properly. I get a 750g box/bag and it lasts me about 8 days. You also have not factored milk into account. My 4pt milks last for around 5 or 6 days for cereal (its the only thing i have it with) Cereal + milk would cost like £3 - £3.50 depending on what kinda stuff you want. Heck milk may not even last that long for some people. This is going to cost like 35-45p a day.

Get eggs 24 for £4. Bread at like £1 a loaf. Its going to cost like.. what.. 40p a time?

Heck.. you can get cheap cereal that is healthy, so this is already a fail comparison.

 
Lunch:
Lets say... sandwich (£2) healthy salad (£1.00-£1.50) with Orange juice (£1 bottle.) Total £4-5.
VS:
Bag of chips (£1.70), or pasties or sausage rolls (even cheaper!). Donut 30p. Fizzy drink (£1). Total - £3.
 

Wut is this nonsense?

Slices of bread going to be less than 10p a slice. Butter.. cba to work that out. Buy prepacked salad bunches. E.g. big cabbage for 50p. Orange juice at 60p ish per big carton. Much better than your nonsense isn't it  

 
Tea/Dinner:
Chicken + Pasta, lets say you are cooking for a family of 4. Enough chicken = £6, Sauce = £2-2.50, pasta = say 50p. Total: £9.
VS:
4 Ready meals of Italian food: £4, OR 1 big ready meal of Italian food = £5.
 

£6 FOR 4 PEOPLE? What are you talking about?!.
2 chickens for like £7. That's £3.50 for a whole chicken. That alone could equate to enough meat for quite a few meals equating to less than 50p ish each per person per meal. Even less for kids. Meaning a rough estimate of like £1.50 per meal.

Pasta is like £1.20 for a kg. That's going to be at least 2 meals for the family. So we'll say it will cost 60p. That's £2 ish for the meal for everyone. With sauces easily made via using small amounts of milk & cheese etc.

 
Dessert:
Healthy yoghurt (£2) and berries (£1.50-£2) total £3-5, servings say 4, 8 if you spend another £2 on fruit.
VS:
Massive cake or many individual cakes £2.50-3.50, servings average about 6-8 depending on size.
 

Such a massive fail.

Why are your only comparisons the obviously inflated healthy options when someone could quite easily get a 'healthy massive cake' or simply make their own?. It is quite pathetic really.

Cheap deserts can be fruit salad, boiled mango, chocolate on bananas, fruit cobler etc etc etc. All of which will be cheaper.

 
Snacks:
Healthy cereal bars £2 for about 8.
VS:
Crisps multi-pack of 16 for the same price.
 

Hmm.. so cereal bars are the only healthy snacks? alright  

I can't be assed to work it out, but my dad makes his own cereal bars and it works out at around 8 - 10p each and almost as healthy as the normal branded ones.

Other options:
Dry roasted peanuts - Around £1.50 for a 400 - 500g bag.
Raw carrots. - Less than a quid per kilo.
Apples - £1 per kilo.
Bananas - £0.70 per kilo
Buy some oats, munch on cereal alone, eat some tuna
Etc Etc

So.
Breakfast - Around the same cost. But was a fail comparison as healthy cereals can be just as cheap. Infact most cereals are healthier options than a lot of stuff.
Lunch - Going by the fact you want chips etc, the homemade lunch will cost much, much less.
Dinner - Will cost less.
Dessert - Will probably cost around the same because of the cost of large bags of fruit.

If you are going to try and compare things, at least use real prices and not ridiculous comparisons.
 
 
 
It's not going to make any difference. Cigarettes are ludicrously expensive - doesn't stop people smoking though. Same thing here.

 

It doesn't matter if it doesn't stop them smoking or getting fat etc. It only matter that they get punished and clobbered with taxes because they do something I find revolting to me and I'm happier as a result.

So I'd love to see the fatties being punished at the tills, who know, they might even run out of money and eat a bit less, or eat a bit less well, in which case they'll die that much faster while decreasing our NHS load AND contributing higher taxes.
 
 
 
Tricky one. I suspect as someone pointed out that this won't stop people eating unhealthily. All it will do is encourage people to increase their income to pay for it. This in turn will just increase inequality.

Yeah there are some luxury unhealthy foods that are very expensive. Like Ben and Jerry's ice cream. But there's also some food that's not really very healthy but cheap crap if you buy it in bulk. Plus it's far easier to cook, you just shove it in the oven.
 
 
I don't see why, as somebody who is of a healthy weight and exercises, I should be punished because Fat Tony in the corner can't control his weight. A sweaty kebab, a dirty burger or a greasy pizza shouldn't cost me more because some people consider them every day food. The costs of food are high enough as it is.
 
 
If a tax was selective enough so it could make certain foods significantly more expensive, and there was a parallel tax reduction in something else, it would be worth trying.

I'll have to call you up on that. Ready meals are not whole meals. Maybe for children, but you I don't think you could properly feed two adults and two children on just a ready meal each. Especially one that costs £1.

 
Get eggs 24 for £4. Bread at like £1 a loaf. Its going to cost like.. what.. 40p a time?

 

What if you're buying for just yourself? Bread I can freeze, that's fine, but I don't even bother buying packs of 6 eggs because they will go off before I get the chance to eat them. Buying cheap crap is so much easier for me because I can buy it in bulk and freeze it.

But on the flip side, it makes sense for the government to put higher taxes on things that ultimately cost them more. People being unhealthy does ultimately cost the government more, so you can argue it makes sense to tax the thing that makes them unhealthy.
 
 
Hrrm, that's nice and all, but 10 forints really is nothing!!

Surely it'd be better to do it as a percentage of the total price rather than a fixed amount to give more of an impact?
I agree with the idea on the whole, though. It probably won't stop many from buying things, but the money could certainly come in handy, especially if used to subsidise healthier products.

Have to say I'm surprised that Hungary are the first to do it. Excuse my ignorance, I've got no idea about figures, but I didn't see a single overweight person anywhere when I visited.
 
 
 
Yeah but the thing is... chicken nuggets don't have addictive chemicals in them.

 

That's debatable.

Salt, sugar and various other stimulants - caffeine, chemicals etc are addictive and are the reason people eat these foods in the first place.

 
There's an unfairness at the heart of it though, which is that people of a healthy weight will also be charged more for crisps, cakes, carbonated drinks, etc.

Why? We're a healthy weight. How is that fair?

 

Valid point but what else do you do - create a new income tax for the obese?

It's also not fair that two people can eat the same junk food day in day out, and one ends up obese, the other skinny. The only difference being genetics and their metabolisms (not their fault).

 
I don't see why, as somebody who is of a healthy weight and exercises, I should be punished because Fat Tony in the corner can't control his weight. A sweaty kebab, a dirty burger or a greasy pizza shouldn't cost me more because some people consider them every day food. The costs of food are high enough as it is.

 

Bit harsh. Ridiculing people won't help the matter.

Actually obesity is in my opinion a problem rooted in society and culture - something which we all contribute towards. So therefore technically it is all of our's fault and responsibility to tackle it together. Better this way than say 'well he's fat so he can pay extra' etc. Take responsibility for the world around you which you contribute towards.
 
 
Also if they charge extra for food packed with sugar for example, won't that just increase the presence of artificial sweeteners to replace it?

You make a good argument and I fully empathise that certain people are overweight despite eating the recommended amount of food because of an underlying medical condition. My suspicion however is that the average overweight person is such because they eat simply more.

The only vaguely workable solution that I can think of is that each person gets a set quota of unhealthy foods which they can buy which are tax free, go over that quota and you pay incrementally more tax. Each person gets say a 'Ration card' in the post which is a swipe card, and has a photographic ID on it. You pay at the counter, your card is swiped by the staff and your bill is adjusted based on how much unhealthy food you have bought in the last week or so. So you have like an 'account', showing how many much more you can buy, or how much you've gone over.

For parents doing the family shopping, maybe a family version of the card can be made, which links in to the children's and parent's individual 'accounts'. It can be age and gender adjusted too, and all that stuff.
 
 
dont agree with it at all

I refer to those takeaways like that in every day life.

There's still no excuse for it - unless it's a psychological issue. In which case, you need help, help which should be provided by the state. Addiction is terrible.

People who eat bad food day in, day out and make no effort to exercise, change their diet or in any other way become healthy have only themselves to blame. I still don't believe that I should have to pay more for a one off naughty treat.

I suspect the government very rarely scrutinises taxes with a cost benefit analysis.

Interesting idea. I think there does need to be some form of intervention from the state. Whether it is in the form of allowances like you suggest or an outright ban.

I think there could also be subtle changes introduced by the government. What do you think....

- The state could introduce regulation whereby for every 2 fast food outlets opened in a street/ shopping mall, there must be at least one healthy alternative where all of the food served is fresh and free from excessive amounts of salt, sugar, fat etc. This will prevent fast food outlets dominating the surrounding area.
- Introduce a 4 day week, or alternatively 5/6 hour working days. This will allow more time for home cooking, quality family time together and more relaxation time meaning people won't always be 'on the go' and won't need fast food as much.
- State regulation of supermarkets and food outlets to ensure that there is proportional space for healthy food vs unhealthy. For example, in my local Tesco, the alcohol section and crisp aisle is at least 5 times the size of the fruit and veg.
- Encourage fast food outlets to produce more healthy food and reduce the level of stimulants in the food. For example, mcdonalds could use less salt in fries, less (or more healthy) oil in the fries, lean meat and cheese etc
- Promote healthy affordable food outlets. Market them at teens and make them cool. Not an easy task but if it's done well could prove very successful. A celebrity such as Jamie Oliver could potentially use their status to do this and succeed with it. Jamie Oliver fast food?
- Educate people about the risks of obesity. Display gruesome photographs on fast food packaging like with tobacco?
- Use vouchers like you say and ensure people are aware when they have consumed too much salt, sugar etc. Or even better
- Introduce a system whereby fast food is only available via tokens. Those tokens are only given out once the consumer has completed x amount of exercise first?
- Reduce 'comfort eating' by providing adequate support for problems such as stress, anxiety and depression
- Ban kebab houses, chip shops from opening after 9pm thus preventing drunken binges
- Invest in systems to produce healthy alternatives to junk food that tastes just as good

anyway, just a few brainstorms....

I don't think any of your solutions are that good (no offence). They are in some respects excessively draconian, and in others completely impossible to maintain. For instance, if it was easy to create an affordable tasty fast food, do you not think a company would have done this already? Because I don't. I think some better ones might be a several step plan.

Firstly, there needs to be a massive tax slapped on rubbish foods so it becomes uneconomical to buy the cheapest easiest option - i'm not talking 10 or 20%, i'm talking 100-200%. Having moved to the North from a small town down south it is a bloody disgrace up here. You can, even on the dole, afford to get crappy fast food ordered in every night. It costs like £2 for an 11 inch pizza, which is disgusting. In comparison, in the town I come from a take away is a treat. There is one kebab shop, and one dominos, and the rest are all 'real' restaurants. The levels of obesity are wildly different between the two places - in Leeds where I currently am, I would estimate that at least half the adult population here is at least slightly fat, and the levels of morbid obesity here are astronomical. In the town down south there are still a fair amount of fatties, but probably half the amount compared to up north. It really isn't easy up here to live the healthy life once you've fallen into the trap of not having to cook for yourself - or more importantly wash up.

Secondly, the money made from taxing the rubbish foods should be used to subsidise fresh foods - meat, veg, pasta, noodles etc. Furthermore people need to be taught in school how to use these ingredients. I don't know the stats, if they exist, but I think a significant portion of the population couldn't boil an egg, let alone cook a nice meal for their families.

Thirdly, some money needs to be redirected towards building gyms that are affordable for your average working class person, and close enough to their work that they can easily pop in before or after or even during lunch.

Fourthly, people need to be shown what a real portion is. They also need to be given significant support to lose the weight they have gained.

Finally, fizzy drinks need to have a substantially higher tax placed on them. I suspect these drinks are where many are consuming the extra empty calories that make them fat. Special offers on these drinks also need to be banned. When we were all younger the idea of drinking more than a couple of cans of coke per week was laughable; A can may have only been 50p, but it seems 50p meant a whole lot more to everyone back then. Now it's not hard to pick up 6 liters of coke for £3, or even cheaper than this if you shop own brand. It should not go unnoticed that coke has made it it's explicit mission to be bigger than water.

Basically, we need a system which makes treats treats again. We need schools to go back to doing chips on 'chip Friday', not every day of the week. We need people to know how to cook good healthy foods, and have access to them at an affordable price. And we need to make it cheaper and easier for people to get their exercise in, when we are becoming an increasingly immobile society.
 
 
I came to this thread expecting good things, what I got was truly awful. This isn't a fat tax, just a tax on unhealthy foods. That means that a healthy, athletic person who looks after their body, has to pay a "fat tax". That's not a fat tax, it's just a tax.

A fat tax is something that's implemented on only fat people. This isn't a fat tax. A true fat tax would be excellent to see.
