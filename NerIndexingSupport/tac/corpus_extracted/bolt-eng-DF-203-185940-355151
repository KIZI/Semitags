 
 
GTG: The National Challenge
 
 
It seems that many of us have trouble making new friends in new cities, are lonely, want new people in their lives, etc.
I think we should have MM GTGs nationwide on the same day at the same time.
What cities have lots of MM Nesties?
We're already friends online. Why not be friends for real?
Let's make this happen!  Point persons here  !
 
 
I know there are a bunch in the Boston/Providence area. We had a GTG a few years ago.
For the real old-timers (Boston circa 2002/2003)... I wore my Knot Your Typical Fan t-shirt from the Sox GTG to bed last night and couldn't believe it was 9 years old. Ha!
 
 
DC Nesties. And, I am in for that get together, if you'll have me. I recently reached Bronze status!
 
 
It took me a year of daily chatting with mfluder before I caved & met her. I already knew she'd become my BFF, but I am shy!
Im much less insecure when I'm 50 lbs thinner *cries*
 
 
Many years ago, grrly and I hosted a MM "new england" gtg. It was outside of Boston and we had maybe 10 people come. It was pretty fun.
I met kirkette when she came to Providence for a race in August. That was super fun!
I should hang out with FlamingoStalker more often. She lives maybe 5 miles from me. :)

But aren't you SO HAPPY that you guys finally met?
I'm going to get all corny and sappy now, but I really value the friendships I've made on this board and others.

That's right. The D.C. girls do GTG!
 
 
I am Northern CA but I am willing to make a weekend out of it to meet some Southern CA gals!!

On my anniversary board, we did a Chicago GTG last year. All of us from different states came together. It was a blast!!

I can't believe you guys don't see each other more often.
Make it happen!

I can't imagine my life without her! Yes, very glad :) You're right. Gotta just put yourself out there.

Haha, I didn't see this while I was posting my reply. We should totally do another GTG. Maybe rikki will come since she is the one who started the posting trend :)

Any Twin Cities nesties?
 
 
So here is my incredibly dorky idea.
We pick a date and time.
We have these GTGs simultaneously.
We use FaceTime to link up.
Nationwide GTG.  
 
 
And I am aware that many people are laughing at me right now.

You know, I was thinking about that last night while wearing my GTG t-shirt and cooking dinner! Amamba came to my house for lunch one day while I was on maternity leave. That was 2 years ago! Amamba, we need to get together again!

I really want this to happen.
Can you please be friends with rikki? And with liveintheville while you're at it? LOL.
 
 
Should I come?
 
 
 
Any Twin Cities nesties?
 

I believe there are a number of us. I'd attend a Twin Cities MM gtg.
 
 
I'm missing something... who is rikki?
 
 
 
Should I come?
 

I would be nice to you. I promise.
I can't speak for Wan. LOL.
 
 
KC could come up with a pretty sizable group. I've only met CJ but she was pretty great. I think there's at least 5 of us. It's about damn time we got our acts together!
 
 
CajunMom is in my area. And gettingfit, though I haven't seen her around lately. Any other south Louisiana ladies?
 
 
 
I'm missing something... who is rikki?

 

She's a nice MM Nestie who lives in the Boston area.
 She would like more friends .
Please be her new friend!
 
 
I'm totally in!

This sounds fun! I stopped posting on 9/08, and I'm sad I missed this now.
I think NJ MMers have GTGs and I'm close enough that I would attend a NYC GTG. But I still don't post a lot and would feel like a stalker trying to attend one since I don't think anyone knows who I am.  
 
 
Whatever happened to the MM Vegas GTG? I have a coupon for 5% off an order of 20 or more lanyards.

Ah, I missed that one. Since becoming a teacher, I've missed out on a lot during the day. I get home early, but have little man to take care of. I don't get on the nest until later.
Rikki, come to a GTG with us! :)
I grew up in MA and work in MA, but live just over the border in RI.

Baby steps.
Local first.
And this is cost-conscious.
 
 
 
Any Twin Cities nesties?
 

There's at least one that I know but I won't out her. =)
We've got several in Seattle.
ETA: Dutch outed herself. There are a few others but I can't think of names offhand.
ETAA: Waves at Jenny from the block.
 
 
I believe I am having one tomorrow night :)
But 5280 is too scared to meet me.
 
 
:( I think I may truly be the only one in the Detroit area. Boo. I say, boo!
 
 
I am in for Seattle (shut up, miso).

The couple times ive met Internet friends irl went well. I'd love a couple more local buddies!
 
 
Pittsburgh has a pretty large GTG group from its local board, but I think only a couple of us are on MM.
An aside...I posted about the friends thing too back in Oct. I took MM's advice went to a Pgh GTG, started getting friendly on FB, and today I met a Pgh Bumpie for a playdate. I've been really putting myself out there with that, as well as my MOPs group, and I've been a ton happier!

Precisely.
I know a number of us get nervous or anxious. A lot of us are introverts. A lot of us are scared if people will like us.
But let's take a look at  my poll about whether people would be friends with me in real life . (There is a method to my madness, folks.)
Not everybody will want to be friends with you.
But don't you think it's worth it to meet 10 people with the chance of making seven friends? Five friends? Three friends? Even one friend?
I think so.
 
 
 
 
Should I come?
 

I would be nice to you. I promise.
I can't speak for Wan. LOL.

 

Yes - I've been wanting to meet you for a while hereonceagain! :)

What do you mean 'baby steps'? I organized a GTG years ago in a totally different city from where I lived and 10 people actually showed up.
I am ready for the big time.

I feel like the m is fit on the pgh board since I don't have kids. Maybe ill start posting the more. I live in the same neighborhood as one of the girls there.
 
 
There are plenty of us Philly area girls. We had a g2g a while ago, we should do it again.
 
 
No one knows who I am yet. Maybe next year :)
I really like this idea, though.

It's really died down over there in the last year and a half or so. And you're right, it's very kid heavy. I had a lovely time at the gtg though. I'll let you know when the next one is if you'd like.
 
 
I went to the last NYC GTG, but I was the only one who showed up. My MM GTG was just me and DD although we had a great time. I'd love to do a NYC GTG sometime. If any Cleveland area Nesties are around the beginning of April I will be there and would love to meet some of you. I'd also love to meet ijack and 5280 the next time I see my family in Denver, although I don't have any upcoming plans to go there.
 
 
 
KC could come up with a pretty sizable group. I've only met CJ but she was pretty great. I think there's at least 5 of us. It's about damn time we got our acts together!

 

I don't even know how many KC girls we have on here, I know there are quite a few.
I have hung out with pugz quite a bit IRL but we belong to another board that does a lot of GTGs and have become the majority of my IRL social circle.
A KC MM GTG does need to happen!!

Thank you! And sorry about the typos I'm on my iPad and painting my nails...
 
 
I do want to hang out with Dr. G and Beagle more. I think they are the only ones I talk to regularly in Philly. We did have a Philly gtg when I first moved here.
I've been to Dr. G's house, but that was about 2 years ago.
 
 
I would go to a Chicago/Chicago burbs GTG! But can we do this in about a year so I have time to lose more weight? I have NO IDEA why I am so self-conscious when meeting people. It's not like they need to sleep with me--they just need to sit there for an hour or so with me. But I am still consumed with angst.
 
 
 
:( I think I may truly be the only one in the Detroit area. Boo. I say, boo!
 

That's okay.
I think I'm the only S.FL Nestie on MM. I went to a local G2G from a couple years ago, but all of the girls in my area are on the Bump and in full baby mode. One of them handed me their baby and I just held it like "what do I do with this thing?" I've been leery ever since.

This was the beauty of my LA trip. Knocked out meeting a lot of people at once. Even H had fun.
 
 
I am laughing but in a non malicious way, I promise :) I personally love it when people dork out.
 
 
At the very least, I would love if Nesties in other cities could meet each other, even if we don't FaceTime or whatever.
I love my Internet friends so much that I hope that more of you can create similar lasting friendships.
 
 
I'd love a Chicago gtg. Our local board is dead and I was considering using meetup anyway when I move there ft this May
 
 
I used to meet anka at the gym and ice cream, but then I moved. Our kids would be married by now if I hadn't moved....
I think I've met most of the nashville nesties.
However mfluder and 5280 should visit me next time they are visiting relatives
 
 
Did someone mention lanyards? I am a sucker for that type of thing.
Maybe we should do a nationwide GTG in Vegas. There could be an awards ceremony with prizes for "Nest in Class"
I'm only partially kidding.

Aw, you are having a gtg? Who all is meeting up?!
 
 
I want to see the Denver girls when I'm there in May if it works out.
would love a KC gtg when I am feeling better and able to eat normally! It will be quite some time before Brie and I can drink :)

I feel like I've almost teased you too much to meet now, lol.
 
 
I'm about to jet soon, but this is my thought:
If you are willing to be the point person for your city, please volunteer in this thread. You will be responsible for collecting e-mail addresses for your city's Nesties and sending out details regarding the location of your city's GTG.
After each point person is determined, I will start another thread listing these contacts. People interested in attending will then PM their point person with e-mail addresses.
I'm thinking we can make this happen in late February.
Unless you think it could be done sooner.
(I say late February because I'll be in Europe during the first half. LOL.)
I volunteer to be point person for the Los Angeles area.
Talk amongst yourselves.

I'd love to meet you, Pugz.
 
 
I'll be the person for South Louisiana!
 
 
I'll be the person for Kansas City (other MO/KS girls as well if they want to come here)
 
 
 
 
Any Twin Cities nesties?
 

I believe there are a number of us. I'd attend a Twin Cities MM gtg.

 
Me too :)
I know of two more MM TC nesties who haven't replied yet.
 
 
I will be the point person for anyone in the NYC area willing to meet in Southern Connecticut or Westchester County, NY.

I am besties with a ML regular. :)

I pph my mm buddies. I've met some great people. I'm not aware not aware of any other upstate sc nestled, but is be glad to meet them if there are. or I could always crash the atl gtg.
 
 
I will be the point person for Atlanta--we are meeting up really soon, so excited. If I can't meet my Internet friends IRL, what's the point?

i am really looking forward to our gtg.
 
 
I'm in for the Philadelphia/SJ area.
 
 
 
 
I believe I am having one tomorrow night :)
But 5280 is too scared to meet me.

 

Aw, you are having a gtg? Who all is meeting up?!

 

It'a not really a gtg - just a gathering of people whom I met on the nest many, many years ago. Most don't even post anymore. Though I believe Ondrea will be there.
I would really like to meet you though :)
 
 
I'd be down for a Boston MMers gtg! I've already met Rock n Voll and Dr. Loretta through the Boston board. I've probably seen liveintheville around since I also live in the ville  
eta: I'd love to meet Amamba. We should do a join RI/MA gtg then Rikki could meet a whole bunch of new friends.
 
 
 
Any Twin Cities nesties?
 

YESSSSSS!
Where are you at? I am near NE Mpls. I am up for socializing.
 
 
 
I will be the point person for anyone in the NYC area willing to meet in Southern Connecticut or Westchester County, NY.

I am besties with a ML regular. :)

 

This sounds awesome! We could meet in White Plains.

I'm meeting 5280 this summer! Woot!
 
 
Cosmos & I went to the mall together a couple weeks ago.  
I'm down for a NNJ GTG, but I don't have time to run point on it.
 
 
I'll be the point person for Central Florida! LOL. Kwynn, let's GTG!
 
 
 
This sounds awesome! We could meet in White Plains.

 

Woot!

Text me again the next time you go to the museum. I am usually out and about on Saturdays. I feel bad we weren't able to link up last time, but really, feel free to shoot me a text if you're in town!

It's really died down over there in the last year and a half or so. And you're right, it's very kid heavy. I had a lovely time at the gtg though. I'll let you know when the next one is if you'd like.

 

Thank you! And sorry about the typos I'm on my iPad and painting my nails...

 

Well, there are at least 3 of us on MM... What area of town are you guys in? I'd love to meet up. I'd have to bring Nora probably, though... but I don't mind bringing babies to bars 'nat. ;)
 
 
 
DC Nesties. And, I am in for that get together, if you'll have me. I recently reached Bronze status!

 

I'm in! Although my status is still a newbie :(
 
 
 
I'll be the point person for Central Florida! LOL. Kwynn, let's GTG!

 

I can do Tampa or I can just crash the Central FL one :-P
FTR, I've organized many GTGs in lots of places in the last few years. I am dying to make it out to SoCal to meet a bunch of my fav MMers. Hopefully my August trip will happen and many are available. Woot.
 
 
 
I'd be down for a Boston MMers gtg! I've already met Rock n Voll and Dr. Loretta through the Boston board. I've probably seen liveintheville around since I also live in the ville

YES. We must do RI/MA. The area between Boston & Providence is probably smaller than the LA metro area :)
I propose that we do it somewhere in the middleish. But who wants to organize? I am actually super busy planning a baby shower for my sister and a bridal shower right now so I'm not sure that I have time, but if someone else wants to organize, I will gladly attend.

Most of us are FB friends now, so I think that's why the board's a lot slower. Now that I actually live close to Pittsburgh, I'd like to go to a GTG. We had one for the girls who live in the counties further south and it was a lot of fun.
 
 
Lol. sorry about my spelling. I'm not drunk, just on my phone and posting is a nightmare (and forget post editing)
 
 
Can I crash either the bay area or so cal gtg...unless anyone out there will admit that they live in the central valley.
 
 
 
I'll be the person for Kansas City (other MO/KS girls as well if they want to come here)
 

Woo! You have my e-mail.

I think there are at least 5 of us here that I can think of.
 
 
Longshot but if any regulars / semi-regulars are for Southwestern Ohio, I can be the point person for that. I think I have only seen one somewhat regular from this area...

I have no desire to meet the locals on the Pittsburgh board, but I'd meet you two.
ETA I'd meet the rest of the MMers, too. Didn't realize I missed so many. I live about an hour away, but I'll run point if no one else wants to :)

I'd be happy to take the reigns but I've taken such a long Nest break i'm not sure many people here even recognize me anymore  . Not sure what would be the halfway point...somewhere in the Canton to Mansfield stretch perhaps?
 
 
Oh man. I'd love to attend a GTG but I don't believe there are any MMers near me :(

Pittsburg is probably the closest to me, but it's still close to a 3 hour drive. Philly is even longer.
 
 
I think the last one I did was at my house. I bought everyone lunch ;-)!
 
 
 
 
I'll be the point person for Central Florida! LOL. Kwynn, let's GTG!

 

I can do Tampa or I can just crash the Central FL one :-P
FTR, I've organized many GTGs in lots of places in the last few years. I am dying to make it out to SoCal to meet a bunch of my fav MMers. Hopefully my August trip will happen and many are available. Woot.

 

This will probably be the closest one for me, lol. I've met (& vacationed with) internet friends from other sites, but haven't met any MM Nesties yet. I'm super excited about the possibility of meeting chocoholicchick & BB in a month & a half! :)
 
 
I've met ijack & ondrea At GTGs 4+ years ago. I don't go to gtg anymore...I met some nice people but after 3 i realized I just don't enjoy them. Which is weird because I'm very outgoing in normal circumstances. Funny story though...I am friend's with Annettah on FB & I saw 2 people I knew in one of her photos...She lives in ATL, one was a girl I was friend's with Fresh yr in HS in IL (1989) & another I know from church here in Denver....Talk about worlds colliding!
 
 
 
Longshot but if any regulars / semi-regulars are for Southwestern Ohio, I can be the point person for that. I think I have only seen one somewhat regular from this area...
 

I would be happy to drive down there (love me some Ikea) just as soon as my baby stops hating the car or starts taking a bottle.
Or the Cincinnati and Columbus people could meet halfway at the outlets, lol. Very MM!
 
 
 
 
On my anniversary board, we did a Chicago GTG last year. All of us from different states came together. It was a blast!!

 

This sounds fun! I stopped posting on 9/08, and I'm sad I missed this now.
I think NJ MMers have GTGs and I'm close enough that I would attend a NYC GTG. But I still don't post a lot and would feel like a stalker trying to attend one since I don't think anyone knows who I am.  

 

You should come back! There was an EC GTG in October some of the gals went to.
 
 
Oklahoma City? I like people too... *crickets*
 
 
 
 
 
I will be the point person for anyone in the NYC area willing to meet in Southern Connecticut or Westchester County, NY.

I am besties with a ML regular. :)

 

This sounds awesome! We could meet in White Plains.

 

But White Plains is like the Bermuda Triangle of Westchester. I always get lost.

 

There are a lot of cool restaurants on Mamroneck Ave in downtown WP which is pretty close to the highway as well as the train station. You'll be okay, I promise.   But, we could also go someplace else.
Sunrocks, I was actually at the museum today. We may go back next Friday. I renewed my membership so I'm pretty flexible. Hopefully we can finally get together sometime soon. :-)
 
 
I am willing to be the point person for Northern CA. If I am the only one, I am willing to travel to the LA/Southern CA area. I have a $100 credit on Southwest that I have to use up by June.

I would be up for driving down from Cbus. Who are the other OH girls? 6sfn is the only other I can think of right now. Starry, I'm pm you my email address  
 
 
 
 
I will be the point person for Atlanta--we are meeting up really soon, so excited. If I can't meet my Internet friends IRL, what's the point?

 
i am really looking forward to our gtg.
 

I know I've been on an extended Nest vacation, and Womet is possibly the only person on this board who actually knows who I am (both my former Nest name and who I am IRL), but if it wouldn't be too weird could I get the details on this GTG?? Womet, you could message me on FB. I would love to meet some of the ATL MMers!
 
 
 
 
I'll be the person for Kansas City (other MO/KS girls as well if they want to come here)
 

Woo! You have my e-mail.

I think there are at least 5 of us here that I can think of.

 

Can I crash it? I'm willing to drive south....
 
 
I would love a gtg, but I don't think there are any other MMers in my area. Bridey and Tosa are a couple hours away, but I don't post often, so they probably wouldn't want to meet  
 
 
 
Oklahoma City? I like people too... *crickets*
 

I'm in OKC and I think there's a few others. I'm pretty socially awkward and DH just told me a GTG is a horrible idea, but I wouldn't completely rule it out if a GTG was planned.
 
 
 
 
I'll be the point person for Central Florida! LOL. Kwynn, let's GTG!

I second either of you!
Choco tried to organize one for tomorrow, but I suck on following up.   What are you gonna do? I'd be in for this late February one!

Cool. I guess we can see how many more of us there are and go from there. I'm in Norman. Where are you at?
 
 
 
I'd be down for a Boston MMers gtg! I've already met Rock n Voll and Dr. Loretta through the Boston board. I've probably seen liveintheville around since I also live in the ville  
eta: I'd love to meet Amamba. We should do a join RI/MA gtg then Rikki could meet a whole bunch of new friends.

 

yes yes yes! Are you making yourself the point person SCM? ETA: Saw your response. I'm sure people remember you. I would volunteer to organize but I'm still getting my bearings.
 
 
I will be the Seattle captain.
Off the top of my head, we have me, Sugarnear, Catbus, Epphd, Nonny, MrsBPO, Alisha (she doesn't post much anymore but I think I still have her email and she's awesome) and I am sure many others that I am just blanking on.
Lurkers should come too! (Do you hear me, lurkers??)
 
 
 
 
 
I'll be the person for Kansas City (other MO/KS girls as well if they want to come here)

Sure, I'll volunteer. I'll post on Monday when there are more people around. I might ask for your advice on location options though B since you're in that general area!
 
 
 
Can I crash either the bay area or so cal gtg...unless anyone out there will admit that they live in the central valley.
 
I live in Bako...but I met the LA contingent once and have wanted to meet up again since because they are super nice...so we can car-pool...we need to get out if the valley every chance we get! Lol
 
 
 
I am in for Seattle (shut up, miso).

The couple times ive met Internet friends irl went well. I'd love a couple more local buddies!

 

Me too! (Why haven't we met yet?)
 
 
 
I would go to a Chicago/Chicago burbs GTG! But can we do this in about a year so I have time to lose more weight? I have NO IDEA why I am so self-conscious when meeting people. It's not like they need to sleep with me--they just need to sit there for an hour or so with me. But I am still consumed with angst.
 

Don't worry, there are other MM/Nest fatties out there! (Me included) LOL.
I'm in for a D.C. gtg. We have a fair number of local board GTGs. They're fun.
 
 
 
 
 
I'll be the point person for Central Florida! LOL. Kwynn, let's GTG!

I got to meet Epphd right before she moved west! I was bummed I wasn't going to see her at another GTG
 
 
Ooh do I do White plains or Philly?

Cant we merge the groups and meet up in new brunswick NJ? Plenty of trains....
 
 
 
Cosmos & I went to the mall together a couple weeks ago.  
I'm down for a NNJ GTG, but I don't have time to run point on it.

 
xoxo!! we need another date!

I'd love a Chicago gtg. Our local board is dead and I was considering using meetup anyway when I move there ft this May

 

Well, there's 3 of us! We have a local Chicago Facebook group with 13 ladies. We are hopefully going to have brunch coming up soon. One of the ladies just had a baby and then this snow hit.

On occasion I do...not so much now since his base is LAX, but sometimes DH catches flights to FAT because it gets a bit more traffic than BFL.
 
 
 
Sure, I'll volunteer. I'll post on Monday when there are more people around. I might ask for your advice on location options though B since you're in that general area!

 

I'd love to attend. I lurk more than post. Anka could vouch for me if she still posted. One of my bookcases is now in her sunroom.

Out of town LA GTG peeps, let me know if you need me to pick you up from the airport.

I don't post a lot, but I'm game for a Bay Area GTG.
Abvernon, if your location is current, I live very close to you.
 
 
 
I'm going to get all corny and sappy now, but I really value the friendships I've made on this board and others.

 

Miso, WTF is wrong with you? Did you fall down or something?  
 
 
 
I'll be the person for Kansas City (other MO/KS girls as well if they want to come here)
 

I am in Wichita but get to kc a few times a year. I'd love to hear about it when you decide when and where!

I'm in the Edmond area, but I'm pretty familiar with Norman. Let's see if Monday brings out some more people.
 
 
I'm sad there's not a strong Portland, OR presence. I know there are a few on MM, but I don't post much so I'm not sure anyone knows who I am. I'm interested in a GTG if anyone else is!
 
 
Flexie is the only Nestie I know of in my area, and I doubt she'd know me under this name....
Anchorage area, anyone?
 
 
 
I'm sad there's not a strong Portland, OR presence. I know there are a few on MM, but I don't post much so I'm not sure anyone knows who I am. I'm interested in a GTG if anyone else is!
 
Felicity is in PDX and she's awesome.
Maybe you guys could come up for a NW GTG??

Multiple personalities. LOL.
No, seriously, though, sometimes I get oddly emotional.
 
 
I don't think anyone lives by me... Anyone in Arizona?
 
 
I was just about to say AZ. One nestie lives in my hood I believe.
But I'm seriously awkward.  
 
 
muahahahahahahahahahaha.
IN for the l.a. area GTG. god, this will be so fun to blog.
 
 
 
I was just about to say AZ. One nestie lives in my hood I believe.
But I'm seriously awkward.  

 

Where in AZ? It's okay, I'm kind of awkward too, especially when I meet new people.
 
 
 
god, this will be so fun to blog.

 

LOL that this is your first thought! Man, I would love to crash a Cali GTG, NorCal or SoCal. I just don't get out there enough anymore.
Funny, I was in Chicago last week and I started a post to ask if any of the local Nesties wanted to GTG while I was in town but then I got scared no one would be interested, chickened out, and deleted the post  

SCM, Dr.L, you know I'm in for a Boston GTG! And I think combining with the RI girls is a fabulous idea!
 
 
North valley
 
 
 
 
 
Any Twin Cities nesties?
 

YESSSSSS!
Where are you at? I am near NE Mpls. I am up for socializing.

 

South Minneapolis! II'm so glad there are more TC nesties.

 

I'm in South Minneapolis too. I know Emilie is in the cities too, as is nsfw, I think.
 
 
I'm in west valley(closer to Avondale/Goodyear). We could probably find somewhere in between if you are up for a GTG.
 
 
 
 
I'm sad there's not a strong Portland, OR presence. I know there are a few on MM, but I don't post much so I'm not sure anyone knows who I am. I'm interested in a GTG if anyone else is!

No one for Iowa?
I'm eastern Iowa but would be willing to travel to Des Moines area. I know there are a few nesties there and I think there are at least a couple of you who are closer but you don't post as much (or at least not about the fact you are close to me) so names escape me.
I'm jealous of all of you who are closer together. I'll be in Chicago and probably San Diego (or maybe Atlanta instead?) at points this year too.... but I want local friends especially!
 
 
 
 
 
Ooh do I do White plains or Philly?

I'm down for a NNJ GTG, but I don't have time to run point on it.

 
Omg how am I just now realizing that this is you. I thought you just didn't post on MM anymore. Lol, duh!

If you can bring me a few containers of Anderson Erickson Old Fashioned cottage cheese when you come to San Diego I will totally be your friend!
I know there are a few SD girls on here but for some reason SD girls are a bit flaky. I've met IAmAli and PitaBread but everyone else has either vanished or turned into a bumpie.

I really only lurk on MM, but if I was going to be around I'd so be on board with you guys!! Nuts!!
 
 
Chicken and Jigs, I grew up in Visalia. I'd totally be on board if I still lived there. I joke that I married to get out of there and so my kids could have ex's blue eyes. Got one but not the other. (Navy guy out of Lemoore. I saw the world, just like they promised. Lemoore and Washington state.)
I used to go to GTGs in Cleveland and met a lot of people I really like and admire. I still keep in touch with some of them, which is so not me. I'm a horrible correspondent. And I've been to a few Seattle GTGs (including a couple with Flexie) and was even in a book club with Nonny for a few months back in the day. (She is now thinking "OMG, I remember her! I am so not going to any GTG now!") I always had fun meeting the folks face-to-face.
Jenny, I'll PM you or we can friend on Facebook which might be easier since I'm about 1,000 behind on my emails right now. I am looking forward to meeting at least some of the contingent because Seattle has some of the coolest Nesties. And absolutely get Alisha on board. I miss her posts and her Danes.
 
 
Jenny1980 said Seattle lurkers to come out..so here I am.
I'm also from AK and home at least 4 or 5 times a year, I could never find anyone from there on the boards back when I lived there.
 
 
 
I'm sad there's not a strong Portland, OR presence. I know there are a few on MM, but I don't post much so I'm not sure anyone knows who I am. I'm interested in a GTG if anyone else is!
 

They all lurk on this board : )
We GTG about once a month or so, you are more than welcome to join us! Send me a PM if you read this!

I know who you are and I'm pretty sure you are in at least one of my old book club GTG photos. That book kept disbanding and re-assembling and disbanding again, but it was fun while it lasted. I'm still good friends with several former members. :)
 
 
I'm pretty sure no one on here lives near me  . Shoot I would even drive up to Richmond, but I don't think anyone from there posts anymore.
Maybe I'll just crash the DC gtg.

Count me in for the DC GTG.
 
 
 
 
I will be the point person for anyone in the NYC area willing to meet in Southern Connecticut or Westchester County, NY.

I am besties with a ML regular. :)

 

This sounds awesome! We could meet in White Plains.

 

Awesome! White Plains is really close to me!
 
 
I'm up for a NJ / Philly GTG. I don't post much, but I'm on here way more than I'd like to admit and it would be nice to meet people in person.
 
 
I'm down for the next ATL GTG if they mutually decide they aren't crazy at the initial GTG. :-P
 
 
I'm. A semi lurker but totally in for Seattle.
 
 
No Houston nasties? I know they do GTGs their own but I can't maintain another nest board presence I barely have one on MM.

Any Houston nestles interested?
 
 
 
No one for Iowa?

 

I'm here!
And a certain new mommy is from DM too, but I don't think she has her location listed so I won't out her.
And there's another fairly regular poster from DM too; she's been pretty busy lately so I don't think she's been on as much.

There are lots of Des Moines nesties, but most of them post on the local board. I think they only pop over here when they have a MM question.
I can never remember - are you from IC area?
 
 
Is anyone else from St. Louis?
 
 
 
I'm pretty sure no one on here lives near me  . Shoot I would even drive up to Richmond, but I don't think anyone from there posts anymore.
Maybe I'll just crash the DC gtg.

 

i'm in roanoke--- where are you???
 
 
Count me in for the Ohio GTG. Ms. Starry, you have mail.
 
 
 
I'm pretty sure no one on here lives near me  . Shoot I would even drive up to Richmond, but I don't think anyone from there posts anymore.

Drive UP to Richmond? Where are you in VA? I went to 1 DC GTG but it was mostly P&CE. Choco planned it. I am always in for a DC GTG.
 
 
 
 
 
Sure, I'll volunteer. I'll post on Monday when there are more people around. I might ask for your advice on location options though B since you're in that general area!

Seattle is going to OWN this thing (it's a competition, right? LOL).
 
 
 
 
No one for Iowa?

 

I'm here!
And a certain new mommy is from DM too, but I don't think she has her location listed so I won't out her.
And there's another fairly regular poster from DM too; she's been pretty busy lately so I don't think she's been on as much.

There are lots of Des Moines nesties, but most of them post on the local board. I think they only pop over here when they have a MM question.
I can never remember - are you from IC area?

 

Yep, close to IC!
I can think of at least 2 other nesties aside from you that I know are in DM but I'm not sure who the one is that you hinted at. Neither of the ones I'm thinking of recently had a baby (unless it is a secret baby, haha).
I know there is another nestie who lives within 30 minutes or so from here, and I'm pretty sure another lives somewhat close but it is not confirmed. Hmm. We're a little spread out but it would be fun to meet up sometime. We may not want to plan on February though since driving all over Iowa in Feb can be pretty scary!
 
 
 
KC could come up with a pretty sizable group. I've only met CJ but she was pretty great. I think there's at least 5 of us. It's about damn time we got our acts together!

 

If it's a weekend I would make the drive if at all possible.

I think LA wins by a mile.
 
 
There's been talk of an Albany gtg. It will happen one of these days I hope. There's only three of us though. Anyone else I don't know about?
 
 
 
I will be the Seattle captain.
Off the top of my head, we have me, Sugarnear, Catbus, Epphd, Nonny, MrsBPO, Alisha (she doesn't post much anymore but I think I still have her email and she's awesome) and I am sure many others that I am just blanking on.
Lurkers should come too! (Do you hear me, lurkers??)

 

I'm a lurker from Seattle and would love to go!
 
 
 
 
I'm pretty sure no one on here lives near me  . Shoot I would even drive up to Richmond, but I don't think anyone from there posts anymore.
Maybe I'll just crash the DC gtg.

 

i'm in roanoke--- where are you???

 

Hampton roads
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oklahoma City? I like people too... *crickets*
 

I'm in OKC and I think there's a few others. I'm pretty socially awkward and DH just told me a GTG is a horrible idea, but I wouldn't completely rule it out if a GTG was planned.

 
Cool. I guess we can see how many more of us there are and go from there. I'm in Norman. Where are you at?
 

I'm in the Edmond area, but I'm pretty familiar with Norman. Let's see if Monday brings out some more people.

 

I'm in NW OKC, and I know at least 2 other OKC area people sometimes post on MM.
Socially awkward could also be used to describe me.   I say we meet.
 
 
 
Chicken and Jigs, I grew up in Visalia. I'd totally be on board if I still lived there. I joke that I married to get out of there and so my kids could have ex's blue eyes. Got one but not the other. (Navy guy out of Lemoore. I saw the world, just like they promised. Lemoore and Washington state.)

 

I grew up in Lemoore, and my grandmother lived in Visalia. Small world.

I'm eastern Iowa but would be willing to travel to Des Moines area. I know there are a few nesties there and I think there are at least a couple of you who are closer but you don't post as much (or at least not about the fact you are close to me) so names escape me.
I'm jealous of all of you who are closer together. I'll be in Chicago and probably San Diego (or maybe Atlanta instead?) at points this year too.... but I want local friends especially!

 

My parents live in Ames, and I come down probably monthly. But realistically, we are only there for 2 days and it is always crazy busy, and I probably wouldnt have time :(
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any Twin Cities nesties?
 
YESSSSSS!Where are you at? I am near NE Mpls. I am up for socializing.
 
South Minneapolis! II'm so glad there are more TC nesties.
 
I'm in South Minneapolis too. I know Emilie is in the cities too, as is nsfw, I think.
 
I am in St. Paul and would probably be up for a GTG
 

Who wants to be in charge of the twin cities? I can, but I will first admit that I am kind of bad at organizing things.

I am also in Roanoke.

 

awesome, i really thought i was the only one! i know there are a couple others in the general vicinity (NRV, lynchburg...)
 
 
 
I have a CLE gtg photo that includes you from 2005! :)

 

I probably have the same photo. (And just another "small world" - Dutch and I used to work in the same building in Cleve. We used to bump into each other in the elevator or the downstairs market often.) =)
Dr. Loretta - very small world. I didn't know anyone admitted to living in Lemoore. I hopped onto the adopt board a few times when DH and I were considering and was glad to see your family grow. She's so adorable.

My permanent residence is just north of DSM, but I'm living in Kansas for an internship. I'll be in Iowa while I'm on maternity leave though...

A&S just had a baby; not a secret at all as she just announced his arrival this week.
The other is on now, talking politics.
I have no idea who you are thinking of!
Did you guys get a bunch of snow this weekend? We got a dusting is all. I'm almost scared for what February will bring since it didn't drop to winter temps until last week and even then it's not really been that low.
 
 
Dude, I'm realizing that I can totally be a MM GTG ho - I can hit up the KC one AND one in DM if it happens. Holla.

LOL now I feel kind of like a jerk. I knew A&S was in IA although for some reason I didn't think she was from DM so I wasn't even thinking of her. DUH. For some reason I thought her location was in her profile so I thought it must be someone else you were talking about. Clearly I'm not good at tracking such things.
I know who the politics person is and I was thinking of her as one of the other two.
The other person hasn't been posting much lately (that I have noticed) but she's also in DM.
I'd love to meet you all. SarahLindsay by DM do you mean Des Moines? We need to have a GTG for those near/in DM. There are tons of awesome nesties all over the county I'd love to meet so it would be a shame if we couldn't even get together the ones who are less than 2 hours away.

I'm in Des Moines - and I haven't been posting as much (the Nest is blocked at work   ). I would totally be up for it! But I also want to meet some of the Omaha/KCians!

You were the other person I was thinking of :o) I wasn't sure if you had your location in your profile either so I didn't want to say.

Sarahlindsay and I are in Omaha, and ChilliRellenos is a couple hours west of us. Smiles4ya is about an hour south of us (though she doesn't post here as much)

Hmm - Is Omaha about 2 hours from DM? If so we should all meet in DM. I think Omaha is a little far for me to travel (it would be 4 hours or so from my understanding) but we could all meet in the middle...

Depending on how fast you drive.   I think I've made it in roughly 2hrs. For SL and I, that would probably be fine. CR is west of us....though she hasn't chimed in, so I am just making assumptions on whether or not she'd even *want* to go!

I just wanted to be the 200th comment. Yeah me! and Yeah for meeting nesties! I hope to meet new people, and I do actually hope to develop friendships like Miso talks about...I think it is actually pretty cool.

Jump in the car, sista!  
 
 
Now I feel like a jerk too. I totally knew EJ was from here. And I thought mishy was too, but I knew she had referenced another place too so I wan't sure. Sarahlindsay - I had no idea!
I wouldn't mind helping plan something for the area, but I admittedly don't know a lot about it. And for your out-of-towners, I could probably hook up up with a discounted room, depending on when we are doing this.
 
 
Sept508, I sent you a PM with my contact info for the DM GTG. I don't know if I'll be able to make it but I would love to meet you all!
 
 
LibGrl, I'm in the Detroit metro area. I think LacieMI and mackislandbride live one town away from me, and PreciesMom is a few blocks from me. But I haven't seen them post in a while. Maybe they mostly lurk like I do?
I'll send you a PM. Maybe you'll see that before this =)
 
 
 
 
 
I'm sad there's not a strong Portland, OR presence. I know there are a few on MM, but I don't post much so I'm not sure anyone knows who I am. I'm interested in a GTG if anyone else is!
 
Felicity is in PDX and she's awesome.
Maybe you guys could come up for a NW GTG??

 

 

 

Another Portlander here. Raises hand. :)
