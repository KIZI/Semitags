The ex-rebels of southern Sudan have chosen Yassir Arman, a secular Muslim from
North Sudan, to contest Omar el-Bashir in the April presidential election, the
first multi-party ballot since 1986 in Sudan.

"The political bureau have unanimously picked comrade Yassir Said Arman as SPLM
presidential candidate for the republic of Sudan," Pagan Amum, the Sudan
People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) secretary general told AFP in the early
hours of Friday morning, following marathon talks that began Thursday afternoon.
