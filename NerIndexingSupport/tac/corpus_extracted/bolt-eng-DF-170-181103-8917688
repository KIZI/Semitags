News: U.S.F.S.R.
Monday, Jun. 14, 1943

U.S.F.S.R. In London 60 years ago, when he was red-bearded and in his 20s, George Bernard Shaw joined the newly founded Fabian Society.† It was a socialist group, ambitious to reconstruct "society in accordance with the highest moral possibilities.

" The Fabians rejected the Marxian doctrine that socialism must be preceded by revolution. They believed in "gradualism," holding that the socialist principle was partially embodied in most governments and capable of extension through existing political parties.

Last week, a bit nostalgically, with the old flashing wit, venerable G.B.S. relived those early days—and almost forgot that he was reviewing G. D. H. Cole's Fabian Socialism for the London Tribune:
"This Fabian Society seemed just what I wanted.... We began by imposing on the Liberal Party... a socialist program.... We... founded the London School of Economics, which has produced Beveridge; added The New Statesman to the weekly press; established an independent labour party....
"In the course of nature, we young upstarts became an Old Gang.... Of the seven Fabian essayists of the '80s the only survivors are [Sidney] Webb and myself, both octogenarians.... Be patient with us: we shall not be long now...."

The Fabian Society had really been founded 62 years ago, but, because of the war, it delayed the celebration. The postponement was in character; Fabius Cunctator (The Delayer) had worn out Hannibal in the Second Punic War* by what Livy called "masterly inactivity."

The earnest young men & women of the 1880s who believed that socialism (not the Marxist brand) would come with what Webb called the "inevitability of gradualness" took Fabius as their exemplar.
They considered violent revolution unnecessary, believed their Utopia could be achieved by "permeating" existing institutions.

Will a national debt of $300,000,000,000 bankrupt the U.S.? Where will the money to finance postwar full employment come from? How can jobs be found for 12,000,000 returning soldiers & sailors?

So who are todays Fabian society ?
 
 
By 1946 the Fabians were constitutionally wedded to the British Treasury. Nearly every member of the present Government was either a member of the Fabian Society or had been consciously influenced by it. Webb, now 87, had long ago (1929) overcome his aversion to titles of nobility and reluctantly consented to become Baron Passfield (though the late Beatrice refused to become Lady Passfield). But Shaw, looking for new worlds to conquer, at 90, sent the meeting a telegram:

"The only message I have for the moment is that the Fabian Society, having made Russia a great Fabian state, has now to make Henry Wallace succeed Franklin Roosevelt as President of the United States."

Never liked Fabian

 

Now....Dion kicked ass!

 
 
 
 
" The Fabians rejected the Marxian doctrine that socialism must be preceded by revolution.

 

that isn't what Marx said, and he lived in London and spoke good English so the Fabians should have known better.

Marx said that socialism would emerge via revolution in Russia but would evolve thru peaceful social revolution in France and Britain.

And he was spot on in both cases.

Or, you could just cut to the chase and   go here. 
 
 
While some like the Dude may have swooned over Fabian, I preferred Dion and Bobby Darin. Their sound was more cutting edge and they had less of a manufactured personna

Of course...there was always Frankie Vally

Are you talking about Al Linsky the Polka King of the midwest?

 

I believe he invented the Chicken Dance but he did not have the voice of Fabian or Dion
 
 
Id say you are a sewer dweller, rather than a sewer worker.

I am not sure what response you anticipated but socialism is as credible a political religion as capitalism or any variety of limited democracy you could think up.

That a society existed to promote socialism is self evident. Even if the Fabians had never existed.

So?

Was there a deeper point?
 
 
Id say the "inevitability of gradualness" is now bearing its fruit.

cool, but your family, society itself and the vast majority of tribal clans from which we ascended were all socialist. For millions of years.

If anything it is the gradualness of monarchy, capitalism and elitism that is in evidence. All of which are brand new, untested innovations yet to prove themselves.

But I don't suppose the impact of those facts will resonate inside your partisan skull cavity.
 
 
Thats an interesting take on things.I can do with out the denigrating remarks in the future,
 
 
 
Id say the "inevitability of gradualness" is now bearing its fruit.

 

So your point is that over time people will think Fabian is a great singer and flock to him? I doubt it. Fabian has a limited fan base and it has not expanded over the last 50 years
 
 
Who knew so many people worshipped Fabian! Kinda scary!  

 

I'm sorry people. I just had to!  
 
 
 
Thats an interesting take on things.I can do with out the denigrating remarks in the future,

 

OK, I apologize.

So let's go there.

The Fabian society set as it's original goals the achievement of real socialism, not social democracy.

Real socialism is the government ownership of the means of production usually defined as about 40% government ownership in those means. That is a very specific definition which has nothing to do with the wealth redistribution schemes and Nanny state architecture of social democracy.

Maybe the Fabians drifted after their founding, I dunno.

But their original goal would include things like the government owning the land, or a return to feudalism, and the factories of that time.

But it wouldn't include things the government owning the banks, schools, roads, and lotsa other things that are not means of production.

So my question is, what is it about socialism and social democracy that you so object to?

Thanks Ill make it up to you.
From the things that well known fabians have said in the past I dont think what they were going after was traditional socialism.
Shaw was a eugenicist and called himself a Christian socialist who wished to rid the world of inequality.
He prayed for a gas to use as a human way to rid the world of useless people Zyclon B was the answer.
 The Fabian society :its early early history Ibid 
Id say that the "untested innovations "of capitalism has created more freedom and liberty that all that came before it.
Im an advocate for smaller efficient constitutional government.
I dont like the nepotism and corruption we have now with a ruling class.

I dont think the government should be in the business of equal stuff, just equal protection under the law.

Fabian the Singer is a metaphor for the Fabian Socialists
Fabian the singer was popular 50 years ago but never gained lasting fame. The Fabian Socialists were popular 50 years ago but neer saw a lasting rise in socialism

To claim that the Fabians somehow hae relevance today is the same as claiming that Fabian the singer is relevant today

Well they were in the beginning, in the late 19th century.

Henry Ford, most of the robber baron Barrons, Prescott Bush and even planned parenthood were all into this same shit back in the 20s and 30s. Even feminsists were eugenicists in that era.

Capitalism may not have created any freedom at all, and democracy is usually credited with the freedoms of which you speak. While progressivism brought us an end to child labor, the weekend, overtime pay, vacations, safer workplaces etc.

Capitalism was alive and well under the monarchy from which our forefathers rebelled. They still rebelled. Citing a distinct lack of freedom. Also citing a distinct aversion to crony capitalism.

But my question is about socialism. And I do not intend to argue per se, I am just interested in what exactly you object to about socialism or more likely social democracy.
 
 
I agree the progressives did some very good things they always go over board.
Im not a big fan of welfare states and government dependency.
The bigger they get the less I like them, despite some of the benefits seen in poverty levels.
To big to fail ?
I see it as squandering the future at the expense the next generation.
Right now we are spending about 17% on "welfare" and we are borrowing money to do that.
When the bill comes due?
What do we end up with a global government and a ruling elite ?

Representative republic not democracy.

Good night.

This is to much.

And really scraping the bottom.
 
 
 You Tube 
  You Tube

Not directed at me but I oppose the violence and oppression that democracy socialism and social democracy implies by it's very nature.

You don't like the job choice and income of your neighbor? Get a majority (democracy) and threaten to imprison or kill him (government courts and enforcement) if he does not give you a portion determined by you to be fair (taxation). (This applies to every person who supports taxation, not just socialists).

The very nature of democracy is control. It is neither peaceful, nor desirable. Democracy is not freedom. It makes neighbors enemies, and friendly people violent rivals. It turns an average person into a thieving control freak through the privacy of a ballot box. It gives a "voice" to the majority (which is what the few elites who benefit want), most of whom have no understanding of the nature of government and humanity.

People make democracy a god, but democracy is nothing more than a demonstration of the limits of human knowledge and futility of striving for worldly perfection.
 
 
Ugh.

Orwell was right.

noted that all of your beef is with the democracy aspects of social democracy. If anything I think this is a very important point. That democracy can evolve into a bidding war for electoral support wherein politicians make promises that their nations can't keep.

You pretty much made my point. It seems to me as if Socialism as a governmental form is so far out of circulation that nobody should take it seriously.

Meanwhile social democracy is red hot.

You appear to be adverse to democracy and esp concentrated democratic power.

I suspect you have many reasons for this and some are likely valid and others imagined.

Rather than rail endlessly about "socialism" maybe we could talk about the specifics of what you do and don't want.

Esp since what you describe will probably have nothing at all to do with socialism.

 Democracy Is Not Freedom 
 
 
Freedom is a concept that is only afforded by the voluntary relinquishment of violence. Once it becomes clear that there is no social contract, violence will fill that void again.
 
 
 
Once it becomes clear that there is no social contract,

 

Amen
 
 
 
 
Once it becomes clear that there is no social contract,

Wish the statists would understand that their violent actions are not justifiable under said contact and are nothing more than brute force.

the statists assume a social contract is enacted as soon as a parent enrolls a newborn for a SS #. And no act of God can revoke the assignment of that #. Not even death.

Of course that is a rhetorical question beings that this regime shits on it all the time.

You must've went to public school... so you have a pass on it.
 
 
being a social democracy is independent of what a constitution says.

I don't believe that any of the 30 or so social democracies are defined as such in their founding documents. Just like the Federal Republic of Germany wasn't described as a totalitarian fascist state by it's constitution in the 30's.
 
 
 
All this talk of socialism and democracy... lets not forget we are a CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC, not a demacracy.

 

The United States is a hybrid of both a Republic and a Democracy. As a Constitutional Republic, we have Constitutional checks and balances in place as protection from the tyranny of the majority. As a Representative Democracy, elected officials represent the people, also pursuant to Constitutional law.

You can call it a Doorknob for all I care, but it still comes out the same.

Sure. Conspiracy theories.

If you think we are living in a "statist" society, the gubmit would have confiscated, by force, the trillions in cash businesses are currently hoarding instead of investing in their businesses so they could start hiring again.

Wanna try again?

Good grief, you morons are looking for wars where none exist.

They don't have to do that when they can jut print up the money. Then they can steal the value of the money on the sidelines, by inflating its value away.

That's not a conspiracy, it's business as usual.

Social democracy is a political ideology of the centre-left on the classic political spectrum. The contemporary social democratic movement seeks to reform capitalism to align it with the ethical ideals of social justice while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, as opposed to creating an alternative socialist economic system.[1] Practical modern social democratic policies include the promotion of a welfare state, and the creation of economic democracy as a means to secure workers' rights.[

 Social democracy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 
Many of the policies espoused by social democrats in the first half of the 20th century have since been put into practice by social democratic governments throughout the industrialized world. Industries have been nationalized, public spending has seen a large long-term rise, and the role of the state in providing free-to-user or subsidized health care and education has increased greatly. Many of the reforms made by social democrats in Europe, such as the establishment of national health care services, have been embraced by liberals and conservatives, and there is no support outside of a radical fringe for a return to 19th-century levels of public spending and economic regulation. Even in the United States, where no major social democratic party exists, there are regulatory programmes (such as public health and environmental protection) and welfare programmes (such as Medicare[18] and Medicaid[19]) which enjoy bipartisan support.

State monopoly on use of force

 State monopoly on use of force - Google Search 

 
The monopoly on violence (German: Gewaltmonopol des Staates) is the definition of the state expounded by Max Weber in Politics as a Vocation, which has been predominant in philosophy of law and political philosophy in the twentieth century.

It defines a single entity, the state, exercising authority on violence over a given territory, as territory was also deemed by Weber to be a characteristic of state. Importantly, such a monopoly must occur via a process of legitimation, wherein a claim is laid to legitimise the state's use of violence.

 

 Monopoly on violence - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

BTW the implied legitimacy of a state's monopoly on the use of force is what makes cold blooded murder in war legal while the same acts in other contexts are illegal. It also is the basis for our police using force, arresting, trying, convicting and even executing criminals.
 
 
 
Sure. Conspiracy theories.

If you think we are living in a "statist" society, the gubmit would have confiscated, by force, the trillions in cash businesses are currently hoarding instead of investing in their businesses so they could start hiring again.

Wanna try again?

Good grief, you morons are looking for wars where none exist.

 

The government turns to China and a printing press to get their money.

All it eventually does is devalue the dollar through inflation so they end up stealing from us anyway.
 
 
 
 
 
do you know what a "social contract" is? Do you know what a "statist" is? Do you understand the concept of "state monopoly on force", or violence?

 

Sure. Conspiracy theories.

totally wrong.

Neither the definition of "statists", "social contract" or "state monopoly on use of force" mean anything you imagine.

They are all generic mainstream ideas that any government official would immediately cop to.

Sorry.

 

I still think you're attempting to make mountains out of molehills by taking someone's theory and presuming it's already in practice on a large scale as being something "evil."
 
 
 
Like you have any idea how the Fed's funny money monetary system works (mostly in favor of those eeeeevvviillll Wall Street bankseters, BTW) in the first place.  

 

I know how it works, and I know that the major banks play the primary role, goofball. So what's your brilliant solution? Trade beaver hides for a shank of hog for dinner?

Your solutions? How do you suppose our overall economy would be affected if we suddenly told China to go fuck itself and we stopped importing everything WalMart sells (WalMart being the number one EMPLOYER in the United States, for starters)? What would happen then when China would demand immediate payment on all the T-bonds it holds? Where would THAT money come from?

Playing the coulda/woulda/shoulda game doesn't solve the problem.

again you are arguing with your own phantoms.

All Oddball was asserting was that we do indeed have a statist federal government. again for clarity:

 
stat·ism (sttzm)
n.
The practice or doctrine of giving a centralized government control over economic planning and policy.

 

 statist - definition of statist by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. 

Who can deny that the USA does this and on a scale that is expanding rapidly since the recession began? Even the RW thinks that the federal government should take a role in controlling the economy using stimulative tax policy. And they have been beating that drum since Reagan.

Playing the coulda/woulda/shoulda game doesn't solve the problem.

 

Solutions? How about a balanced budget so we don't have to borrow money from China all the time.

What happens if China demands immediate payment? Interest rates go up drastically and the US dollar gets devalued greatly.

At some point we're going to have to go through hard times to make up for all the careless decades of horrible monetary policy.
 
 
 
 
 
we are a social democracy.

 

Wrong.... if that is so, then why do we have a Constituion, and representatives?

Of course that is a rhetorical question beings that this regime shits on it all the time.

You must've went to public school... so you have a pass on it.

 

And what kind of 'school' didn't teach you?

 

I went to private school.... and I have also, for the last 24 years been educating MYSELF, is there a problem with me being right?

We are technically a Representative Republic. We have a Constituion that protects our rights as a people from of all things.... "the government".
The Constitution is there to let the gov't know just how much power they have over us "the people". This is Obamas problem with it it is limited too much for his liking.

In an interview back in 2001 Obama said the U.S. has suffered from a fundamentally flawed Constitution that does not mandate or allow for redistribution of wealth.

 Obama rips U.S. Constitution 

All this talk of being a "social democracy" is a bunch of "hooie".

The gov't is not here to take care of our every need. We are supposed to take care of ourselves and our neighbors, and our community.
When you take a "hand-out", and thats what it is, you are obligated to the entity doing the handing out. (which is why if you are on the gov't tit, you should'nt get to vote - IMHO)

If we were a democracy then it would be mob rules like every other banana republic and thats what you guys want for here?

Sorry, but not in my America go make your own somewhere else.

Hell, go move down south see how far you get with that endeavor.

yet you assumed that I was "taking someone's theory", "presuming", "making mountains" and seeing "evil".

None of which was true, all of which you imagined, while yourself acknowledge you didn't have a clue what the discussion was about...

amazing!
