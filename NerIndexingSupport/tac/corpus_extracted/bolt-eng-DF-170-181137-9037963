That's right, just one game, but beat you and that's all that mattered!

Dont worry Janeen..we play again!!
 
 
Hey one of the better games this year. It was a thriller to the end and " Shocky " don't call the tuna a homo anymore. ha ha
 
 
HOMO, that was great!  
 
 
Sorry... I'm a huge Texans fan, being from Houston orignally. And even though we'll lose 10 games or so this year, I'll STILL root for them - the mark of a true fan!
