 
 
Is Israel so bad?
 
 
I wont pretend Israel is perfect, they have done contriversal things, but why is it that Russia is not condemed for killing 160,000 chechniyans Sudan is not condmed for the killing of 400,000 ethnics.

Infact at any one time there are 50-100 wars going on with an esitmated death per minute.

Why is it that only Israel whos conflict with Palestinians is much smaller, is the only country crtisized and why is it that people seem to forget that these terrorists who flat out say they want to destroy Israel that apprntly Israle is expected to ignore have killed over 1000 Isralei civilians in the last decade? As if Israel is just going out there to kill Palestinians.
 
 
I think saying that Sudan is not condemned... well, it's not entirely true, is it?
 
 
How many people have a sig proclaiming how their god is going to free Sudan?

1. Because the war is one of religion, unlike some wars - some would call it one of occupation, but the truth is that if Jews were Muslims far fewer Muslims would give a ****.

2. Because people expect more from a democratic "western" country than they do from a rin-tin-tinpot state like Myanmar or The Sudan.

3. Because the US, UK, and other places that people "love to hate" in this world, have been directly involved in supporting Israel.

To name a few.
 
 
Because Israel prides itself on Western values, and "morality". But has no qualms about IDF snipering little girls through the head in schools. It's the hypocrisy that gets to people.
 
 
Most people in the world are hypocrites. No way is that why people don't like Israel.

While that's true, I'd say that in perspective to the threat it's under it's not that much different. I mean, America gets attacked only once and goes gallivanting around the world, throwing people in Gitmo etc. Personally I believe it's down to race, and that people in the west by-and-large are less interested in something happening in Africa, just as they cared more about the white war in Yugoslavia than anything happening in Africa at the same time.

Um, the U.S was not just attacked "only once", it's just that Sept. 11th was the most prominent. Go on, do some basic research.

Erm i'd have to say that's one of the big things i've got against Israel. The way they go on about being the only democracy in the Middle East but then treat the Palestinians with complete disregard like they have no dignity whatsoever- the curfews, checkpoints etc. I also don't like the emphasis on the army in that country. However i should add that i am probably strongly influenced by my Jewish friends' grandparents who think Israel goes against Jewish religious principles. I must admit, that Israel is one of the most hated nations in the world deeply saddens me because jewish people are some of my most favourite in the world.

If you remove the word democracy, you've summed up half the continent.
 
 
But it is completely bizarre to say it is because they are hypocritical that people don't like Israel. Otherwise, people wouldn't dislike their actions so long as they didn't claim to take the moral high ground... If you believe Israel do wrong, take issue with them doing wrong, not how their doing wrong conflicts with some other part of their culture or political ideology. See my point?
 
 
It's also their disregard for anyone outside Israel. While some Israelis near the border have huge mansions and swimming pools ( ! ), next door Palestinians don't even have enough water to live.
 
 
In answer to the title of the thread: no.
 
 
What about the neighbouring Arab countries? You know, the ones who condemn Israel (when they aren't attacking it), call for the freedom of their Muslim brothers, own over 99% of the middle east, and yet don't actually offer them help?
 
 
They do. Iran recently gave a million dollars or so to Hamas. Not something I agree with, but the general feeling in the ME is that Israel simply is welcome if it's going to keep expanding settlement-by-settlement, usurping land for Jews only.
 
 
It's questionable as to whether giving money to Hamas is actually helping the Palestinians. More relevant are the severe restrictions on the rights of Palestinian immigrants in most neighbouring Arab countries, which are intended to intended to prevent "dilution of their sense of nationhood" or similar.

A million dollars? Wow, that'll solve the 'refugee crisis'.

If anything, it is the anti-Israel sentiment that is hypocritical, especially combined with pro-palestinian or pro-Muslim views.
 
 
Why should Arab countries even have to take on the inevitable burden of refugees ? They should return to their areas, which unfortunately have been turned into illegal Israeli settlements.
 
 
I guess I was wrong, I thought you had some historical knowledge of the situation.
 
 
What a pointless comment. I can't debate you because you keep going around in circles.

"They should go home...to other Arab countries."
 
 
Don't put words in my mouth. I pointed out that the Arabs are hypocritical for painting this picture that the Palestinians are poor helpless victims of the evil israelis, yet do nothing to help them themselves. They call upon Muslims worldwide to back the cause, yet treat them like dirt. If you can't see what a pawn the Palestinians are in this war of propaganda, there isn't much help. Iran et al don't want to give direct support to the Palestinians because they don't really give a crap about them - but the struggle of those living in the occupied areas helps their own causes. THEY are the hypocrites.
 
 
Fair enough, your opinion. But irrelevant to this thread. Arab countries treating Palestinians "like dirt" doesn't paint a picture of why they are refugees in the first place. They are refugees because Israeli forces demolished their homes to make room for Israeli settlements. Fact.
 
 
I don't deny that. I think the Arabs are hypocrites aswell and many of the governments stoke up tensions against Israel to divert attention from theemselves. A lot of the time i think what they do has negative effects on the peace process. However that does not excuse Israel.

Oh right, cos that is the beginning of history? Nothing happened before that? They were living in harmony until Israel decided to expel all the Arabs? This is why I suspect you know nothing of the history. And it is not irrelevant as it is an answer to the claim that hypocrisy is the reason people think of Israel as being bad. It must be more, or something else entirely, or else we would not single out Israel. It is also a possible explanation for why israel is indeed singled out - because of the role it plays in Middle East propaganda.
 
 
All you've done is say well the Arabs are hypocrites too. That doesn't change the fact that Israel has, and still is, illegally removing Palestinian settlements and replacing them with Jewish ones.
 
 
May I suggest two articles for you invocation..

The Settlement Myth
 http://www.israelinsider.com/views/a...views_0056.htm 
(Originally in Boston Globe now at the Link above)

and
What Occupation/
 http://www.palestinefacts.org/what_occupation.html 

but would be glad to discuss the issue before or after.

BTW, the correct terminology is "Disputed" not "Occupied" since there is no 'Palestine' with borders to occupy-- Pending Negotiation.
Certainly the further out settlements are not in good faith and could be referred to as 'occupied' (since they will be in future 'Palestine') but the near in ones/closer to the Green Line- not so much so.
.
 
 
What's your point afak ? Post the relevent parts.

So, there are people living in huge mansions in the UK whilst people live nearby in rundown council flats or are simply homeless. What the hell is the difference - the world has rich and poor - Israelis have worked hard and Israel is now quite a propsperous country. On the other side the "palestinians" have spent 40 years blowing **** up rather than doing anything useful. Both sides, the swimming pool owners and the thirsty are getting what they've worked for.

So are a lot of people. What's your point? That's certainly not the fault of everyday Israeli civilians. And it doesn't change the fact that one in three are below the poverty line. It's not like Israel has an absolutely flourishing economy; quite the contrary.

Similarly, have you ever been to Jordan or Lebanon? I don't hear anyone complaining about their abundance of 'mansions and swimming pools.'

Huge swimming pool mansions right next to water pumps with no water in the UK ? Enlighten me.

 
Israelis have worked hard and Israel is now quite a prosperous country. On the other side the "Palestinians" have spent 40 years blowing **** up rather than doing anything useful. Both sides, the swimming pool owners and the thirsty are getting what they've worked for.
 

Lets take the Bethlehem are for example. It should have received 1200 cubic meters of water per hour, but Israel reduced this to 300 cubic meter per hour, forcing most Palestinians to wait weeks for pipe water. They were forced to buy water for farming on the black market to survive. They were forced to pay $4 per cubic meter for the same water costing Israelis $0.75 per cubic meter. Israeli settlers were selling water which was taken from Palestinian sources, back to desperate Palestinians at a 40% profit. Hardly fair ?

Are ya Sure?

"The Arab armies entered Palestine to protect the Palestinians from the Zionist tyranny but, instead, THEY ABANDONED THEM, FORCED THEM TO EMIGRATE AND TO LEAVE THEIR HOMELAND, imposed upon them a political and ideological blockade and threw them into prisons similar to the ghettos in which the Jews used to live in Eastern Europe, as if we were condemmed to change places with them; they moved out of their ghettos and we occupied similar ones. The Arab States succeeded in scattering the Palestinian people and in destroying their unity. They did not recognize them as a unified people until the States of the world did so, and this is regrettable".

- by Abu Mazen (ever hear of him?), from the article titled: "What We Have Learned and What We Should Do", published in Falastin el Thawra, the official journal of the PLO, of Beirut, in March 1976
...

"The Arab streets are curiously deserted and, ardently following the poor example of the more moneyed class there has been an exodus from Jerusalem too, though not to the same extent as in Jaffa and Haifa."

- London Times, May 5, 1948

"The refugees were confident that their absence would not last long, and that they would return within a week or two. Their leaders had promised them that the Arab armies would crush the 'Zionist gangs' very quickly and that there was no need for panic or fear of a long exile."

- Monsignor George Hakim, Greek Catholic Bishop of Galilee, in the Beirut newspaper Sada al Janub, August 16, 1948

"Of the 62,000 Arabs who formerly lived in Haifa not more than 5,000 or 6,000 remained. Various factors influenced their decision to seek safety in flight. There is but little doubt that the most potent of the factors were the announcements made over the air by the -Higher Arab Executive, urging the Arabs to quit.... It was clearly intimated that those Arabs who remained in Haifa and accepted Jewish protection would be regarded as renegades."

- The London weekly Economist, October 2, 1948

"It must not be forgotten that the Arab Higher Committee encouraged the refugees' flight from their homes in Jaffa, Haifa, and Jerusalem."

- Near East Arabic Broadcasting Station, Cyprus, April 3, 1949

"This wholesale exodus was due partly to the belief of the Arabs, encouraged by the boasting of an unrealistic Arab press and the irresponsible utterances of some of the Arab leaders that it could be only a matter of some weeks before the Jews were defeated by the armies of the Arab States and the Palestinian Arabs enabled to re-enter and retake possession of their country."

- Edward Atiyah (then Secretary of the Arab League Office in London) in The Arabs (London, 1955), p. 183

"The mass evacuation, prompted partly by fear, partly by order of Arab leaders, left the Arab quarter of Haifa a ghost city...By withdrawing Arab workers their leaders hoped to paralyze Haifa.".

- Time, May 3, 1948, p. 25

The Arab exodus, initially at least, was encouraged by many Arab leaders, such as Haj Amin el Husseini, the exiled pro-Nazi Mufti of Jerusalem, and by the Arab Higher Committee for Palestine. They viewed the first wave of Arab setbacks as merely transitory. Let the Palestine Arabs flee into neighboring countries. It would serve to arouse the other Arab peoples to greater effort, and when the Arab invasion struck, the Palestinians could return to their homes and be compensated with the property of Jews driven into the sea.

- Kenneth Bilby, in New Star in the Near East (New York, 1950), pp. 30-31

I do not want to impugn anybody but only to help the refugees. The fact that there are these refugees is the direct consequence of the action of the Arab States in opposing Partition and the Jewish State. The Arab States agreed upon this policy unanimously and they must share in the solution of the problem, [Daily Telegraph, September 6, 1948

- Emil Ghoury, Secretary of the Arab Higher Committee, the official leadership of the Palestinian Arabs, in the Beirut newspaper, Daily Telegraph, September 6, 1948

The Arab States encouraged the Palestine Arabs to leave their homes temporarily in order to be out of the way of the Arab invasion armies.

- Falastin (Jordanian newspaper), February 19, 1949

We will smash the country with our guns and obliterate every place the Jews seek shelter in. The Arabs should conduct their wives and children to safe areas until the fighting has died down.

- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Said, quoted in Sir Am Nakbah ("The Secret Behind the Disaster") by Nimr el Hawari, Nazareth, 1952

....

"The Arab governments told us: Get out so that we can get in. So we got out, but they did not get in."

- from the Jordan daily Ad Difaa, September 6, 1954

"The Arab civilians panicked and fled ignominiously. Villages were frequently abandoned before they were threatened by the progress of war."

- General Glubb Pasha, in the London Daily Mail on August 12, 1948

"[The Arabs of Haifa] fled in spite of the fact that the Jewish authorities guaranteed their safety and rights as citizens of Israel."

- Monsignor George Hakim, Greek Catholic Bishop of Galilee, according to Rev. Karl Baehr, Executive Secretary of the American Christian Palestine Committee, New York Herald Tribune, June 30, 1949

"The Arabs did not want to submit to a truce they rather preferred to abandon their homes, their belongings and everything they possessed in the world and leave the town. This is in fact what they did."

- Jamal Husseini, Acting Chairman of the Palestine Arab Higher Committee, told to the United Nations Security Council, quoted in the UNSC Official Records (N. 62), April 23, 1948, p. 14

"the military and civil authorities and the Jewish representative expressed their profound regret at this grave decision [to evacuate]. The [Jewish] Mayor of Haifa made a passionate appeal to the delegation to reconsider its decision"

- The Arab National Committee of Haifa, told to the Arab League, quoted in The Refugee in the World, by Joseph B. Schechtman, 1963

.......

"The existence of these refugees is a direct result of the Arab States' opposition to the partition plan and the reconstitution of the State of Israel. The Arab states adopted this policy unanimously, and the responsibility of its results, therefore is theirs.
...The flight of Arabs from the territory allotted by the UN for the Jewish state began immediately after the General Assembly decision at the end of November 1947. This wave of emigration, which lasted several weeks, comprised some thirty thousand people, chiefly well-to-do-families."

- Emil Ghory, secretary of the Arab High Council, Lebanese daily Al-Telegraph, 6 Sept 1948

"Since 1948 we have been demanding the return of the refugees to their homes. But we ourselves are the ones who encouraged them to leave. Only a few months separated our call to them to leave and our appeal to the United Nations to resolve on their return."

- Haled al Azm, the Syrian Prime Minister in 1948-49, The Memoirs of Haled al Azm, (Beirut, 1973), Part 1, pp. 386-387

"Since 1948 it is we who demanded the return of refugees... while it is we who made them to leave...
We brought disaster upon... Arab refugees, by inviting them and bringing pressure to bear upon them to leave...
We have rendered them dispossessed...
We have accustomed them to begging...
We have participated in lowering their moral and social level...
Then we exploited them in executing crimes of murder, arson, and throwing bombs upon... men, women and children - all this in service of Political purposes..."

- Khaled al Azm, Syria's Prime Minister after the 1948 war [note: same person as above]

"As early as the first months of 1948 the Arab League issued orders exhorting the people to seek a temporary refuge in neighboring countries, later to return to their abodes in the wake of the victorious Arab armies and obtain their share of abandoned Jewish property."

- bulletin of The Research Group for European Migration Problems, 1957

One morning in April 1948, Dr. Jamal woke us to say that the Arab Higher Committee (AHC), led by the Husseinis, had warned Arab residents of Talbieh to leave immediately. The understanding was that the residents would be able to return as conquerors as soon as the Arab forces had thrown the Jews out. Dr. Jamal made the point repeatedly that he was leaving because of the AHC's threats, not because of the Jews, and that he and his frail wife had no alternative but to go.

Yep, I got it... "Fact"

What Really Happened in 1948
By Sarah El Shazly
FrontPageMag.com
Dec 28, 2004

"...But there is a third side, that of those who lived there and still do -- the Israeli Arabs...."

[...]

Misinformation surrounds the story of 1948. Palestinians who fled their homes are angry, bitter and distraught.
The fact is that the Arab world warned the Palestinians against staying with the Jews.
They also warned them that Arabs were going in to fight the Zionists and that the Palestinians should leave to avoid getting hurt.

Many Palestinians trusted these Arab leaders and left as instructed. Those who had lived with Jews for a long time were not as easily convinced of the danger, and these Arabs stayed home.
Among them was my family, which saw cars traveling the area. The cars contained Jews.
They reassured Arabs that they would not be harmed. Thus, we had a situation where Jews begged Arabs to stay and live with them, while Arabs from foreign countries told them to leave right away.

Palestinians have gotten the short end of the stick in Arab society. It suits Arab leaders to keep this group in a state of poverty and conflict, and to channel all resentment toward the Jews. You don't believe me? Ask yourself why Jordan or Egypt or Syria never gave the Palestinians a country? If I hear another non-Palestinian, especially an American Muslim, repeat the phrase "over 50 years of the Zionist occupation," I'm going to burst. Can no one actually read history? It’s not ancient history, just 1948-1967. Who had that land? Even if Arabs want Palestinians to have "all" the land, this is no excuse for denying them an independent state. And yet, we blame Israel!

"....Let's take this a step further. The Arab world pretends to care, watching a young Palestinian get killed by Israel on TV, justifying Jew-hatred right before they go to their cozy beds. This is the Arab world that has taught Palestinians to fight, and yet it will not give them citizenship. Where is that love -- or, for that matter, where is the passion used to justify the Palestinian issue?

Let's go to the refugees. Arab governments first used scare tactics, and then took whatever they could get from the United States and Israel. Finally, they stuck Palestinians in camps with deplorable living conditions. Why didn't they leave them alone in their homes? Why promise them refuge and reward them with nothing more than prison camps? And, most of all, why didn't they provide Palestinians with homes in the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights when Arabs had control over them?..."

"...As a Palestinian, I ask the world to please stop exploiting our issue. If you want a do a good deed, find your own. To the singers romanticizing Palestinian suffering, it is not romantic. There is nothing dreamy about it. Where’s the heroism in a small child throwing rocks at a tank? Either warn the child to stay away or just shut up! How dare you do this to our children? Does our suffering give you such good video footage and high ratings?

To the average Arab citizen, stop crying crocodile tears for us. We thank you for your kind feelings, but please, don’t offer us your pity. To the Arab and Islamic governments, fix your own problems. Do not use our misery to blind your subjects to domestic problems. Are you afraid that the people will wise up, and stop hating Israel, and turn on you? You, who have condoned so much hatred, may one day pay the price. You've created monsters, and you won't be able to handle them. Worry about creating jobs for your own poor people and educating the children, and leave us alone. In short, to all those invested in driving our children to die, please, stay away from us.

I am simply comparing like with like. People who have much of something often live near to people who do not have much of that thing. That doesn't mean that the one with more is guilty or bad because of it it generally means they've simply done more to get it. Oh, and let's think this through further. Namely by considering the Gulf States which are HEAVING with oil dollars and yet where a significant amount of the population lives in abject poverty. Why aren't you whining about them?

I think you're probably right, by and large, although the genuine sympathy for co-believers that links Muslims across the world muddies the waters somewhat.

de facto, "Palestine" exists. There are lines on the map separating it from Israel. If a spring or a mine or a farm or a fruit-tree is in Gaza or the West Bank then surely it, and its produce, can only reasonably be viewed as Palestinian.

Even disregarding the fact that the "palestinians" are an invention in themselves and I don't believe inventions can lay claim to anything, then why does that follow? Surely a tree or mine belongs to the person who owns the land it's on, whatever he may be. If a tree in Israel is on the land of an Arab Muslim it is not a "Jewish" tree. So, if a Jew grows a tree in the West Bank, is it a "palestinian" tree? No, it is not.

I couldn't find the site I got the Bethlehem info from. Twas ages ago.

 

So you cite the BBC and four links from openly anti-Israel groups. The BBC one being 3 and a half years old and heavy on quotes from partisan sources. How convincing.
 
 
Those 4 "anti-Israel" get their stories from other sources. Don't pretend you've looked at them.

I haven't. I can't be bothered to deal with the anti-Israel obssession of cretinous, terrorism-supporting muslims anymore. They should sort out the s**tty State of the dozens of Islamic and Arabic States - not to mention the scale of inter-Muslim killing that makes anything Israel does pale in comparison - before they try and attack and demonise the one civilised State in the whole region. Instead of using Israel as a convenient diversion from the myriad of problems within their own "society", they should have a deep-look at themselves. Israel kills 4,000 Muslims during 6 years of what is essentially war, and they scream. Muslims kill that many Muslims in a month in Iraq - in pointless terrorism and sectarian violence, not even justified by something such as defending themselves - and Muslims just blame everyone else but the Muslims responsible. It's pathetic, thew whole lot of them need to grow up and stop acting like lunatics and children.

This is what the editor-in-chief of Al Jazeera said in a recent interview:

Question: Who is responsible for the situation?
Answer: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the most important reasons why these crises and problems continue to simmer. The day when Israel was founded created the basis for our problems. The West should finally come to understand this. Everything would be much calmer if the Palestinians were given their rights.

Question: Do you mean to say that if Israel did not exist, there would suddenly be democracy in Egypt, that the schools in Morocco would be better, that the public clinics in Jordan would function better?
Answer: I think so.

Question: Can you please explain to me what the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has to do with these problems?
Answer: The Palestinian cause is central for Arab thinking.

Question: In the end, is it a matter of feelings of self-esteem?
Answer: Exactly. It’s because we always lose to Israel. It gnaws at the people in the Middle East that such a small country as Israel, with only about 7 million inhabitants, can defeat the Arab nation with its 350 million. That hurts our collective ego. The Palestinian problem is in the genes of every Arab. The West’s problem is that it does not understand this.

And as a blogger comments: "The West does understand. In this part of the world, blaming all your problems on a super-powerful fantasy opponent is called “mental illness.”"

And that thinking is positively endemic in the Arab world.

Ha! Now they're edited to being "openly" anti-Israeli ? They give the facts, deal with it. Oxfam, the AFP, Palestine monitor, and the PMC are not "openly anti-Israeli" in any sense. Trying to build an image of bias where there isn't is childish. Grow up Jon.

If you think that "palestine monitor" and "palestine media center" aren't biased you need your head examined.

To quote the "Mission Statement" of PMC:
"1. The Palestine Media Center henceforth the (PMC) is an independent official institution established in November 2001. The PMC is under the direct supervision of PLO [Palestine Liberation Organisation] Executive Committee Member Mr. Yasser Abed Rabbo."

The PLO being the pre-eminent palestinian terrorist group for decades and still a part of palestinian governmental structure. No bias there, I'm sure.

To quote the "About Us" of Palestine Monitor:
"At the outbreak of the current Intifada in September 2000, The Palestinian Non-Governmental Network (PNGO) perceived a real lack of the Palestinian narrative in the media. This lack was attributed to the fact that very little advocacy was being carried out on behalf of the Palestinians; and whatever advocacy work Palestinians carried out did not address the foreign audience in the best manner possible."

It's openly a palestinian advocacy group.

And you tell me there's "no bias" from these groups? You're either pig-ignorant or a liar. Choose.

Lovely straw-man. You're so idiotic you have to literally MAKE UP "my logic" in order to argue against it. My logic is simple. Facts and truth exist, and are valued by the pro-Israeli side, whereas the palestinians frequently deal in distortion, defamation and outright lies - demonstrating a disregard for truth or fact.

"Palestinians" aren't a race. And they are pathologically dishonest - they invent and propagate communal lies such as those regarding Jenin. Truth has no meaning for them.

Jews are a people, whereas the very existence of "palestinians" is, at its base, a lie - as are the myriad of lies they tell the world.
 
 
Of course they're a race, you tool. Welcome to the far-right. Enjoy your stay.
 
 
... No, they're not. Might want to check your history and notice that prior to the 1960s they were simply "Arabs" and that in Mandatory times the word "palestinian" was actually used to refer to Jews of the Mandate. See, this is an example of my care for truth and fact against your love of lies.
 
 
"Water"
(and I notice while Invocation Demands I excerpt my articles with the relevant passages.. He just posts 5 links in one post with NO comment or excerpts)

"....And accusations of “stealing water” are just the latest canard from the Palestinian propaganda ministries.
In fact, the Palestinians in the West Bank actually rely on Israeli expertise to provide them with water services since Arab water agencies are notorious for letting their aquifers become polluted.
In Gaza, all of the water is supplied directly to the area from Israel yet the Palestine Authority still claims Israel is “stealing their water.”..."

 http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles...e.asp?ID=12576 

Does Israel Use 'Palestinian' Water (March/April 2000)

"...3. What About Palestinian Consumption?

In the period from 1967 to 1995 West Bank Palestinians increased their domestic water use by 640%, from 5.4 MCM to 40 MCM (Judea-Samaria and the Gaza District – A 16 Year Survey 1967 – 1983, Israel, Ministry of Defense, 1983; Arnon Soffer, The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict over Water Resources, Palestine-Israel Journal, Volume 5, No. 1, 1998). By way of comparison, in the same 28 year period Israeli domestic usage increased by just 142 percent (Statistical Abstract of Israel 1996, V47).
This huge jump in Palestinian consumption was possible only because Israel drilled or permitted the drilling of over 50 new wells for the Palestinian population, laid hundreds of kilometers of new water mains and connected hundreds of Palestinian villages and towns to the newly built water system (Background - Water, Israel and the Middle East, Israel Foreign Ministry 1991; Marcia Drezon-Tepler, Contested Waters and the Prospects for Arab-Israeli Peace, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 30, No. 2, April 1994).
Palestinian sources broadly confirm this picture...."

"...4. Israel Supplies Water to the Palestinians, Jordan, and Lebanon

Contrary to charges that Israel uses Arab water, the reality is the reverse: Israel has supplied, from its own sources, large amounts of water to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, to the Kingdom of Jordan, and to a number of villages in South Lebanon.
Meanwhile, Jordan has not supplied the West Bank with any water since 1967, despite its obligation, under international legal guidelines, to supply 70-150 MCM annually...."

I think you're probably right, by and large, although the genuine sympathy for co-believers that links Muslims across the world muddies the waters somewhat.

Ahh.. He steps in it again.

BTW buddy, I never got your responses to debate/rebuttal for "water", "Refugees", or use of Links without excerpt etc.

Once more you are just bluster and... guess what...

 
What is the evidence that the United Nations is biased against Israel?

[...]
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, speaking to the American Jewish Committee in December 1999, said:

I know that to some of you in this audience, and to the Jewish community at large, it sometimes seems that the United Nations served all the world's peoples but one: the Jews.

[...]

Security Council

From its first meetings in 1946, at least one Arab state sat on the UN Security Council in most years, while Israel has been kept ineligible for membership by manipulation of the regional groups.
The Security Council has repeatedly adopted one-sided resolutions charging Israel with sole responsibility for human rights violations, violence and deportations. On the other hand, Palestinian and other Arab violations and involvement with such incidents are rarely criticized, or even noted by the Council.

In an analysis of the Security Council's record up to 1989, of 175 total resolutions passed by the Council, 97 were directed against Israel, as contrasted with 4 against all Arab states combined.
The Council expressed its 'concern,' 'grave concern,' 'regret,' 'deep regrets,' 'shock' etc. about Israeli actions 31 times.
Regarding Arab actions, the Council Never expressed negative sentiments.
Only the veto power of the US prevented these numbers from being even more one-sided against Israel.

Because it has been blocked from membership in any regional group, Israel is the only nation in the world that is denied the right to hold a seat on the UN Security Council on a rotating basis. Israel's recent temporary membership in the Western Europe and Others (WEOG) regional group cannot change this for years.

[...]

In October 2000, after the collapse of the Camp David talks and the start of the al-Aqsa intifada, a Special Emergency Session of the United Nations passed a one-sided resolution condemning Israel for the violence. The UN ignored numerous incidents planned and initiated by the Palestinian Authority such as the lynching in Ramallah, the desecration of Joseph's Tomb and the ancient synagogue in Jericho, as well as the ongoing acts of violence on the part of the Palestinians. Only Israel was condemned.

General Assembly

The United Nations General Assembly gives one vote per member country, and there are many more small developing Islamic countries than large non-Islamic developed countries...."

In the years 1947 to 1989, the General Assembly passed a total of 690 resolutions (full or partial). Of these, 429 were against the Israeli position while only 56 were against Arab positions. Of the 56 votes not to the Arabs' liking, 49 concerned the establishment or financing of peace-keeping forces. Absent these, the last anti-Arab vote in the General Assembly, on any issue, was in May of 1949.

"...The numerical strength of the Arab states and the Non-Aligned Movement in the General Assembly created the long series of offensive, anti-Israel, anti-American and anti-Western resolutions, capped by the infamous 1975 "Zionism equals racism" Resolution 3379. Except for Resolution 3379 itself, repealed in 1991, these black marks of injustice remain on the General Assembly's record.

In December 1991, the infamous 1975 "Zionism equals racism" resolution was repealed by the General Assembly. The repeal effort, which should have been a self-evident proposition, required an extensive diplomatic lobbying campaign by the United States, Israel and a few others...."

---The UN has repeatedly held Emergency Special Sessions of the General Assembly on Israeli construction in Jerusalem. The Emergency Special Session was originally convened in 1950 for emergencies like the Korean War.
In the last 15 years, these special meetings have Only been held regarding Israel.
Emergency Special Sessions were Not convened over the genocide in Rwanda, ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, or with regard to the other major world conflicts, but they were convened to condemn Israelis moving into buildings they own in territory they have a legitimate claim to.

(abu note: Bonus time)

In 1999, the Palestinian Arabs tried another tactic. Forgetting that it was the Arabs who rejected General Assembly Resolution 181 in 1948 and prevented its implementation, they launched an international diplomatic campaign to revive 181 as a basis to create a Palestinian state. They want another 1947 partition vote because the borders of Israel, under Resolution 181, would be smaller than the negotiated borders called for in the later UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, adopted after the Six Day War in 1967 and generally accepted as a reasonable basis for peace with secure borders. Resolution 181 also provides that Jerusalem......"

Originally Posted by mizfissy815

Yeah, because the Arab world's done a mighty fine job of avoiding THAT accusation.

 
You'll find that there are significant(probably the majority) number of Arabs that do care for the Palestinians and their cause. Their governments on the other hand...
 

That's precisely what I was saying. The Ummah-wide bond is sufficiently strong that most Muslims in the world will automatically sympathise with the Palestinians' troubles, even if they've never met a Palestinian or been within a thousand miles of the Middle East. (No smart remarks about Hajj   ) But the governments think far less about that and far more about being devious and manipulative to serve their own ends, and thus slam their doors (or rather, borders) in the Palestinians' faces.
 
 
Firstly, no-one's pretending that Palestine and the other Arab nations are democratic wealthy Western nations, but this is something that Israel does see itself as. And democratic wealthy Western nations are civilised places that don't continuously wage religous war against poor rural Muslims.

I can hear the floods of objection already, telling me in no uncertain terms that I've got it "completely wrong" and it's the "other way round," which it very well may be. but that doesn't matter. What people think matters. So while the world press continues the supposed "anti-Israel bias," no-one will care about all the quotes and all the articles spurted out to, as abu_afak but it, "debunk" the "uneducated."

Secondly, historically no-one likes the Jews. From the 1290 expulsion of the Jews from England to the Holocaust, Jews have been shunted from place to place, meeting ghettoisation and death. No-one liked the Jews, and I don't see what could have happened since then to magically make everyone love and them. To quote a line from the film 'Tea With Mussolini,' "it's never a good time to be a Jew."

Finally, it's easy to blame the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for many of the world's ills. The world needs something to **** on, to be annoyed about from a safe distance, to argue about on forums endlessly, because everyone knows it isn't going away any time soon.

So the basic trend is, everyone who spouts masses of pro-Israeli propaganda (because that's what it is, and you know it, even if it is fact) is branded a zionist and the information they use is disregarded, "because that's what they would say isn't it," and all the Palestinian propaganda is used as evidence against "those nasty Israeli occupiers." Israel will never win over the world media because there'd be no fun in it. I expect if you trace it back far enough you'll find that the whole conflict is exacerbated by Rupert Murdoch being anti-semitic   (not that I'm suggesting, or have any proof that, he is anti-semitic).

Even supposedly independent channels such as the BBC are massively biased towards Israel. If there is a suicide bomb in Israel, its headline news, if there's an atrocity committed by Israeli forces then its an 'also ran' story.

The real problem is also that no one bothers to show what goes on in Palestine on a day to day basis. I'm don't mean to lecture people like some wizened old man but I do know people who have first hand accounts of what its like. I honestly believe that if anyone tried to live as Palestinian, even with identical outlooks to what they have now, then they're minds would be soon be changed to being one hundred percent against Israel.

There are attacks against Israel on a a daily basis, depsite the fact 90% are caught before they attack. As far as i recall there hasnt been a story on it for a while. Of course its gona make international news when 20 people are called by a bomb in Tel Aviv, just like it did when it happened in turkey not so long ago.

I'm afraid I have to disagree with you. The Beeb runs more human interest stories about the Palestinian plight than Israeli attacks. As does C4 news. In fact most British news agencies do, I think, hold a slight bias against Israel.

"Today in Israel, another attack did not take place. Again."

It doesn't exactly sound like headline news around the world does it. People get tired of hearing the same thing over and over. It's boring.

Such as the Palestinian that got on to a minni bus and stabed sevral people, I guess since its only a knife attack its not worth showing, at least it wasnt on UK TV.

Infact at any one time there are 50-100 wars going on with an esitmated death per minute.

Why is it that only Israel whos conflict with Palestinians is much smaller, is the only country crtisized and why is it that people seem to forget that these terrorists who flat out say they want to destroy Israel that apprntly Israle is expected to ignore have killed over 1000 Isralei civilians in the last decade? As if Israel is just going out there to kill Palestinians.

 

lol this is`patheitc..

'over 1000 israeli civilians killed the in the last decade'

ISRAEL KILLED 1200 CIVILIANS IN ONE MONTH OF FIGHTING IN LEBANON YOU MORON.

Or wait..

israeli blood is more valuable than arab blood right?
 
 
How about actually responding to the objections raised in the post, instead of just repeating yourself and making racist remarks? There are countries who, purely in terms of people killed, are four hundred times worse than Israel, so why don't you criticise them too? What is Israel supposed to do, anyway, just sit there and take it?

NO, they didn't liar! The number of civillians killed was NOWHERE NEAR 1200!

News agencies alone (when added up) reported the deaths of around 250 hizbollah fighters in different areas. Israel supplied the names and addresses of around 500 (maybe a bit less) hizbollah fighters killed! The number of civillians killed was around 600-700, NOT 1200! So hizbollah's number of just over 100 fighters killed is a pathetic lie...

FFS, for the last time, STOP IT! 1 life = 1 life regardless of colour, creed, race or religion! Get off your soap box!

First of all its stupid to accept israel's figures of hezbullah deaths since we know very well the lies of the zionist regime: every dya olmert used to come on tv and say that so and so was under israeli control when news crews on the ground showed absolutely no israeli control in the area. Hell, one case, olmert bragged about reaching the litani river and controllign everything there when there was still fighting on the border villages! Or should i mention how every time olmert said he destroyed most of hezbullah's rocket abilities, hezbullah wud volley 300 rockets at israel after he finishes his speach?

Secondly, if you believe arab blood = israeli blood why dont you give me the name of one of the kids killed in any of the massacres israel carried out in lebanon or any name from the family killed by the israeli artillery in gaza. You diont know their name right? No one does. But everyone knows the name of shalit, the one israeli SOLDIER kidnapped by palestenians!

Have you even considered for a minute that the reason no one knows the names of these people killed in Israeli masscres is because they don't exist?
 
 
The Arab world is worse than any Israeli state. A bunch of incestual dictators[monarchies lol] and their families sucking up the revenues of energy reserves to build absurdly large palaces to cater for their 50-odd wives.

The Arabs moan and whine about Israel, but the last time they tried to re-claim Israel forcefully they were destroyed by a number less than half their size.

a) The israelis figures are infinitely more reliable than hizbollahs figures. NEWS AGENCIES counted more hizbollah deaths than hizbollah mentioned. Israel provided names and adresses of all the soldiers they killed!

b) When olmert said they had reached the litani river, a batallion HAD reached the litani river, he never said everything south of the litani was under israeli control!

c) A LOT of hizbollahs rocket capabilities were destroyed! You sound almost proud that hizbollah fired rockets at civillians...! As hizbollahs rockets were largely hidden, it was difficult for israel to destroy them all, but this argument has been re-hashed hundreds of times on here!

 
Secondly, if you believe arab blood = israeli blood why dont you give me the name of one of the kids killed in any of the massacres israel carried out in lebanon or any name from the family killed by the israeli artillery in gaza.

a) Gilad Shalit was doing his national service and he got kidnapped. Something that had been planned for months (due to the tunnels etc.) despite ceasefire. He was innocent.

b) When israel fire into Gaza, they do so because either rockets have been launched or terrorists/soon-to-be suicide bombers are roaming the streets. When children get killed (if they've not been used as human shields) it's an accident. Israel does not mean to kill children or any civillians, but as warfare is progressing the way it is, unfortunately many innocents are being killed!

Ok then, name one of the kids killeds by Hezbolah rockets, oyu dont know?  

So how come i havent seen you condem the killing of Palestinian children by Palestinian militants? I guess it just sliped your mind. It only matters when Israel kills a Palestinian. People forget The palestinians pretty much dont stop killing each other.

Here are some sources

Israel is made out to be bad because the far left media bais (BBC) stick up for Palestine and promote anti-Israeli propaganda.

Israel all the way!
 
 
 
a) The israelis figures are infinitely more reliable than hizbollahs figures. NEWS AGENCIES counted more hizbollah deaths than hizbollah mentioned. Israel provided names and adresses of all the soldiers they killed!
 

Shows what you know. The figure that the media uses is from 1) Israeli list and 2) burial of dead fighters.

Which is highly inaccurate seeing that Israel is a combatant who wants to project a good image of it's self. Look at the pasting Olmert and The stalin looking guy Peretz (The guy looks like stalin   ) are getting. It also forgets that there were local people fighting in the war. It wasn't just the Nasr Brigade.

There was an independent analysis done on the war by people who know their stuff. There conclusion. Israel got pasted. If you want i can give you links.

The reason why Israel is looked upon badly. Is because.
1: A lot of jews suddenly went into Palestine when the cliamte in Europe wasn't good.
2: They took over the land.
3: Palestinians live has refugees in their own country.
4: Israelis act has if they have a right to live on Palestine and deny that the Palestinians exist.
 
 
I heard something interesting, which is that subconsiously people do not perseive danger in terms of the number of people killed, but in terms of how shocking the image is.

I think it would probably follow to say that the same things happen with people killed, we here about sudan but never see pictures of it, but in Israel and the west bank there are always pictures of what is happening.

Like stalin said "one death is a trajedy, 1,000,000 deaths is just a statistic"

what they never showed you on the news

So israel have murdered 120,000 Palestinian civilians in the last 6 years? Palestinian gunmen have killed Palestinians on many occasions and no one cares, so why is it diffrent when Israel does it?

The point is, i never made any mention of, lots of Israleis have been killed so it doesnt matter that Palestinians have been killed, but you quickly jump to basicly say so what if this happened it doesnt matter, because more Palestinains died.

Basicaly the whole world is taking sides, pretty much 'egging them on' and its the Israelis and Palestinians that loose out since they have both lost 1000's of people since year 2000 and it hurts both of their economies, of which palestinians is now crushed since the west has stoped funding it in protest to the anti israel/west messages being put in school text books since hamas came to power.

The hamas rise to power reminds me of the nazis rise to power. When they first came aobut no gave them a second thought, but 'bad times' led to them becoming more popular. Just as the germans supporting the nazis neough to do so doesnt mean that suddenly they are all bad, and nor does it mean that about the palestinians, they dont have hate in their blood from when they are born but lovely people like hamas currupt their minds.

Wtf your answer to the solutions then? Probably something in the lines of "They can go to arab countries and give us gaza and west bank".

Well Israel reminds me of the Nazis. Using propaganda that "Arabs are trying to get them. An innocent bystander" You know Israeli media are allowed more freedom then other press to film IDF. But if the army don't like what they see the channel can't show it. That is hiding the truth.

No, that's called common ****ing sense. British media are allowed to film British forces more thna foreign media outlets are. Want to know why? Because they're British!

I think the fact that im being very fair here, and you constantly slag israel off pretty much proves the point your trying to argue against.

Progranda that arabs are out to get them? Is this the propaganda about how with in a day of the UN naming Israel a country, they get attacked by 6 arab countries, is this about sevral other wars they have had with the arabs either due to disputes e.g. with Eygpt blocking the sueze cannal, or the arabs just deciing to attack ie yom kippur war.

Is it the propaganda over the 1000's of Israelis killed by arabs, is it the proganda about 1000's of missiles being fired in to Israel, is it propaganda over the fact that not only terrorist groups but nations ie Iran openly call for the destruction of Israel.

I dont see any propaganda here, just actual facts.
 
 
Do the anti-Israel crowd (as distinct from the pro-Palestinian crowd, because that's not quite the same thing) EVER acknowledge that Palestinian militants can be in the wrong? The pro-Israel crowd are not averse to admitting fault.
 
 
I am going to share with you a story, that might shed a light on why israel - other than killing women and children (by mistake my ass) - is unfair.

 
JERUSALEM – Sherifa Shawara wants to get married. She wears fashionable skinny jeans and studies geography and history. The second-year college student doesn't lack for suitors. The problem is where she lives.
One young man trying to visit her in Nuaman, an Arab village inside Jerusalem, was turned away by Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance to her community from the West Bank. Nonresidents cannot enter.

Another suitor backed off when he realized that making her his bride would banish him from Jerusalem, the city of his birth. Although Ms. Shawara lives within the Israeli-drawn boundaries of Jerusalem, she holds a West Bank ID and could be arrested if she's caught inside the city but outside her village. She can't travel, study, or work in Jerusalem.

Palestinian West Bankers can't reach her. Palestinian Jerusalemites don't want her. She is cut off from the city: a similar reality that one-quarter of the city's Arab residents, a new report says, may soon face as Israel's security barrier zigzags around the city, creating a new boundaries.

"I can't move. I can't go anywhere," says Shawara, locking her arms across her chest and gazing bitterly into the distance. "Last week, the soldiers told me my name wasn't on the list and I couldn't go home. Recently, we went shopping and bought a lot, and the soldier wouldn't even let us enter the village in a taxi, so we had to carry it all on foot."

Her story is just one of numerous examples of how life in this city - which lies at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - is fast becoming less penetrable and more gerrymandered. As the boundaries around Jerusalem harden, Palestinians are being shut off not only culturally but economically as well. Critics of the wall say these new burdens will only cultivate more anger toward Israel.
 
 
 
Why can't she move?

If that WERE the reason why jews moved to 'palestine' there would be nothing wrong with it.

The took it over by buying the land and working the land up from malaria-ridden swamp into trhiving metropolises and barren deserts into fruit orchards!

 
3: Palestinians live has refugees in their own country.
 

Was it not the jordanians and egyptians who pushed the palestinians in to refugee camps, denied them a right to higher education, water, and almost all basic human rights? The lives of the 'palestinians' has improved dramatically since israel came under control of gaza and the west bank!

NO, the palestinians don't live a great life, but unemployment is well down compared to what it was, there are around 10 palestinians universities, the palestinians are getting more water etc. etc.

 
4: Israelis act has if they have a right to live on Palestine and deny that the Palestinians exist.
 

Israelis have a right to live in israel!

The palestinians had the right to stay in 1947/8, they were encouraged to by the jews. Those who did, have swimming pools, large villas and a great free life. Many of those who decided to leave were pushed in to refugee camps by the arab states and left there to rot!

The palestinians have a right to a state, and israelis believe that (despite what YOU may think)! If there was more compromise (unlike in 2000 when arafat made NO counter-offer) then maybe we'd get there a little quicker!

Speaking for myself, a sensible solution (and how i reckon it will end up) is that israel will give up the golan (but make it demilitarized) in exchange for peace with syria. Gaza and west bank will become a palestinian state, with parts of east jerusalem (certainly NOT including the jewish quarter of old jerusalem) as their capital. They'll get sovereignty over the temple mount etc.
There won't be a right of return but israel WILL pay 'reparations' (not the right word, but u know what i mean....)!

[It would be nice if jordan carved out some land for a palestinians state but....]

"Occasion" is close, but even more shocking is

 
Palestinians seeing internal violence
Salt Lake Tribune
Oct 7, 2005
Mohammed Daraghmeh

RAMALLAH, West Bank - The number of Palestinians slain in vigilante killings and other internal violence has nearly quadrupled in four years, from 43 in 2002 to 151 so far in 2005, according to statistics presented Thursday.

A top security official said more Palestinians were killed in internal violence this year than by Israeli troops.

The descent into lawlessness is hurting Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas politically at a time when he is trying to beat back a tough challenge by Islamic militant rivals. This week, a Palestinian parliament frustrated with armed gangs and corrupt police officers ordered Abbas to disband his Cabinet and make crime-fighting his top priority.

''The security situation is deteriorating in a very dangerous way, with no one putting a stop to it,'' said Hassan Khreisheh, the deputy parliament speaker.

[.................]

Abu Khoussa said that in 2005, more Palestinians were killed by fellow Palestinians than in fighting with Israel.

He did not provide figures, but his claim was backed up by the Independent Commission for Human Rights, an independent Palestinian group.

Majed Arouri, a researcher for the group, said 151 Palestinians have been slain in internal violence or as a result of reckless behavior by militants in 2005 so far. The Palestinian-on-Palestinian death toll rose sharply in September when 22 people were killed by rockets that exploded inadvertently at a Hamas military parade.

By comparison, 140 Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops during the same period, Arouri said.

According to an Associated Press count, the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire stands at 127 in 2005 so far, while the Palestinian Health Ministry said the total number was closer to 200. AP does not keep a count of Palestinians killed in internal violence....."

and btw, I say "thank goodness" for the fence for bringing these numbers down so dramatically.

How about the number of people Israel have killed in 2006 ? I'm sure that would have a greater difference of 11.

Wow, what a way to totally avoid the question.
 
 
Why should anyone answer your questions when you happily admit your arguments are based on assumptions without any evidence? Pathetic.
 
 
I'll take the Lebanon war as an example. I don't see why the comparative numbers should differ much.

You have to at least be able to back up/argue your own side!  

It's you who intimated something about 2006.

"lebanon", Yup some casualties there, but your switching topics/desperate.

We're talking about Palestinians. Yikes!
How about Muslim casualties/victims in Sudan?

Excuse me, but the title of this thread is "Is Israel so bad". Not "Is Israel so bad to the Palestinians".

2006 Lebanese war:

Lebanese civilians killed = 1,191 dead
Israeli civilians = 43 dead

As you can see it's has more of a difference of 11.  

 
How about Muslim casualties/victims in Sudan?
 

As this has nothing to do with Israel, YOU are switching topics and becoming desperate. Pfft.

Why can't the the Palestinians return? I mean it was their land. Also what about the Israeli Arabs. Are they still going to be in a Israel. Even the areas of the north where the Arabs are the majority. Would they join the Palestinian states? What about the settlement roads? This was the stumbling block in 2000. Arafat could have 80 to 90% of west bank. But the settlement roads in west bank belonged to Israel and the Palestinians couldn't use it. Essentially cutting up the Palestinian states into small pieces separate from each other.

The reparation. How much would it be? Would it be a full refund for all of the lost properties? Because that would be expensive. I know jews have the stereotype of being rich and what not. But i doubt anyone can afford to pay for land and houses from the past if you adjusted for inflation.

The propaganda i am talking about is for example. During the '82 invasion. Sharon and Begin lied to invade Lebanon. During a period of more then one year. Only 2 attacks. Yet they lied to the and kept talking about how there was so much terrorist activity in southern Lebanon. Reminds me of Gleiwitz incident.

No post-war refugees from any group can "return". Pakistanis/Indians from their 1947 partition (in fact it's law they cannot), Sudeten Germans, Karelian Finns.. tens of millions.. all finished.
Only these coddled/created 'Palestinians' were kept in camps by their Arab brethren. Not allowed citizenship, land ownership, or jobs; to be used forever as pawns against the Jews.

Perhaps 10,000-20,000 real refugees remain of the original 600,000-700,000. Many tens of thousands already returned. The rest of the [now] 4 million never lived in what is now Israel.
How preposterous!
Get on with their lives.

"What was "their land"?
2/3 of Israel was State Land, owned by no arab; a decent portion of the rest was owned by Jews. How are we going to get 4 million Arabs in there. Everyone knows this is a non-starter.

Thus..
 
The reparation. How much would it be? Would it be a full refund for all of the lost properties?...
 

"Reparation" for who?
The 750,000 Jews forced from Arab countries at the same time the Arab refugees were created? Moroccan, Syrian, Iraqi Jews going to get paid too?
Get on with your lives.

Blaming Jews/eliminating Israel is really what defines palestinian-ism.
There was no Palestine from 1948-1967 when Arabs controlled the WB and Gaza.

 
Where hatred trumps bread
Wall St Journal 2003
Cynthia Ozick

"...No one can refute the truth that the Palestinians have fashioned a culture peculiarly their own--but one so steeped in the negative as to have been turned into a kind of anti-history.
In order to deprive Jews of their patrimony, Palestinians have fabricated a sectarian narrative alien to commonplace knowledge. Although the Arab invasion of Palestine did not occur until the seventh century, Palestinian Arabs are declared to be, according to activist Salah Jabr, "the descendants of civilizations that have lived in this land since the Stone Age." With equal absurdity, other such deniers of Jewish patrimony claim a Canaanite bloodline. By replacing history with fantasy, the Palestinians have invented a society unlike any other, where hatred trumps bread. They have reared children unlike any other children, removed from ordinary norms and behaviors. And they have been assisted in these deviations by Arab rulers who for half a century have purposefully and pitilessly caged and stigmatized them as refugees, down to the fourth generation.
Refugeeism, abetted also by the United Nations, has itself been joined to the Palestinian cult of anti-history. A people respectful of history, including its own above all, will work to fructify and invigorate life; it will not debase and vitiate it...

Goodness me. Could this be in exactly the same way that, when Fatah and Hamas kill people in the crossfire of their civil war, the ultimate blame is laid on Israel?
 
 
Yup.

They would be israeli unless they decided to live in the palestinians state permanently in which case they would have palestinians sovereignty!

.....

Oh yeah, just remembered (thanks to abu) that israel should ONLY pay compensation if the arab states pay compensation for the 3/4 million jews displaced from their homes in 1948! More than likely the reparations will be cancelled out (even though israel is owed more - due to a larger number being displaced!)
 
 
It isn't any worse than US or the UK. Which is neither here nor there really.
 
 
I think it's better than the US in many respects. Not sure about the UK.

Why is it that only Israel whos conflict with Palestinians is much smaller, is the only country crtisized and why is it that people seem to forget that these terrorists who flat out say they want to destroy Israel that apprntly Israle is expected to ignore have killed over 1000 Isralei civilians in the last decade? As if Israel is just going out there to kill Palestinians.

I think we all agree that no, of course it wouldn't be ok.

In a similar vane one can't say that atrocities commited by Israel should not be condemned because they are on a much smaller scale than those seen elsewhere.

With regards to being polled as the number one threat to world peace the reason why people think that Israel is a threat to world peace is not because of some anti-Jewish conspiracay or media hype. The fact of the matter is Israel has a 21st Century military but an archaic attitude. The casual way in which it declares war was seen in the conflict with Lebanon. Despite International condemnation (and not just from Arab nations) and calls for diplomacy Israel pounded Lebanon which was hapless to give any sort of proportional response.

The Lebanon war was an atrocity and should be condemned as such and not belittled. It destroyed a country's infrastructure; power and transport with an ugly callousness. It told Lebanese civilians that if they used their vehicles to travel around they were legitimate targets. The result was that in order to collect the wounded ambulances operated at the risk of being targeted.
 
 
But LordSweden, there is a diffrence, the other attrocities tend to be killing civilians for the sake of it. With Israel it is a war, Palestinian groups go in to Kill Israel and kill civilians and also launch ambushes against soldiers. Israel fight back and yes a number of Palestinian civilians get killed in cross fire which as mentioned before has since 2005 been smaller then the number killed by internal conflicts in the Palestinian areas.

Hitler murdered in purpose 6.5 million Jews to erase them from Earth. How could you compare it to a war between 2 countries when one country opens a war on the other one? Your country destroyed complete German cities and killed millions of Germans in the war to protect you.

People like you are the threat to the world's peace. Because people like you are identifying with Islamo-fascists liars who try to force their 1000 night Ali Baba dreams upon others and to steal a land that doesn't belong to them. You are talking out of anti-semite point of view and out of racist point of view!

Where was the UN when he decided to dismantle Hizbullah but didn't do nothing but to watch how Hizbullah is arming itself?

Where was the UN when he watched how Hizbullah is getting more and more weapons?

The UN doesn't care if Israel is gonna be destroyed tomorrow, the world doesn't care about the Jews. Where were the world in the Holocaust? 6.5 million Jews were betrayed by their European "friends" who sent them to the Gas chambers. The UN is an anti-semite organization.

Why when your country is under attack you have all the rights to kill and to destroy your enemy but Israel doesn't? Ha? Maybe because you think that Jews shouldn't defend themselves and that they should live in your European Ghettos.

 You should watch that interview. 

 I guess you are another knight of double standard.

How is opposing war crimes being anti-semitic? Most of the people in Israel are khazars anyway, are they not? They are not true semites, ergo the term anti-semitic in reference to anything critical of israel is misleading. You know some semites are arab...right? Your cries of racism to those who oppose butchery are spitting upon the memory of those who truly suffered such persecution. The fact that to you its nothing more than a concept that you can choose to invoke whenever your narrowminded views are challenged, speaks volumes about you.

Sorry but what do the massive deaths in world war II have to do with justifying the numerous Israeli INVASIONS of lebanon and palestine?

Any sane person can see the atrocities committed by ALL nations in war are a warning to us all on the true nature of power and the way in which patriotism can be perverted into the war chant.

Your just another apologist for mass murder.

You should remember who founded Israel and who, to this day, is wielding Israel like a fingerpuppet. If you think they give two sh*ts about you and your family, your sadly mistaken.
 
 
The standard definition of "anti-semitic" is "anti-Jew" in practically all contexts in which it is used, whatever the historic meaning of "Semites". Arguments about anti-semitism based on the fact that Arabs are semitic peoples too are pure sophistry.
 
 
Perhaps I was being pedantic?

Perhaps I was simply pointing out the inconsistencies inherent to his hate filled rant.

Invasion to Lebanon? So it's ok for the enemies of Israel to send their death squads to kill Israeli babies in the Kibutzim in the north of Israel, it's ok for the enemies of Israel to kidnap and to injure Israeli soldiers in the territory of Israel and it's ok for them to fire missiles at Israel but it's not ok for Israel to fight back and to destroy Lebanon?

Nobody invaded to "Palestine". There's no such thing as "Palestine". And the only mistake was when Israel gave Gaza to the "Palestinians" more than one year ago for the Palestinians to use the places that we left as bases to launch their rockets at Israel  and to burn the synagogues that we left there (video)  while they barbaric human animals were screaming: "Today Gaza, tomorrow Tel Aviv."

You obviously didn't read that far in to the article, because i distinctly read that it's OK and acceptable to criticise israel, and to so would be wrong (because even as a very strong zionist, i'm fully aware israel isn't perfect!) What IS wrong is taking the israel-palestine conflict out of context.

There is NO genocide! More palestinians were killed by Jordan in 1971 than israel ever has! Look at what's happening in Darfur - now THAT's a genocide! Yet there are around 2/3 less google link to a 'darfur genocide' than there are to a 'palestinian genocide'!

 
With regards to being polled as the number one threat to world peace the reason why people think that Israel is a threat to world peace is not because of some anti-Jewish conspiracay or media hype. The fact of the matter is Israel has a 21st Century military but an archaic attitude.
 

To be truthful, i'd say it was more to do with ignorance and the propaganda tactics of 'making israel out to be the one state on earth that has caused all the worlds problems' working, but....

 
The casual way in which it declares war was seen in the conflict with Lebanon. Despite International condemnation (and not just from Arab nations) and calls for diplomacy Israel pounded Lebanon which was hapless to give any sort of proportional response.
 

It did NOT go to war casually. Hizbollah were building up their rocket arsenal from the very day israel left lebanon in 2000 and had been firing rockets (fairly regularly) into the very northern towns of israel for a fair while before July '06! The killing and kidnapping soldiers and sending MORE rockets was a final straw, israel couldn't be in such a vulnerable position and needed to sort hizbollah out!

 
The Lebanon war was an atrocity and should be condemned as such and not belittled. It destroyed a country's infrastructure; power and transport with an ugly callousness. It told Lebanese civilians that if they used their vehicles to travel around they were legitimate targets. The result was that in order to collect the wounded ambulances operated at the risk of being targeted.
 

Well, as hizbollah made the battleground the towns and cities of southern lebanon, this is what israel fought. Yes, it was very sad and distressing to hear the lebanon was being ripped apart and YES, israel could have been a bit more careful when it came to bombing but overall, i definitely believe (having looked at lots of evidence) that it's hizbollah' fault that there was so much carnage, not israels!

Its not our fault, its their fault...

Its just the same BAA BAA mentality that led to events like the holocaust in the first place. Nazi Germans thought their invasion of Poland was justified....Poland attacked them first...Adolph said so.

Theres no such thing as Palestine? Eh? What about al-Ard al-Muqaddasah? Why does Israel exist...because Britain said it should?

Our elite have always wanted a foothold in the strategically vital holy land. That goes back to the crusades. I repeat, Israels government is part of the same global banking empire that controls the US, UK, EU, UN, IMF, WTO, WB... Its a sick happy family. I hope you enjoy being drawn into one of their many manufactured conflicts.

Did I say I support terrorism against Israel? No. I do support lebanese citizens taking up arms to defend their country against a ground invasion by Israeli military units though. Just as I would have stood on the beaches if Germany had invaded during world war II...had I been alive! A third of the victims of this latest war....with no real cause...were children. WTF do you expect to happen when Israeli military invades?

Your assuming everyone on the planet has to "pick a side" in your "great war"... I want nothing to do with your war. Hell, its not even YOUR war...it was handed to you like a pair of old boots. Wake up. Real heroes advocate peace, understanding, dialogue.... You sound like some redkneck in vietnam banging on about "*****in up some gooks", its pathetic.

Well actually my ancestors were worshipping nature in groves and casting children into bogs. So deep was their understanding of creation that everyone from the Romans to the Byzantine emperors would travel to Britain in order to study with the druids, even though in many respects they were sick people. But then again, so were most ancient cultures...including your own. The Romans conquered your lands without breaking a sweat. It took them how long to conquer Albion? Even then we revolted on a regular basis and burnt entire cities to the ground. Think what you like, originally our culture was proud and holistic, though not "civilised" by any means.

Later, as your culture was being herded around the middle east under complete oppression....we were building some of the greatest wonders architecture has ever known. The gothic cathedrals. Your race (if you are truly of jewish descent...and not khazar) have always been cast from the region. Its a very sad story, but it is in no sense a justification for actions the israeli government commits today. Why dredge up the past? You really think your race is superior to another? Your a hypocrite! You were branding people racist a minute ago!

Why are you seeking to insult my own culture? I`m not proud of my countries history! We`ve been responsible for some of the most perverse, masochistic acts in human history. The british invented concentration camps don`t forget! I don`t have a brainwashed rose tinted view of my own country. Unlike yourself. Most of the people in Israel did not support the invasion of Lebanon, same with the invasion of Iraq. Real Israelis want peace, not more bloodshed, not more instability in the region. Who gains? Only rich old men, thousands of miles away, reaping oil profits, weapons profits etc.

You bang on about temples and solomon as if its somehow still relevant. We`re all connected, yahweh and allah are the same God are they not? Whats wrong with you?  

I do NOT associate the israeli people with the actions of its government. I do however despise those such as you, who seem to feel proud of the bloodshed and suffering. Self righteousness at its worst.

*edit BTW  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4580139.stm 

Seriously, do you get sat down with your eyes pinned open and made to watch crazy videos with flash screen imagery and whirling patterns, whilst scientists administer psycho-tropic drugs? You sound like a real convert...you sound like a terrorist tbh. Promising bloodshed in support of your outdated ideology...theres not so much difference between you and the "islamo-fascists".

Don`t get pedantic. It was obvious I was trying to point out that the situation is more complicated than the black and white perspective presented by face of jacob. That the idea of jews Vs arabs is ridiculous.

Do you ever have a decent point or do you just sit in the background tossing cynical crap into the debate, whenever you can think of something suitably asinine of course.
 
 
Something funny happened today, i got neg repped, being told "your sig infuriates me" so apprntly my recognising of Israel as a state and not supporting the terrorist groups that attack it, is making someone angry.

It was obvious what Jacob's use of anti-semitism implied in first place, your response spoke volumes about your agenda. You've already shown yourself completely prejudiced about Israel, and people constantly have to correct your untruths.
If I wanted to see something asinine I would visit the website you recycle this crap from.
 
 
I`m not even going to dignify that with a response....actually I just have.  
 
 
The reason these groups resemble the nazis so much is because their forfathers calaborated with the Nazis. They where killing jews since the 1930's, before there was a state of Israel. These groups are the same as neo nazi groups we have in the UK except much stronger due to the fact that in the west the government cracks down on them and in the middle east Iran and Syria nurture them.

The Vatican collaborated far more than any muslims or persians did.

They did not "collaborate" they simply didn`t pick a side because they didn`t want to be part of Europes war. Don`t be so ridiculous, there are more Neo-nazis in eastern europe than there are in the whole of asia and the middle east.

Your simply equating opposition to Israel to being a Nazi.

Untrue. Ask Yawn about this, she seems fairly well versed on the subject. Although yes, catholics were not guilt free in the holocaust, claims that they actively helped the Nazi's are also untrue.

Wrong. Many Middle-Eastern leaders asked Hitler himself to extend the final solution to the region. It wasn't a case of picking a side to be under a protective umbrella.

We're talking about anti-Semites. Can you make the same claim?

Wrronnng. This board has been through this many times. You cannot claim that people in the Middle East are merely opposed to the actions of Israel, nor can you claim that all people in the Middle East are anti-Semites. The claim is that there is a large portion of people in the middle east who fall into each of the two categories. It's not black and white, but the Middle East is hardly a Semite-friendly region.

I hadn't heard that, but I read recently that the surname "Hitler" had entered usage among extreme elements of the PLO. Oh, the irony. As if the Nazis would have differentiated between two types of non-white.

"The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, who was recognized as the official leader of the Palestinians during this period, was a virulent anti-Semite whose hatred of Jews was both religious and racial. He became a close ally and adviser to Adolf Hitler, and an active supporter of the "final solution," the mass murder of European Jewry. In 1940, he asked the Axis powers to settle the Jewish problem in Palestine in accordance with the "racial interests of the Arabs and along lines similar to those used to solve the Jewish question in Germany." He urged Hitler to extend the final solution to the Jewish refugees who had reached Palestine, and he advised Hitler, in 1943, when it was well known what was happening in Poland's death camps, to send the Jews to "Poland, in order thereby to protect oneself from their menace." "

 www.csmonitor.com 

Also, I heard a rumour that Hitler had a great respect for Islam and it's methods of dealing with "undesirables", but I'm guessing that's all it was; a rumour. As you said, Hitler wasn't too chummy with the "brown" type.
 
 
If the Nazis had either won the war or managed to avert destruction some other way, once all the Jews had been gassed or had escaped to the States they would simply have worked their way up the list of "sub-races" until they got bored, probably stopping before they got to Slavs because they were intended for some kind of agricultural slavery out East. There is no reason to suspect that, given the capacity to continue the Holocaust, they would have stopped at Jews.

Agreed, except... I don't think it'd be logistically possible for the Nazi's to run a holocaust program worldwide, or anything near it. Resistance would increase the further the Nazi's managed to push their ideas; the harder they tried, the less they would acheive when applied over a wider scale. A sort of "diminishing returns" operation, if you like.
 
 
I'm not suggesting worldwide. I was thinking more of a situation where they didn't shoot themselves in the foot, and later all four limbs, head and chest, in starting a war. Or one where they were more politically careful and were able to expand Eastwards into the USSR without getting their asses kicked by the Western Allies. Or something.

Either way, what I mean is a middle ground between Allied victory and a Nazi Earth, because in terms of global extermination I believe you're right - it would have been too difficult for them to implement. Just within a European context, though, I don't think it would have taken them very long at all, given the rapidity with which the Jewish population of Germany dropped. 6m dead (well, less than that the earlier one goes, obviously - I believe the death camps were only set up 1943) and probably millions more heading to the US. Apply the same pressures to blacks, Arabs, Asians (such as they were in Germany in those days) and I think that the combination of death and emigration would have brought about the Nazis' racial ideal for their own country very fast.
 
 
Since we're talking about Hitler and how he hates Jews and anyone non-white, let's say for the purposes of argument, Palestinians, the question arises:
Who do the BNP support in this whole thing?
 
 
Israel, apparently:

 http://www.************/columnists/b...2.php?leeId=80 

The URL won't work. The missing bits are B ee e N n P ee dot org dot UK. I find the censorship rather excessive and unnecessary.

They've "moved on in recent years, casting off the leg-irons of conspiracy theories and the thinly veiled anti-Semitism which has held this party back for two decades."
 
 
That's because they've seen the self-styled "Left" (haha) line itself up with the Palestinian cause over the last few decades. Someone once posted a reason why the Left switched sides (consider that in the first half of the twentieth century, "Jew" and "Communist" were almost synonymous slurs in certain parts of Europe), but I can't remember what it was.

Hitler would have supported the palestinians. He had active links to arab terrorists etc.

The BNP would support the Jews for the most part.

How interesting. The forum owners have written some clever code that changes things you write into something else. But they have been very picky and it unlikely they apply it to anything else. But who knows? Anyway whoever takes an interest in these forums and has the power to actually do it could tell us why? Are they "protecting" us, a point of view etc. And if so, what and why?

Well study the ukraine and the cheka/nkvd list of movers and shakers. Not as important historically as Goebbles (their enemy) but much more "successful" if numbers (apart from 6 million) mean a thing.

No wonder "anti-semitic" laws came into being. And, in effect, self serving.
 
 
You realise you're kind of hijacking the thread here? *sighs*

Look dear, if and when I'm bothered on TSR about anything - I take it up with the proper authorities, through the correct channels and I normally find that I receive an answer. Hence I'm generally satisfied. Merry Christmas and Seasonal Greetings to you and let's not have any more of this nonsense.

Bringing this back on topic, re. the Thread Title...No I don't think Israel is so bad.  
 
 
Wow. What a place. Text manipulation, targeted deletion, all for a good cause. But what is it?
 
 
If you have a problem, post in D&D AAM. Taking topics off track is unacceptable.

Is Israel So Bad?

Well, as a state (not as an idea, jewish homeland etc.)....yes.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident 

When you look at what the survivors say, it really does seem they were using a poorly protected boat as target practice. Which sounds crazy...but the fact is, it had been reen reconned five times...they had it marked in the janes, they even knew the name of the ship. Thats the official military timeline from the incident report. Theres even the official complaint made by the survivors when the the US govt refused to pursue the matter...

 http://www.ussliberty.org/report/report.htm 

But to get back to reality, most states are basically run by criminals. History is like crimewatch in text!

WOW just WOW, though honestly it doesnt suprise me all that much that you would belive these theories, since you always show your hate for Israel. I bet your a firm belever of the fact Israel knew about and followed 9/11 before it happened and that it was really mossad that assasinated JFK.

You are a lier you make claims which are not really in the sources your provide, you just hope people wont read them. I mean why exactly would the IDF want to use the U.S. ship as target practice during the middle of a firece war against the arabs? I mean is it really is inconcevable that whilst fighting a war and sinking arab navy vessels, they might hit the wrong one. Hezbolah sunk a civilian ship in the lebanon war, that was apprntly mistaken for a navy ship, but they are still your heros.

Yes of course, because I don`t like the people running the Israeli military, it means I believe Israel is responsible for EVERYTHING...hey...wheres my phone?...MOSSAD!!!  

Its not a theory, would seeing it in its original PDF format remind you its not just some website, its a legal document. Its sources are the US military report. I`ll be trusting the words of the survivors and families over military spokespeople....and so should you!

 http://www.ussliberty.org/report/report.pdf 

You see all the little numbers? thats a source...you`ll see things like the IDF reports, witness testimony etc.

The idea that they did not know what ship it was, nor who it belonged is simply not true. I don`t claim to know why it happened, I`m simply saying, it did.

The israeli military issued no apology, they simply said "Oh well, shouldn`t have been there"... I think thats disgraceful.

Next you attack me for worshipping hezbolah.... eh?! The only support i`ve ever offered was defending your homeland when a military invades for no reason after bombing the sh*t out of your families community. Wouldn`t you?!

Don`t try and drag me into the war you so desperately want to feel part of. You haven`t got a clue! When was your neighbourhood last cluster bombed?

I don`t support either "side", because I refuse to pick! Is that so alien to you? The whole situation is insane and people like you, the ones who mindlessly support this "us Vs them" mentality are the ones who keep it going.

NOW GOOD DAY TO YOU SIR!!!

*adjusts hat....Spins on heel...
 
 
That's odd, because usually Israeli policy is to apologise first and ask questions later. So much so that they have on occasion apologised automatically for events that later turned out not to be their fault.

To be fair, perhaps policy changed between the USS Liberty incident and today.

Either way, may I draw everyone's attention to  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident  ? Thank you.

[QUOTE=The face of Jacob]Hitler murdered in purpose 6.5 million Jews to erase them from Earth. How could you compare it to a war between 2 countries when one country opens a war on the other one? Your country destroyed complete German cities and killed millions of Germans in the war to protect you.

People like you are the threat to the world's peace. Because people like you are identifying with Islamo-fascists liars who try to force their 1000 night Ali Baba dreams upon others and to steal a land that doesn't belong to them. You are talking out of anti-semite point of view and out of racist point of view!

Where was the UN when he decided to dismantle Hizbullah but didn't do nothing but to watch how Hizbullah is arming itself?

Where was the UN when he watched how Hizbullah is getting more and more weapons?

The UN doesn't care if Israel is gonna be destroyed tomorrow, the world doesn't care about the Jews. Where were the world in the Holocaust? 6.5 million Jews were betrayed by their European "friends" who sent them to the Gas chambers. The UN is an anti-semite organization.

Why when your country is under attack you have all the rights to kill and to destroy your enemy but Israel doesn't? Ha? Maybe because you think that Jews shouldn't defend themselves and that they should live in your European Ghettos.

 You should watch that interview. 

 I guess you are another knight of double standard.

I am sad to say that her majesty has not seen it fit to make me a knight of the realm yet, though the monarch did see that our country stood, at times alone, against the Nazis. I agree that, towards the end, there was wanton destruction and many Britain's feel that Dresden was a tragedy. Without our effort and our sacrifice though, there could have been a significantly larger number than 6.5 million Jews killed.

The UN is not an anti-semite organization, as has been widely reported in this thread, it played its part in the creation of Israel. You may cite as many General Assembly resolutions that go against Israel as you like but none of them are legally binding so,for better or worse, are irrelevant.

Israel is a sovereign nation and she has the right to defend against all form of terrorism. People usually get bog down about Palestinians civilians being killed. But given that terrotists and civilians are not mutually exclusive beings, it is just the press dramatising about the whole situation.
I am not Jews or Palestinian, but common sense tells that the majority of Palestians condone terrorism by voting Hamas into power. I think the universal consesus is against terrorism of all forms. So what make Israel' action against those Terrorists different.
 
 
The Massacre at Damour
(31st Anniversary posting)
(one you never heard of beause there was no Jew to blame)

[...]

"....On 9 January 1976, three days after Epiphany, the priest of Damour Father Mansour Labaky, was carrying out a Maronite custom of blessing the houses with holy water. As he stood in front of a house on the side of the town next to the Muslim village of Harat Na’ami, a bullet whistled past his ear and hit the house. Then he heard the rattle of machine-guns. He went inside the house, and soon learned that the town was surrounded.
Later he found out by whom and how many — the forces of Sa’iqa, consisting of 16,000 Palestinians and Syrians, and units of the Mourabitoun and some fifteen other militias, reinforced by mercenaries from Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and a contingent of Libyans.....

Father Labaky telephoned the Muslim sheikh of the district and asked him, as a fellow religious leader, what he could do to help the people of the town. ‘I can do nothing,’ he was told ‘They want to harm you.
It is the Palestinians.
I cannot stop them.' While the shooting and some shelling went on all day, Father Labaky telephoned a long list of people, politicians of both the Left and the Right, asking for help. They all said with apologies and commiserations that they could do nothing. Then he telephoned Kamal Jumblatt, in whose parliamentary constituency Damour lay.
‘Father,’ Jumblatt said, ‘I can do nothing for you, because it depends on Yasser Arafat.’ He gave Arafat’s phone number to the priest.

[...]

""...In all, 582 people were killed in the storming of Damour. Father Labaky went back with the Red Cross to bury them.
Many of the bodies had been dismembered, so they had to count the heads to number the dead. Three of the men they found had had their genitals cut off and stuffed into their mouths.

The horror did not end there, the old Christian cemetery was also destroyed, coffins were dug up, the dead robbed, vaults opened, and bodies and skeletons thrown across the grave yard.

Damour was then transformed into a stronghold of Fatah and the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine).
The ruined town became one of the main PLO centres for the promotion of international terrorism.
The Church of St Elias was used as a repair garage for PLO vehicles and also as a range for shooting-practice with targets painted on the eastern wall of the nave.

The commander of the combined forces which descended on Damour on 23 January 1976 was Zuhayr Muhsin, chief of al-Sa’iqa, known since then throughout Christian Lebanon as 'the Butcher of Damour'. He was assassinated on 15 July 1979 at Cannes in the South of France..."""

Hes no so much trying to counter any claim, as much as showing that every time something happens to do with Israel its all over the news, mean while if its something else then you hardly hear about it.

*half an hour talking about a child killed in gaza* now whilst we wait for our corispondont in another part of gaza, in other news, over the last few months arab milita has killed 400,000 people in the afircan state off.. sorry to break off there but our corospondant is ready "helo reporting from gaza, the arab child that was killed had an unknwon device straped to his waist, The device was removed before Israeli solderis could get to the scene, but i would imagine it was just some kind of toy."

On the contrary.
Please read my posts.. perhaps just the last page on a search.
My posts don't what you say most of the time.

Not to mention this string is an 'apologist' string by nature/Title "Is Israel so bad" begs comparison.
 
 
Answer of title: Yes

And I disagree that if Palestine was invaded by Muslims to form Israel we won't mind. I whole-heartedly condemned the Iraqi assault in Kuwait for example.

Palestine is not bad, it's just defending its rights and it has the right to do so. The statment: "They are performing terrorist actions on our troops" is utterly ridiculous. Notice troops... who illegally assaulted the lands and who don't find a problem in murdering children. One young girl was sniped when she was in school in her class, what did she do.... spreading terrorist ideas in class right?   When you do brutal things like that don't be surprised if Palestinians take action, which is their right.

You think Israel is not bad titanium? The flag you are proudly showing.... the top line represents the Euphrates river in Iraq and the bottom the river Nile in Egypt.... believing that in between should be Israeli territory, isn't that right? Israel is a result of Zionism, and Zionism is oppression. If you say that now Zionists no longer believe in a 'Greater Israel' then what made them 'change' there belief means they could very much change it back to it's original when they feel it is fit to do so.

What is worse and worse is that the Arab governments are appalling and I consider them direct 'agents' of the U.S. who don't do anything without the U.S.'s permission. U.S., the funder and aider of Israel, the cause of Abughreib and Guantanamo disasters, the cause of Iraq's corruption and instability, is actually the enemy. And it doesn't need a genius to figure that out.

Oppressors will do whatever they want, but most importantly they have to be dealt with strictly. When that does not happen, as Israel's case, then it is a bigger problem.
 
 
That's one of the stupidest posts I've ever read. There's anti-historical rubbish, complete ignoring of palestinian terrorism (how anyone can call blowing up buses and cafes "defending rights" I cannot fathom) ridiculous emphasis on one accidental incident, inaccurate and irrelevant meandering about the Israeli flag (that has no bearing on any debate on the issue), circular logic about Zionism. He condemns Israel and yet confesses to me in PMs that his knowledge of the issue is poor. What a berk.

The over-lap between Muslims and vehement Palestine supporters/terrorist sympathisers is laughable.
 
 
No, now I'm telling you... my knowledge in this issue is not as poor as you think.

Ya a sniper shot at a girl's forehead is surely an accident   and that's only an example.
 
 
This the incident where the PA later arrested a palestinian who had been firing nearby? Because that's happened in a similar situation - although only after they blamed Israel of course. See, that's what happens when you give no details or sources of the incident bar accusations - no-one can tell what you're talking about. And yeah, people can get hit in the head by bullets during crossfire - give me one decent reason why it would be in the interests of Israeli soldiers to carry out such an act deliberately? Or why they would want to? Indeed, you cannot and cannot produce a shred of evidence that such a thing was deliberate, even if it was Israeli forces responsible (which you haven't shown). That's the problem with ignorant fools like you - you never bother to analyse and wind up looking like idiots because of it.

And yeah, like most of your sort your knowledge is pathetic at best.

Once the again another of the think they know it all and yet they know nothing people.

Your pearl of wisdome on what the blue stripes represent, WRONG it has nothing to do with the rivers, it represents the simular striped found on the tallit a religious garmant, and emphasizes a connection between Israel and its Jewish roots.

Take a look at all 'zionist regime of opression'

I dont get it why do we sit here mindlessly typing our heads of trying to convinvce ppl that Israel is such and Palestine is such, when we wont change anyones views!

It is a fact that Israel should not exist but does a result of some very bad decisions by some very silly people. and some silly ppl are turning Iraq into the exact same place and somehow trying to blame it on Sunnis'-Shi'ites fighting which is all codswallop. but that is another matter.

As i was saying even the Hamas leader (Hamas the party which were sworn in by the ppl of Palestine only for everyone to oppose them as they are so called terrorists and corrupt! Well the sraeli government ain't as good as they make out it has been rocked with scandals)has been forced to say yes it does exist and he is now asking for his right for a palestine to be formed withou sanctions from the UN bought about mainly by the US.

It would be wonderful everyne in the region lived i harmony ut it will just not happen.

And do you know what is most annoying Fatah and Hamas are at loggerheads themselves. Which is a shame.

I tell you all one thing though if the muslims/arabs got there acts together and stopped fighting each other and actually all got on they would be a force and then if they asked for a palestine it WOULD be formed no matter who opposes it!

In answer to the threads question: Yes.

Ironic that i've sat her and typed loads of stuff which will branded as lies and torn up by my fellow TSR users!

Israel like Iraq was created in the 20th C from Liberated Ottoman Lands.. 99% of which were given to the Arabs.

the Creation of Iraq, willy-nilly by the Brits, was a Mistake in that it grouped 3 Different people into one state instead of making the obvious divsion. Spoils for Arab help.
That promise also post-dates their previous/first promise to the Jews.

Israel, OTOH, was created by a Vote of the UN and did take into consideration these ethnicities to some degree.

Somehow the Arabs will just have to make do.. what with 99% of the land and 100% of the Natural Resources, and an Area and population the size of the USA or EU.
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

 
It would be wonderful everyne in the region lived i harmony ut it will just not happen.
 

and why do you suppose that is since DAY 1 in 1948?

 
Ironic that i've sat her and typed loads of stuff which will branded as lies and torn up by my fellow TSR users!  
 

Not "Ironic"... on some level I'm sure even you knew it was BS.

All these "river to the sea" sigs by Palestinian supporters Unwittingly make the case I think for their unchanging goal. A Judenrein Middle East.

No your mixing up and opinion, a fact is more like the arabs are taking over Africa.

As for silly people blaimg it on Sunnis'-Shi'ites fighting, why is it that Iran is backing both the sunnis abd shi'ites? Its to cause trouble in Iraq why else do you think. that same country funds Hezbolah and Hamas, Hezbolah pays Palestinians to attack Israel. Did you know when unsuccesfull suicidebombers have been caught and questioned, they rearly said anything about fredom for palastine, it was either that their family would get money for it or mostly just about how Allah will reward them, they didnt give a dam about the palestinians they just wanted to by maytrs and have all the rewards in heven.

Oh and ill tell you one thing the arabs will never even get along with each other, they make it out to the outside world that they are united, but there have been many wars between arab states in the last 100 years and theres still huge tension between certain arab states, and forgot what the leaders say if you where to ask the average person on the street, who they hate the most, it wont be jews you hear it will be another arab country.

and another thing you all say you want peace and yet the ideas your 'camp' has of conditions for peace is moving all the Jews to europe. Hey if palestinians should get a right of return to Israel does that not mean the 600,000 jews who got kicked out or arab countries get a right of return? If Israelis as bad people as you like to think, why would the palestinians want to move to Israel.

No. I believe the symbolism of the Israeli flag can be summed up in two words: Prayer mat. Well, "shawl", but I think "mat" is just a generally nicer word despite having a completely different meaning. Mat.  

That's an interesting alternative interpretation though. I'm not being snide or sarcastic here - it really is. It's plausible enough, when you look at the concept of "Greater Israel", and many countries' flags or insignia refer, or have in the past referred, to a "Greater Whatever". Unfortunately, regarding Israel, that interpretation just happens to be completely wrong.

 
Israel is a result of Zionism
 

Correct.
 
and Zionism is oppression.
 

Incorrect.

Oh No,
not another Arab ConspiraCIST
the old "greater Israel' Nonsense
 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel 

"...It has been alleged by some groups that the blue stripes on the Israeli flag actually represent the rivers Nile and Euphrates, which some Zionist thinkers (such as Avraham Stern and Israel Eldad) had claimed as the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael, the land promised to the Jews by God. [7]
Those making this allegation insist that the flag "secretly" represents the desire of Jews to conquer all of the land between the Nile and Euphrates rivers, which would involve conquering and ruling over much of Egypt, all of Jordan, and some of Syria and Iraq. Yasser Arafat also made the allegation, [8] and repeatedly tied this notion to the stripes on the Israeli flag. [9] [10]

Both Zionist and anti-Zionist authors have Debunked the claim that the stripes on the flag represent territorial ambitions. Daniel Pipes notes "In fact, the blue lines derive from the design on the traditional Jewish prayer shawl", [11] and Danny Rubenstein points out that "...Arafat... added, in interviews that he gave in the past, that the two blue stripes on the Israeli flag represent the Nile and the Euphrates... No Israeli, even those who demonstrate understanding for Palestinian distress, will accept the... nonsense about the blue stripes on the flag, which was designed according to the colors of the traditional tallit (prayer shawl)..."[10] Persistent critic of Israel and Zionism Israel Shahak is equally explicit. In his The Zionist Plan for the Middle East he states: (abu note: and Israel Shahak is a Raging Anti-Semite, not just antizionist')
A good example is the very persistent belief in the non-existent writing on the wall of the Knesset of the Biblical verse about the Nile and the Euphrates. Another example is the persistent, and completely false declarations, which were made by some of the most important Arab leaders, that the two blue stripes of the Israeli flag symbolize the Nile and the Euphrates, while in fact they are taken from the stripes of the Jewish praying shawl (Talit).
Saqr Abu Fakhr, an Arab writer, has also spoken out against this idea. He demonstrates that the "Nile to Euphrates" claim regarding the flag is one of Seven Popular Misconceptions and/or Myths about Jews which, despite being Unfounded and having abundant evidence Refuting them, continue to circulate in the Arab world. [12]

Nevertheless, the Hamas Covenant states "After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates," and as recently as January 29, 2006, Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar issued a demand for Israel to change its flag, citing the "Nile to Euphrates" argument. [13]

I don't think you can make such a bold statement without sufficient evidence which you wouldn't be able to produce. To begin with its impossible to assess the motivations of many suicide bombers because the very nature of their attack means they are not around to justify it.

I would also like to ask whether you honestly believe that you or anyone else in the world would sacrifice their lives for financial reward or posthumous prestige ? thats absurd.

 
and forgot what the leaders say if you where to ask the average person on the street, who they hate the most, it wont be jews you hear it will be another arab country.
 

What mysterious source are you gleaning your information from this time. You've argued how diverse the views of Arabs are and then said that you KNOW that they all hate other Arabs over Jews.

 
If Israelis as bad people as you like to think, why would the palestinians want to move to Israel.
 

I would imagine its a hard decision for any Palestinian to move to Israel and be seen to be fraternizing with enemy. if I knew though, that my family would be in danger from Israeli strikes and incursions, faced with terrible prospects and be denied basic freedoms by the Israeli state then I may just sacrifice some dignity and move. It is the oppressive nature of the Israeli regime that forces Palestinians to move to Israel.
 
 
Agent Smith, then how do you justify the previous illegal occupation of Sinai in Egypt for example.

Actualy it wanst illegal, the geniva convention says it is legal as an act of self defence even if its a prempted one. Since Eygpy were threatening to attack and had put 150,000 troops in the siani desert near the Israeli desert, you cant dennie this is a threat to Israel.

Realysing that its own airforce of 200 planes is not going to have an easy time against 900 arab planes in the event of a war, they launched a preemptive strike on the most powerfull arab airforce at the time eygpt. They knowkced out the whole airforce, and when eygpt fought back, then Israel moved forwards in to the Siani desert as this meant the battle was not fought in Israel.

On a seperate note, i would like to ask you something, muslims get attacked a lot in the UK especialy since 7/7, why do muslims despite suffering this feel the need to be anti semetic, no nothing about Israel, im purley talking about attacking Jews. Of course its not the majority of muslims, but the fact that that 2% of the UK population account for the majority of anti semitism in the UK and indeed its not much diffrent in Europe either.
 
 
Hate to break it to you but anti-semitism isn't limited to Muslims. SUPRISE!!

And that is pretty rich since the Talmud is a piece of racist infested crap. Charge me interest because I'm a "gentile" !

**** off and find some polls to back that ridiculous claim.

Israel caught 77 suicide-bombers last year (45 already with the vest/belt on) before they could carry out their attacks, so actually their motivations would be open to discovery and assessment.

Obviously they would, "going out in a blaze of glory" (not that suicide-bombing is any such thing) is an age-old concept. In societies with a strong concept of honour, such as Japan, the concept wouldn't be "absurd" at all - look at Kamikaze pilots. And in the territories, with all the brainwashing, preaching, promises of "72 virgins" and hero-worship of terrorists - there's no doubt that many are motivated by such things.

"Israel is horrible and oppressive, that's why people want to move there!"
I think you'll find that the reason some Arabs are keen to move to Israel is because it is a successful, first-world country with plenty of prospects that treats it's citizens with respect and has rights for women, gays etc. It is not a backwards, death-obsessed cult that puts more value on blowing up foreign civilians than on improving its own basic qualities. In the PA, women are restricted and gays are killed. In Israel women can do what men can and gays can live in peace. It's really not difficult to explain why one would want to move from one to the other - it's the same reason people from Africa seek asylum in the UK.

1. The instruction is not to charge interest to other Jews, not to specifically charge interest to gentiles. You have deliberately misrepresented what is said to make it sound like the Talmud forces Jews to charge interest to gentiles when in reality a Jew would be free to not charge interest to a gentile if he wished.
2. The Koran has a similar statement, does it not? That prohibits Muslims charging other Muslims interest? Which is one of the reasons why you increasingly see banks offering services specifically to Muslims. Not only that, but non-Muslims living in Muslim countries can be forced to pay special taxes simply for not being Muslim. No such thing exists in Israel.
 
 
Can we all keep things on topic and at least give the illusion of respect, please? Thank you.

Hey. Why are you involving us in this? It's your talmud that tells jews to charge interest to gentiles. Muslims can't charge interest. TO ANYONE. Don't switch subjects here.

 
If Israelis as bad people as you like to think, why would the palestinians want to move to Israel.
 

Could it be because their ancestral family land and homes are in Israel?
 
 
It doesn't tell them to. It permits them to.

And regarding the second point, since when does having an ancestral home somewhere mean you have to live there? Not all Jews upped sticks and headed for Israel in 1948, not by a long chalk. Not all American-Irish want to return to Ireland at the earliest opportunity, and not all Mexican immigrants are glad to be forcibly thrown back across the border.

You do realise that continuing to repeat something that is false once you have been informed that it is false is lying, right? Then again, you have no qualms about brazenly lying, so it's expected. As I said before, Jews are not told to charge interest to gentiles, they are told not to charge interest to Jews. Big difference.

Is that so? I guess special dhimmi taxes make up for it.
 
 
I don't think "dhimmi" means what you think it means. I just found the following quote from Muhammad, which caused me some surprise: "Whoever harms a dhimmi has harmed me." Laying aside the fact that Jesus had copyright on the concept of "if you did it to them, you did it to me", and that Muhammad was therefore clearly in breach of copyright law, that doesn't really sound like second-class citizen material to me.
 
 
Sadly the actual laws regarding them doesn't come close to treating them the same as Muslims.

A dhimmi was a "free" (i.e. non-slave), non-Muslim subject of a state governed in accordance with sharia — Islamic law. A dhimmi is a person of the dhimma, a term which refers in Islamic law to a pact contracted between non-Muslims and authorities from their Muslim government. The status of dhimmi was one of legal and social inferiority, and applied to millions of people living from the Atlantic Ocean to India from the 7th century until modern times.

That's the beginning of the wiki article.
 
 
So you read osmetinh not true and because its anti semetic its suddenly true. Why is it that it is only nazis and anti semetic website you see this on. If you look for quotes from the talmud on any neturla site you will see qoutes such as

"he who takes one life it is as if he has destroyed an entire world and he who saves on life it is as if he has saved the world entire"

"old age is famine for the unleared and the season of harvest for the learned"

but because a nazi tells you that the talmud is racist, you belive him. Theres such an odd yet toaly expected trend with extremists and no thats not talking aobut you tibia, but basicaly they take things which are true and pretend they didnt happen e.g. holocause, and take thinks which are fake and pretend they are authentic ie elders of zion.

I had a long convo with Bismarck about this and he admitted it was racist. He even fell into the trap of bringing Islam into it, even though I'm not a Muslim.  

And don't call me a racist for criticising your religion, attacks on religion are fair game.

So ONE jew admits its racist, and THUS it's racist?!

The talmud was written thousands of years ago, when society was different. And yes, i agree many of the things written there (when judged by todays standards) are quite radical and could be seen to be racist/perverted etc. BUT you forget to mention that jewish thinking has moved a long way since. Jews no longer follow the talmud as they did. If you would like to know about contemporary jewish thought on an issue, ask a rabbi....DON'T consult a 2000 year old book written by people in a society so far removed than the one we live in today....

propals always look for biblical things that can make jews look racist. Take this for example, Jews are suposed to rest on the Shabat, from sundown on friday till sundown on saturday. Well as you can imagine in Israel those who wish to observe the shabat do so and those who dont dont. There is no law in Israel to say that one must observe it. The bible says Jews must observe it and makes no refrence to non jews.

Well the propals say this is racism since the bible says Jews must rest on this day, non jews are allowed to work. Imagine if Israel passed a law now saying all non vital workers must observe the shabat, including muslims. there would be an out cry over Jews forcing their beleifs over others, and yet the propals use the fact that Jews dont try and force their beleifs over everyone else as a way of saying they are racist.
 
 
D&Ders...please can we try to have a discussion without resorting to slinging around insults like they're going out of fashion?

I know that emotions are heated and that we're discussing all matters under the sun - many of which are very personal to some people here. Hence - how much more so to show at least a modicum of respect?
Most of you have been here long enough to know each other's true opinions - yes we all know that many of you vehemently disagree and dislike each other. But can we contain that behind a facade of civility and basic good D&D style?

You don't have to be nice to each other - just stop all the swearing and constant flaming.
Pretend that you're fairly intelligent people currently in/going to university and you have the ability to hold a debate for more than six posts before degrading into a verbal mud-slinging match. PLEASE!

Huh? Sorry, i think ive missed something. I don't understand.

Are you saying that people have asserted that because jews shouldn't work on shabbat that the torah is racist? Or are you saying that people have said that israel has a law that imposes the shabbat on everyone?

Which part of the description of what a dhimmi is, contained on that page, is inaccurate? And actually, that opening paragraph which I cited comes from SIX different sources (if you read the footnotes you'd know that). Are they ALL "Jews who hates muslims"? Mefager.
Or is the fact that there is a Jew cited in the whole article and that renders it "corrupt" in your eyes? Seriously, your inability to construct arguments and general idiocy is beyond a joke.

They call it racist because it forbids Jews working on shabat (unless its needed in oder to save a life as this is seen as a mitzvah) but does not mind if non jews are working on shabat out of their own choice.

There has never been any talk about introudcing such a law, im simply brought it in to show how if there was such a law it would be seen as a breech of peoples fredom and yet the lack of such a law is called bieng racist, so what exactly do they expect Jews to do. Muslims and Christians both have a day of rest and yet Jews are not criticized for having one.

Its never been a major criticism, but the fact that people have done so just shows how absurd some of the stuff are.

The Talmud is the Oral Law and should be taken just as, if not more, literally than the Torah (Written Law) since it expands upon the Torah and clarifies reasoning. The Talmud contains laws and is the blueprint for Jewish life, not just a reference. This is the Orthodox view anyway, AFAIK.

Fair enough. Out of interest, what don't you agree with?
 
 
There's always so much talk of the israeli army and government, but there'd probably be more negatives about their citizens [specifically those who reside in the illegal settlements]. It seems even the army are scared of those, and the press are frightened to their bones to do any reports near them. These "residents" can do whatever they like to the Palestinians, it seems. Who will stop them? No-one.

It's like a life and death situation to be recording inside israel, at these scenes, which makes sense when there is so little media coverage on israel, in israel.

Of course, it's not all israelis, before someone replies with "yeah but not all israelis are bad".
 
 
Unsupported rubbish. When the Israelis moved out of the areas last year or whichever year it was, there were hundreds who were born there, made an honest living and left peacefully (Just for the Palestinians to destroy every remaining trace unless they could use it themselves). These are innocent people caught in apolitical crossfire for the most part.

How do you think anyone would be able to properly? I already stated how and why there is so little media coverage on these things.

It's true that innocent people are caught up in this, like I said at the end of my post. Alot of israelis are given incentives by the government to move into these [illegal] settlements; a house is normally worth half it would cost in other places. However, there are the extremist lot who don't need government incentives to live there, they live there to make Palestinian lives hell, and the army do **** all about it.

ALSO, i feel sometimes that all the safety barriers that are put round the laws just aren't relevant (to me, anyway).

I mean (to give a stupid example), if i want to eat a chicken burger with cheese on it, i don't see why i can't? Chicken does NOT produce milk and thus i feel that taking what is said in the torah as 'Though shan't cook a animal in it's mothers milk' to mean you can't eat milk and chicken together (even though chicken's do NOT produce milk) is kinda taking it a step too far.

It's a stupid example, but that sort of thing

There may be reservations but only as much sense as the UK media occasionally refrains from reporting something, so that they don't offend (e.g.) Muslims.....

They aren't prohibited from reporting on anything and if they had the guts to stop caring who they offended, they'd show it all! Even though they show a considerable amount now! Most of the israeli press (and rightly so, IMO) oppose settlement expansion!

Hmm..

Interesting, because you think the talmud doesn't completely apply to modern living; and so therefore not a religion for "all time". Therefore you probably wouldn't have converted and will go to hell.

Shomer Negiah is ostensibly "stupid" but it really isn't. It's just so logical. I have a good book on it - The Magic Touch. Wanna borrow it?  

So it might appear to be pointless but it's the law. If you believe in G-d and you believe that G-d gave the Torah then you won't find it stupid. *shrug*

It's not even that media is filtered, the press are attacked or told to leave when trying to report in such areas. So there are little reports in the first place, to even reach the BBC (for example).

I agree, the israeli press are slowly starting to express criticism of israel, but even then, it is always a small amount. It is only a very small minority that do speak out, and to get their voices heard in the media is very hard. That said, there's probably more media criticism of israel in israel than in the US ^o)

That is utter bull. The Israeli media is, and always has been, just as watchful and critical of the Israeli government as that of other Western countries and their governments. The Israeli media scene is full of diverse opinion and heated debate and is praised as such by media monitoring organisations. You only need to pick up an Israeli paper or turn on Israeli TV to see many different opinions and strong criticisms and analysis of events in Israel. There is tremendous coverage on Israel, inside Israel. The 2005 Reporters Without Borders report called the Israeli media "independent" and "robust" (get a dictionary). The self-analysis of the Israeli media is unquestionable, and it has far more in common with Western media than that in the repressive dictatorships of the region. You are, as usual, talking complete unmitigated crap. Your utter ignorance, and yet willingness to spew forth, is unbelievable.

As I said, it's not a frequent thing. Sure it happens.

This is what I'm talking about.

Oh Farhan, stop pitying us with thoese ridiculous photos. I've not even read a word of your posts on this thread but I recognose those from the Palestinian Society where you posted them a few weeks ago. FFS, they're so pathetic it's hard to identify which caption goes with which picture! It makes no sense. One has to be extremely deluded to actually believe this. The second one for example, yeh that looks TERRIBLE. Those EVIL Israelis. "Shouting" at a photographer - haha, he isn't even shouting. He's pointing with a rather worried look on his face.

Give me STRENGTH.

Yep, I had to dig them up.

It's hard to post more credible photos/videos of that sort of thing on here because it's not forum material.

Yes, those evil israels, carrying guns and throwing stones, and what not. How.. so.. innocent and nice, and playful. They're an example.

From your propaganda database.

So you resort to posting uncredible photos.

And they're throwing stones at what, exactly? Are the settlers with the guns shooting anyone? No. What's your point?! They're completely out of context and prove NOTHING. Grow up.

So it might appear to be pointless but it's the law. If you believe in G-d and you believe that G-d gave the Torah then you won't find it stupid. *shrug*[/QUOTE]

I believe g-d gave the torah and that MOST of the fences that were very relavent at the time and still are, i just think that some were relevant then but aren't so now....

WTF? So you think they're carrying guns for the sake of it? Because carrying guns and not doing anything with them, is cool or something?! Throwing stones at.. nothing?!

   

What're your views on israeli civilian violence toward neighbouring Palestinian homes?
 
 
As far as i'm aware....all jews go through some sort of retribution for up to a year before they reach heaven! The length of time they stay in 'hell' depends on the number of sins they have committed.

People speculate that this retribution will be making souls watch/experience all sins and it is the embarrassment caused by the person having committed them....

What're they throwing stones at? You can't see. How stupid. That's my point. Even if they are actually throwing stones into Palestinian territory, that doesn't change the fact that the photo itself has zero credibility. I'm not getting at the content but the lack of context and lack of reliability.

How do I know? How do you know? Nobody knows because it's a photo which looks at time for a split second and nobody can possibly know what happened before or after. How do you know the scenario? What if they were forced to come out their house, armed, because their home was being attacked? What if they carry guns anyway? Why did they feel the need to carry the guns? Who says they were using it to kill? So because you see Jew + Gun you think it = killing + Palestinian. Nooooooo. Wrong answer. Better luck next time.

Israeli violence towards Palestinian homes is wrong. Just as it's wrong when the Palestinians throw stones and fire rockets into Israeli homes. You don't need to post your pathetic pictures to prove that because it just makes you look stupid. They have no credibility whatsoever and they only prove your inability to construe a decent argument (and thereby having to post useless pictures instead).

Anyone getting déja-vu here? *sigh*

Then you're Reform.

EDIT: oh that one. Didn't see that.

If you be a good boy and you're a non-Jew and follow the 7 Noachide Laws then you've got a place in the world to come, just as a Jew has who follows the commandments in the Torah.
 
 
And if you're the scum of the earth/rapist/murderer ? What happens to you ?

I suppose that depends how you class which strand of judaism one belongs to?

By ethnicity i'm most certainly orthodox but if by my opinions i'm reform, so are a large majority?

Would you say that anybody who is not shomer negia (thus don't agree with all the 'fences' around the law) are technically reform?
 
 
They have no one to blame but themselves and that little terror state they call a homeland. That latest attack on Lebanon did much harm to their causes, it exposed the true zionist ideal a bunch of bomb dropping, murdering sods who tuck tail and run when they begin to take casualties themselves. Then Hezbullah continues to exist and train new members for their cause making them stronger and more of a threat than ever to israel. The jews cut their own throats.

It's a stupid example, but that sort of thing

 

If it were based purely on the Written Torah then yes it would be. However, the extrapolation from that to separation/not eating milk and meat together are derived from the Oral Law where it states as so.
Hence it's not such a huge leap - as there's stepping stones in between.

Being 'Reform' and 'not keeping shomer negiah' are two completely different things. It's like comparing apples to a motorbike. You just can't do it.

And - don't read the Magic Touch. It's a book of fluffy-filled bull**** - complete cr*p. I actually wanted to be sick when I read it.

You're defs not Reform. Not with that opinion. Heck no.
That's more Conservative.

It's like a life and death situation to be recording inside israel, at these scenes, which makes sense when there is so little media coverage on israel, in israel.

 

Something stops you from understanding the above post, and why the media is unable to cover these things.

Shame on you.

Or maybe she just went offline because her life doesn't revolve around TSR.  

If you're the 'scum of the earth' and have committed murder etc then you will go to Gehennom which isn't exactly hell as we know it, i.e. no brimstone and physical torture like the many connotations of hell people have. It's more a spiritual repair. But if you've committed such major sins then there is no way that even after spiritual repair you have a place in the world to come. I mean this subject is open to an awful lot of speculation, there is no definite answer. I have written a 3000 word essay on it and it's quite hard to explain it within a paragraph.

Urm, hold on. I've only seen that question asked once and that was when I already went offline. The other two I answered, though the second one I didn't see until you brought it up again because of so many other replies. I wasn't avoiding the question; why would I want to do that FFS? I don't have a lot of time and I'm not going to scrutinize every thread for a post that might contain a question from you.

What on earth is your point? There are five posts there with three separate questions in. Therefore, only two are repeats. One I didn't see and one I was offline for. It's not as if you had to repeat the SAME question five times.  
 
 
Actually it was 2 very similar questions which wern't answered to a decent degree. I asked what happened to "bad" people when they die. Not an idea which is exactly hard to grasp, darlin'. Forget it.

If you want to know the answer I suggest you dig up your hero Arafat.

As to what happens to Gentiles when they die?
The same thing that Happens to Jews and Muslims.. Dust.
No more. No less.

anything else?

That is my "Jewish Perspective".

You see, most Jews are SECULAR while most Muslims are Not. So I can give you, in fact, the Majority 'Jewish' opinion, if not the Orthodox one. (we have Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and just plain old Cultural Jews like me) while....

Manji:
The trouble with Islam today is that literalism is mainstream.

Even moderate Muslims take the Koran as the final word of God: unfiltered, unchanged and unchangeable.
This supremacy complex inhibits us from asking hard questions about what happens when faith becomes dogma. Such a path can lead only to a dead end of more violence...

Sorry
I know your life on this forum is empty semantic-bluff and chit chat, so I really won't waste any more time on you putting content and thought into posts.
Really, there are so many others who do the same here. Nothing.
Just heel-nippers- non-contributors who think they are clever but are transparently empty.

have a nice night

I asked a serious question and got a less than serious response from you; and then you have the balls to say I post "semantic-bluff" ? You are very strange.

People think Hitler is evil because of films like "Hitler: The Rise of EVIL " but they are made by jews  99% of the time  who have a reason to think Hitler was evil - he rounded them up and tried to deport them from Europe and was alleged to have made them into lampshades, light switches and other daft lies.

It's sad and cruel that the whole world takes the propaganda about Hitler and the Nazis as written by their enemies as historical fact. If you get your history from TV and the movies expect to be wrong once in a while.

You're Jewish? Ooh. Why haven't you joined J-Soc then! Tut.

Can I just add, just because the Orthodox opinion isn't the majority opinion, it doesn't mean it's not the right opinion. The majority opinion is based on more secular beliefs and isn't traditional Judaism based on the book like Orthodox Judaism is. Just because the majority of Jews aren't religious it doesn't mean they are right. Just to clarify for anyone; it can get quite confusing at times.

I highly doubt that the Israeli interrogation manages to truly find the motivations behind a suicide bombing. By choosing to become a suicide bomber you have signified such a hatred of a country/regime/ideal that you are unlikely to just open up your heart to them.

We all know why it always comes to this; Because the truth is so glaringly obvious, yet the pro-zionist side will not concede defeat (obviously they are going to stand up for themselves), despite all the evidence against the terrorist state.

When the truth is so obvious it usually comes down to arguments, because one side knows they are totally correct, and the other knows they are totally correct (yet wrong).

That was so obvious im not sure why i even bothered to write it down

Israel is a terrorist state because it vigerously defends it's existence and doesn't allow itself to be destroyed despite consistent attack by hostile enemies, enemies that hide behind their own civilians and fire rockets into Israeli civillian areas? Or is Israel a terrorist state because of the JOOISH CONPIRACY TO HIDE TEH SECRET MOON BASES!!!!!!!111one
