Sugar beets are back in northern Colorado in a
big way.

Earnings are up, production is high and Richard Seaworth -- a
second-generation sugar beet farmer near Wellington -- is happy.

"This is the best sugar beet crop we've ever had here," said
Seaworth, whose family works 600 acres.

He and the Western Sugar Cooperative said a variety of factors
have boosted this fall's harvest, including a season of ideal
growing conditions in Colorado and damaging weather in India that
wiped out much of its sugar cane crop.

That prompted many countries to become importers of sugar from
the United States. This will help produce good payouts to many of
the 300 Colorado members of the Western Sugar Cooperative, said
Mike Otto, senior agriculturist with the co-op.

"This is a very good year, and it will make a little money and
help farmers remain in business," Otto said.

The Western Sugar Cooperative was formed in 2002 out of about
1,000 sugar beet growers in Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming and
Montana.

This year, about 39,700 acres of sugar beets were harvested in
Colorado, up from 31,700 last year, Otto said.

Farmers are still awaiting the final payout tally for this year,
but in Wellington, payments to co-op members are projected to reach
$3.2 million this year, up from $1.6 million in 2008, he said.

"It will allow a lot of them to pay some bills," Otto said.

A relatively cool and wet spring and summer helped the sugar
beets, which also were spared high winds and late freezes.

Seaworth also was quick to point out that new techniques --
including genetically modified seed -- also helped. The seeds make
for stronger, more disease-resistant plants.

"It's a classic case of science and nature working together,"
Seaworth said.

Seaworth said there was little argument about the modified
seeds' effectiveness. "We've outperformed every expectation," he
said.

Still, he didn't see sugar beets attaining the same stature they
enjoyed in the early 1900s. Sugar-refinement technology helped
produce sugar factories in just about every town and city in
northern Colorado.

But falling sugar prices in the 1970s -- and the sale of Great
Western Sugar Co. in 1974 -- along with foreign competition led to
sugar's collapse in Colorado.

Fort Morgan remains the only operating sugar beet-processing
factory among the original 14 Great Western Sugar plants.

But this fall's harvest gives Seaworth hope that he and his son
can remain in the sugar beet business. "We're not going to take a
year-long cruise," Seaworth said, "but at least we can keep
things up around here and pay our bills."
