Is in all the press.  Florentino has brought very good players, but
would they play well together?.

Would they make a team?

Will Ingeniero Pellegrini deliver?  He has been quite successful in
Chile, Argentina and at Villarreal.

And I have this feeling that Kaka is the key and the most clever
player in this Real Madrid.

But Madrid is "puro cachondeo", a permanent fiesta.  Would they
concentrate in playing football.  CR had this incident at a Mallorca
disco a couple of days ago.

He's being tempted to figure as anchor man by several Madrid discos.

Amanecera y veremos.  Dawn will come and we'll see.
