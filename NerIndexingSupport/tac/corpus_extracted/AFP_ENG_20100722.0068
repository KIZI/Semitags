Caracas Thursday ordered Colombian diplomats to leave the country and close
their embassy within 72 hours, after President Hugo Chavez severed ties over
allegations Venezuela was harboring Colombian rebels.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro announced the compulsory expulsion of
the diplomats, telling reporters a formal notification had been sent to Bogota.

"We have sent a diplomatic note to the charge d'affairs of the Republic of
Colombia in Caracas saying you have 72 hours to close your embassy and leave the
country," Maduro said.

He added that orders had also been given to close Venezuela's embassy in Bogota
and to repatriate Venezuelan staff.

The Colombian and Venezuelan ambassadors were already in their home countries,
having been recalled in the past few days as the row worsened.

Madura said "other types of decisions in the economic and commercial aviation
areas were being evaluated to protect Venezuela, to defend the dignity of our
country." He did not elaborate.

The diplomatic orders came immediately after Chavez announced he was cutting
ties with Colombia over Bogota's allegations that Venezuela was serving as a
rear base for Colombian leftist rebels.
