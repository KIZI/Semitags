NFL Week 5,Wahington Beat Packers In Overtime,16-13

Let's start discussing......
 
 
Arizona upsets New Orleans. tampa bay beats cincinnati.
 
 
What was the score of the Redskins/Packers game?
 
 
 
What was the score of the Redskins/Packers game?

 

16-13 in OT i believe.
 
 
That Redskins/Packers game was pretty good, but I was mostly watching the Indy/Chiefs game... Colts won by like 10 but they weren't looking too good, or at least as good as they're supposed to be. Don't tell Echo I said that.

Being a Washington Redskins fan, I think it's a good day in Mudville... Skins win. Also to make it an even better day, Dallas lost (again). I'm a happy camper.

A Packers loss is a Bears gain.  

Bears re-shuffled their offensive line with good results. Stand-in QB got the job done.
I guess Cutler's head is still spinning.
 
 
dallas loses again. so much for home super bowl.

of course they're overrated. tony romo is overrated. What does he have on his resume besides fucking Jessica Simpson and Carrie Underwood?
 
 
Can't make excuses for the Packers, but three starters bit the dust again today, including Clay Matthews, who making McNabb eat dirt until Matthews went out.

Rodgers has a concussion.
 
 
I shut the game off when he got picked, which is evidently the play where it happened.
 
 
Anyone know if Dallas lost?
 
 
Giants kick some butt for the second straight week.

Dallas loses again.....all is well in the world

And Greg Jennings caught two whole passes!

Damn near the entire starting team is going to be on IR by week 8, at this rate.
 
 
Peyton Manning didn't have his best game, yet the Colts still went on to beat the only undefeated team left in the NFL. No team since 1970 has NOT been undefeated after 4 weeks of football, now there are no undefeated teams left.

The Bears game was on at the same time, so I got to watch some of that on another T.V.-Bears are looking good !

at least their defense is.
 
 
Nevada sportsbooks continue to clean up. Pro handicapper Steve Fezzik went 0-5 in week 5. He's the back to back winner of the Las Vegas Hilton SuperContest.

Eags won w/o Vick. That's a good thing.

What I don't understand is how the NY Giants defense has been playing so well the last two games?
 
 
I got eliminated from my Survivor Pool this week. I had three teams and now I'm gone.

I really, really suck.
 
 
Steelers didn't play, so I really couldn't give a shit.. other than the 'Skins game.
 
 
Only 4 favorites covered in week 5. On parlay cards, the hold (or win) percentage for the sportsbooks averages only 30% for an average Sunday.
Yesterday, the hold for the books was 70%! When alot of 'dogs win, parlays get knocked out.
I can't even put a 3-teamer together......

I'd take Carrie Underwood over some glorified piece of metal I wear on my finger

I played my first spread yesterday in like 6 years.

I teased Philly/SF and Indy/KC, made a quick hunge.

Let's start discussing......

 

The Dallas Cowgirls lost AGAIN.This time to the Titans at home no less.       Doesnt look like jerry Jones is going to get to see his team play in the superbowl this year in his stadium like he badly wants.   He has already given Wade Phillips the dreaded vote of confidence which is the ultimate kiss of death.Expect Phillips to be fired before the year is over.  

I never could believe Jones was stupid enough to hire him in the first place.whats Phillips ever accomplished as a head coach before? nothing.He had never won a playoff game before last year and that was against the lameduck Eagles who came in flat with no energy and laid the ultimate egg.

Expect the Vikings to do the same thing tonight against the jets.

only way the cowgirls get to see the super bowl is if they BUY tickets
 
 
 
Hope Favre fails. It'd make this weekend one of the best of the year.
 
 
Nice pick Fav Ray. You suck.

he just did. another pick-six. It's what separates him from Montana and Brady.
 
 
Sweet....  

Sorry, Favrerereeerrrer....lol
 
 
The Housechez avy stays up for another week!
 
 
 
Nice pick Fav Ray. You suck.

 

as usual,when the game is on the line and he has a chance to win the game,he has a brainfart and throws the game ending interception to cost the team the game just like he did last year in the NFC game against the Saints..
