South Korea's national pension fund will lower its investment in the domestic
equity market this year, while increasing the investment portion in the bond
market, the fund said Tuesday.

According to the National Pension Service (NPS), it revised its investment plan,
with the equity investment ratio lowered to 15.2 percent from its earlier target
of 17 percent.

The investment plan for bonds is upgraded from 69.3 percent to 72.1 percent, it
added.

The NPS currently stands as the nation's largest institutional investor and
posted a loss worth 472 billion won (370.5 million U. S. dollars) in 2008.
