whippeeeee 4-3.

What a close match and the umpires gave all the weird decisions they humanly could. Australia scored an early goal in the 1st 10 mins, pak equalized, then the Ausies scored again, Pak equalized and immediately another by the Ausies.

Pak took the lead with two quick goals.

Then came the Australian all out attacks. For 20 mins, Australia kept attacking, with some super saves by the Pakistani goal keeper. Then over some stupid stick foul, which at the most should've warranted a green card if not a free hit, Umpire Curren gave a yellow forcing Pak to play with 10 players on the field. To make matters worse he gave a wrong Penalty corner.

In a do or die effort the Pakistan just threw themselves at the incoming ball. Sealing the fate of the finals, Pak wins!

Oh and I'm talking about Hockey... Field hockey.
 
 
It was a great match Asim, you should have been here in Amsterdam to celebrate  

Pakistan Rules!
 
 
Whats up with the umpiring man? Hockey's become such a racist sport, against the subcontinent teams. We literrally ruled over hockey for about 35-40 years, then they changed all the rules. It drastically affected Indian and Pakistani hockey and only recently we've bounced back.

And that Umpire Curren! Man the Ausies grabbed a Pakistani soldier by his collars and were bout to Punch him and not even a green card. When a Pakistani players stick collides with an Australian player's stick, he directly gets a Yellow card and bam out of the game. Then a wrong Penalty corner shoot out.

Pakistani players have now chilled out, they used to beat up people when they messed with them in the past. The other day I was reading about, an olympics final match way back, when about 10-15 decisions were poorly given against Pakistan, and when the Pakistani players lost the match and got their silvers, one of them went ahead and tied his shoe on the medal and swung it around in protest :D

This whole series saw some freak umpiring!

That was worst umpiring I've seen, but we still managed to win and that matters the most  
Many rules have indeed been changed at the expence of Asian hockey, but we have adapted.

Yeah, remember that, but don't recall the year or city.

Looks like we are adapting football rules, which I personally regret.
 
 
I wish the Pakistani team could keep performing like this consistently. Didn't we like lose recently to like Malaysia. Its like cricket, we can beat the worlds best one day, and the next day lose to the local girls' school team.

Yeah, last week we lost Hamburgmasters 4-3 to Australia.  
Payback time now!  
 
 
The problem with the Pak team is its inability to conserve stamina. Pakistan always attacks in the beginning (although not in this match) vs India, vs Germany our attack got us quick goals. If the overwhelming works, our strategy will work.

If the overwhelming does not work, (like today), we're screwed and tired. In today's contest, Australian control was amazing, but the Pakistanis were just not tiring, like they normally do, even through to the last minutes when Pakistan usually goofs up, the amazing saves by the keeper Akram, were a testament of the over 100% effort put into this game.

Speaking of cricket, saw the back drive, Mudassar gave to score the 4th goal? Right between the Australian keepers legs :D It was such a cricketing shot!
 
 
Congratulation to the Pak hockey team. A deserved trophy.  
 
 
Any one saw the f1 yesterday?stupid montiero it cost us 2 points.But still KIMi rules!!!

I still don't understand what went wrong with India...they did so well last year.
Expect some asses to be sacked soon!

Change in strategy I guess, we kept the pace till the end and were always in control, even when stood behind!
I like it much better this way

The Pak-Germany match was awsome.
 
 
 
The Pak-Germany match was awsome.

 

i like to see the pakistan team play more than indiantem,they play with a fire in the belly,they are awsome.

Indian hockey team...less said better.
 
 
Congratultions, but but but but, do you people still watch HOCKEY ?

Ah, well, I quit watching the idiot box a long time ago.
Some of the soap operas and 24 hour news channels really irritate me.
Not to mention those music channel VJs always trying to look and feel 'cool'
and all that crap.

Nice looking girls dont get to be VJs ?

Don't you???      
You didn't move to a different planet, did you buddy?  
 
 
Mate, my daily dose of the telly could be around ten minutes.
Yeah, that is all.

Devoting anymore time to that idiot box is a utter waste of time, IMHO.
Anything and everything is biased, matches fixed, events dramatised and still you want to watch TV ?

I get a lot of quality content on the internet, relatively speaking.
 
 
Its a good habit Samudra, keep it up. But for good sports matches dude, you have to invest a little time.
 
 
Best wars India and Pakistan fight is at sportgrounds...love those!  
 
 
Whats wrong with you?

Sports is sports, not a war.
At the end of it is just a game played for entertainment and not meant to be a substitute for blood-letting.
Its no wonder that sportsmanship is lost when you defile the game by mixing it with politics.

Get off my back, willya!
Don't even try to turn this back on me. It's a given that sporting events between archrivals are often considered 'war's', football, hockey, cricket or any other major sports!
 
 
add: "In a manner of speaking..."

And chill out.
