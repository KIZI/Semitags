 
 
Is the world getting better?
 
 
In the long run, is the world on an upward or downward trend, or is it going both directions at once? By long run I mean at least the past century or two, preferably longer, say all of known history. If you consider the questions too simple, tell us how. Materially equals econ/law/gov't, health, environment, world peace. Morally equals Hitler, Mother Teresa, Stalin, civil rights, etc.

Oh, Wait - Maybe you are not the late mass-poll-creator. I have but half my mind this evening - my bad.

Oh Damn!! That was a question, wasn't it?

Sh!t...there I went again with the questions, didn't I?

Oh for crying out loud, why must I keep on with the questions? I am going to have to vote multiple times now, aren't I?

Actually this is my first poll ever, and my second thread ever. No problem, though.  

(edit) Make that my third thread. Oops.
 
 
 
WTF.

 

That is intended to be an example of moral deterioration, not improvement. Next example is Mother Teresa, obviously at the other end of the spectrum.
 
 
The world was getting better until Bushitler took office. Then it went to the shiiters. The world will start to improve again once he leaves office. And one day, I will find manbearpig.  
 
 
Can somebody point me to where the world has got worse, either morally or materially, over say the last 200 years?

Materially, larger populations without corresponding increases in productive capabilities has made Africa a worse place to live now than it was 200 years ago (many more people subsisting on substantially less resources). Morally man's capacity for destruction has increased dramatically (we have become much better organized as a species, thus mass murders of various populations/ethnicities are occuring more often and on a larger scale now than they did in the past). Idealogy has been a great motivator for humanity, however human beings being human, has also been a motivator for increasingly destructive acts. I am of the opinion that the world is still populated by human beings. While our circumstances may change, people remain pretty much the same.

As long as you are not saying he is moral that is ok.

Not sure. I think all that has happened is the deaths have moved from infant to later in life. More children (and mothers) survive birth, but die of malnutrition or disease later.

I disagree about the more often statement but certainly there is a greater capacity to kill larger numbers.
I wonder if there's any studies of deaths from warfare as a percentage of population through history? I must have a look....

If you ever watch MTV, you'll find the brain-dead youngsters they interview on the show believe race relations is getting worse in the US (since King's death); our air is more polluted; water is nearly undrinkable; earth is getting warmer; poverty and famine around the world is on the march; and the earth will explode by 2075.

If you've ever read accounts of the turn of the millenia (1000ad) they pretty much thought the same things then as well. They also went around hitting themselves on the head with flat wooden boards as penance so I guess nothings changed much since then

Actually, the odds of dying as a direct or indirect consequence of war is lower now than it has ever been:

EXPLAINING 15 YEARS OF DIMINISHING VIOLENCE.
The End of War?
by Gregg Easterbrook
Post date: 05.19.05
Issue date: 05.30.05

aily explosions in Iraq, massacres in Sudan, the Koreas staring at each other through artillery barrels, a Hobbesian war of all against all in eastern Congo--combat plagues human society as it has, perhaps, since our distant forebears realized that a tree limb could be used as a club. But here is something you would never guess from watching the news: War has entered a cycle of decline. Combat in Iraq and in a few other places is an exception to a significant global trend that has gone nearly unnoticed--namely that, for about 15 years, there have been steadily fewer armed conflicts worldwide. In fact, it is possible that a person's chance of dying because of war has, in the last decade or more, become the lowest in human history.
Five years ago, two academics--Monty Marshall, research director at the Center for Global Policy at George Mason University, and Ted Robert Gurr, a professor of government at the University of Maryland--spent months compiling all available data on the frequency and death toll of twentieth-century combat, expecting to find an ever-worsening ledger of blood and destruction. Instead, they found, after the terrible years of World Wars I and II, a global increase in war from the 1960s through the mid-'80s. But this was followed by a steady, nearly uninterrupted decline beginning in 1991. They also found a steady global rise since the mid-'80s in factors that reduce armed conflict--economic prosperity, free elections, stable central governments, better communication, more "peacemaking institutions," and increased international engagement. Marshall and Gurr, along with Deepa Khosla, published their results as a 2001 report, Peace and Conflict, for the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland. At the time, I remember reading that report and thinking, "Wow, this is one of the hottest things I have ever held in my hands." I expected that evidence of a decline in war would trigger a sensation. Instead it received almost no notice.
"After the first report came out, we wanted to brief some United Nations officials, but everyone at the United Nations just laughed at us. They could not believe war was declining, because this went against political expectations," Marshall says. Of course, 2001 was the year of September 11. But, despite the battles in Afghanistan, the Philippines, and elsewhere that were ignited by Islamist terrorism and the West's response, a second edition of Peace and Conflict, published in 2003, showed the total number of wars and armed conflicts continued to decline. A third edition of the study, published last week, shows that, despite the invasion of Iraq and other outbreaks of fighting, the overall decline of war continues. This even as the global population keeps rising, which might be expected to lead to more war, not less.
In his prescient 1989 book, Retreat from Doomsday, Ohio State University political scientist John Mueller, in addition to predicting that the Soviet Union was about to collapse--the Berlin Wall fell just after the book was published--declared that great-nation war had become "obsolete" and might never occur again. One reason the Soviet Union was about to collapse, Mueller wrote, was that its leaders had structured Soviet society around the eighteenth-century assumption of endless great-power fighting, but great-power war had become archaic, and no society with war as its organizing principle can endure any longer. So far, this theory has been right on the money. It is worth noting that the first emerging great power of the new century, China, though prone to making threatening statements about Taiwan, spends relatively little on its military.
Last year Mueller published a follow-up book, The Remnants of War, which argues that fighting below the level of great-power conflict--small-state wars, civil wars, ethnic combat, and clashes among private armies--is also waning. Retreat from Doomsday and The Remnants of War are brilliantly original and urgent books. Combat is not an inevitable result of international discord and human malevolence, Mueller believes. War, rather, is "merely an idea"-- and a really bad idea, like dueling or slavery. This bad idea "has been grafted onto human existence" and can be excised. Yes, the end of war has been predicted before, prominently by H.G. Wells in 1915, and horrible bloodshed followed. But could the predictions be right this time?

irst, the numbers. The University of Maryland studies find the number of wars and armed conflicts worldwide peaked in 1991 at 51, which may represent the most wars happening simultaneously at any point in history. Since 1991, the number has fallen steadily. There were 26 armed conflicts in 2000 and 25 in 2002, even after the Al Qaeda attack on the United States and the U.S. counterattack against Afghanistan. By 2004, Marshall and Gurr's latest study shows, the number of armed conflicts in the world had declined to 20, even after the invasion of Iraq. All told, there were less than half as many wars in 2004 as there were in 1991.
Marshall and Gurr also have a second ranking, gauging the magnitude of fighting. This section of the report is more subjective. Everyone agrees that the worst moment for human conflict was World War II; but how to rank, say, the current separatist fighting in Indonesia versus, say, the Algerian war of independence is more speculative. Nevertheless, the Peace and Conflict studies name 1991 as the peak post-World War II year for totality of global fighting, giving that year a ranking of 179 on a scale that rates the extent and destructiveness of combat. By 2000, in spite of war in the Balkans and genocide in Rwanda, the number had fallen to 97; by 2002 to 81; and, at the end of 2004, it stood at 65. This suggests the extent and intensity of global combat is now less than half what it was 15 years ago.
How can war be in such decline when evening newscasts are filled with images of carnage? One reason fighting seems to be everywhere is that, with the ubiquity of 24-hour cable news and the Internet, we see many more images of conflict than before. A mere decade ago, the rebellion in Eritrea occurred with almost no world notice; the tirelessly globe-trotting Robert Kaplan wrote of meeting with Eritrean rebels who told him they hoped that at least spy satellites were trained on their region so that someone, somewhere, would know of their struggle. Today, fighting in Iraq, Sudan, and other places is elaborately reported on, with a wealth of visual details supplied by minicams and even camera-enabled cell phones. News organizations must prominently report fighting, of course. But the fact that we now see so many visuals of combat and conflict creates the impression that these problems are increasing: Actually, it is the reporting of the problems that is increasing, while the problems themselves are in decline. Television, especially, likes to emphasize war because pictures of fighting, soldiers, and military hardware are inherently more compelling to viewers than images of, say, water-purification projects. Reports of violence and destruction are rarely balanced with reports about the overwhelming majority of the Earth's population not being harmed.
Mueller calculates that about 200 million people were killed in the twentieth century by warfare, other violent conflicts, and government actions associated with war, such as the Holocaust. About twelve billion people lived during that century, meaning that a person of the twentieth century had a 1 to 2 percent chance of dying as the result of international war, ethnic fighting, or government-run genocide. A 1 to 2 percent chance, Mueller notes, is also an American's lifetime chance of dying in an automobile accident. The risk varies depending on where you live and who you are, of course; Mueller notes that, during the twentieth century, Armenians, Cambodians, Jews, kulaks, and some others had a far higher chance of death by war or government persecution than the global average. Yet, with war now in decline, for the moment men and women worldwide stand in more danger from cars and highways than from war and combat. World Health Organization statistics back this: In 2000, for example, 300,000 people died in combat or for war-related reasons (such as disease or malnutrition caused by war), while 1.2 million worldwide died in traffic accidents. That 300,000 people perished because of war in 2000 is a terrible toll, but it represents just.005 percent of those alive in that year.
This low global risk of death from war probably differs greatly from most of the world's past. In prehistory, tribal and small-group violence may have been endemic. Steven LeBlanc, a Harvard University archeologist, asserts in his 2003 book about the human past, Constant Battles, that warfare was a steady feature of primordial society. LeBlanc notes that, when the aboriginal societies of New Guinea were first observed by Europeans in the 1930s, one male in four died by violence; traditional New Guinean society was organized around endless tribal combat. Unremitting warfare characterized much of the history of Europe, the Middle East, and other regions; perhaps one-fifth of the German population died during the Thirty Years War, for instance. Now the world is in a period in which less than one ten-thousandth of its population dies from fighting in a year. The sheer number of people who are not being harmed by warfare is without precedent.

ext consider a wonderful fact: Global military spending is also in decline. Stated in current dollars, annual global military spending peaked in 1985, at $1.3 trillion, and has been falling since, to slightly over $1 trillion in 2004, according to the Center for Defense Information, a nonpartisan Washington research organization. Since the global population has risen by one-fifth during this period, military spending might have been expected to rise. Instead, relative to population growth, military spending has declined by a full third. In current dollars, the world spent $260 per capita on arms in 1985 and $167 in 2004.
The striking decline in global military spending has also received no attention from the press, which continues to promote the notion of a world staggering under the weight of instruments of destruction. Only a few nations, most prominently the United States, have increased their defense spending in the last decade. Today, the United States accounts for 44 percent of world military spending; if current trends continue, with many nations reducing defense spending while the United States continues to increase such spending as its military is restructured for new global anti-terrorism and peacekeeping roles, it is not out of the question that, in the future, the United States will spend more on arms and soldiers than the rest of the world combined.
Declining global military spending is exactly what one would expect to find if war itself were in decline. The peak year in global military spending came only shortly before the peak year for wars, 1991. There's an obvious chicken-or-egg question, whether military spending has fallen because wars are rarer or whether wars are rarer because military spending has fallen. Either way, both trend lines point in the right direction. This is an extremely favorable development, particularly for the world's poor--the less developing nations squander on arms, the more they can invest in improving daily lives of their citizens.

hat is causing war to decline? The most powerful factor must be the end of the cold war, which has both lowered international tensions and withdrawn U.S. and Soviet support from proxy armies in the developing world. Fighting in poor nations is sustained by outside supplies of arms. To be sure, there remain significant stocks of small arms in the developing world--particularly millions of assault rifles. But, with international arms shipments waning and heavy weapons, such as artillery, becoming harder to obtain in many developing nations, factions in developing-world conflicts are more likely to sue for peace. For example, the long, violent conflict in Angola was sustained by a weird mix of Soviet, American, Cuban, and South African arms shipments to a potpourri of factions. When all these nations stopped supplying arms to the Angolan combatants, the leaders of the factions grudgingly came to the conference table.
During the cold war, Marshall notes, it was common for Westerners to say there was peace because no fighting affected the West. Actually, global conflict rose steadily during the cold war, but could be observed only in the developing world. After the cold war ended, many in the West wrung their hands about a supposed outbreak of "disorder" and ethnic hostilities. Actually, both problems went into decline following the cold war, but only then began to be noticed in the West, with confrontation with the Soviet empire no longer an issue.
Another reason for less war is the rise of peacekeeping. The world spends more every year on peacekeeping, and peacekeeping is turning out to be an excellent investment. Many thousands of U.N., nato, American, and other soldiers and peacekeeping units now walk the streets in troubled parts of the world, at a cost of at least $3 billion annually. Peacekeeping has not been without its problems; peacekeepers have been accused of paying very young girls for sex in Bosnia and Africa, and nato bears collective shame for refusing support to the Dutch peacekeeping unit that might have prevented the Srebrenica massacre of 1995. But, overall, peacekeeping is working. Dollar for dollar, it is far more effective at preventing fighting than purchasing complex weapons systems. A recent study from the notoriously gloomy rand Corporation found that most U.N. peacekeeping efforts have been successful.
Peacekeeping is just one way in which the United Nations has made a significant contribution to the decline of war. American commentators love to disparage the organization in that big cereal-box building on the East River, and, of course, the United Nations has manifold faults. Yet we should not lose track of the fact that the global security system envisioned by the U.N. charter appears to be taking effect. Great-power military tensions are at the lowest level in centuries; wealthy nations are increasingly pressured by international diplomacy not to encourage war by client states; and much of the world respects U.N. guidance. Related to this, the rise in "international engagement," or the involvement of the world community in local disputes, increasingly mitigates against war.
The spread of democracy has made another significant contribution to the decline of war. In 1975, only one-third of the world's nations held true multiparty elections; today two-thirds do, and the proportion continues to rise. In the last two decades, some 80 countries have joined the democratic column, while hardly any moved in the opposite direction. Increasingly, developing-world leaders observe the simple fact that the free nations are the strongest and richest ones, and this creates a powerful argument for the expansion of freedom. Theorists at least as far back as Immanuel Kant have posited that democratic societies would be much less likely to make war than other kinds of states. So far, this has proved true: Democracy-against-democracy fighting has been extremely rare. Prosperity and democracy tend to be mutually reinforcing. Now prosperity is rising in most of the world, amplifying the trend toward freedom. As ever-more nations become democracies, ever-less war can be expected, which is exactly what is being observed.

or the great-power nations, the arrival of nuclear deterrence is an obvious factor in the decline of war. The atomic bomb debuted in 1945, and the last great-power fighting, between the United States and China, concluded not long after, in 1953. From 1871 to 1914, Europe enjoyed nearly half a century without war; the current 52-year great-power peace is the longest period without great-power war since the modern state system emerged. Of course, it is possible that nuclear deterrence will backfire and lead to a conflagration beyond imagination in its horrors. But, even at the height of the cold war, the United States and the Soviet Union never seriously contemplated a nuclear exchange. If it didn't happen then, it seems unlikely for the future.
In turn, lack of war among great nations sets an example for the developing world. When the leading nations routinely attacked neighbors or rivals, governments of emerging states dreamed of the day when they, too, could issue orders to armies of conquest. Now that the leading nations rarely use military force--and instead emphasize economic competition--developing countries imitate that model. This makes the global economy more turbulent, but reduces war.
In The Remnants of War, Mueller argues that most fighting in the world today happens because many developing nations lack "capable government" that can contain ethnic conflict or prevent terrorist groups, militias, and criminal gangs from operating. Through around 1500, he reminds us, Europe, too, lacked capable government: Criminal gangs and private armies roamed the countryside. As European governments became competent, and as police and courts grew more respected, legitimate government gradually vanquished thug elements from most of European life. Mueller thinks this same progression of events is beginning in much of the developing world. Government and civil institutions in India, for example, are becoming more professional and less corrupt--one reason why that highly populous nation is not falling apart, as so many predicted it would. Interstate war is in substantial decline; if civil wars, ethnic strife, and private army fighting also go into decline, war may be ungrafted from the human experience.

s it possible to believe that war is declining, owing to the spread of enlightenment? This seems the riskiest claim. Human nature has let us down many times before. Some have argued that militarism as a philosophy was destroyed in World War II, when the states that were utterly dedicated to martial organization and violent conquest were not only beaten but reduced to rubble by free nations that initially wanted no part of the fight. World War II did represent the triumph of freedom over militarism. But memories are short: It is unrealistic to suppose that no nation will ever be seduced by militarism again.
Yet the last half-century has seen an increase in great nations acting in an enlightened manner toward one another. Prior to this period, the losing sides in wars were usually punished; consider the Versailles Treaty, whose punitive terms helped set in motion the Nazi takeover of Germany. After World War II, the victors did not punish Germany and Japan, which made reasonably smooth returns to prosperity and acceptance by the family of nations. Following the end of the cold war, the losers--the former Soviet Union and China--have seen their national conditions improve, if fitfully; their reentry into the family of nations has gone reasonably well and has been encouraged, if not actively aided, by their former adversaries. Not punishing the vanquished should diminish the odds of future war, since there are no generations who suffer from the victor's terms, become bitter, and want vengeance.
Antiwar sentiment is only about a century old in Western culture, and Mueller thinks its rise has not been given sufficient due. As recently as the Civil War in the United States and World War I in Europe, it was common to view war as inevitable and to be fatalistic about the power of government to order men to march to their deaths. A spooky number of thinkers even adulated war as a desirable condition. Kant, who loved democracy, nevertheless wrote that war is "sublime" and that "prolonged peace favors the predominance of a mere commercial spirit, and with it a debasing self-interest, cowardice and effeminacy." Alexis De Tocqueville said that war "enlarges the mind of a people." Igor Stravinsky called war "necessary for human progress." In 1895, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. told the graduating class of Harvard that one of the highest expressions of honor was "the faith... which leads a soldier to throw away his life in obedience to a blindly accepted duty."
Around the turn of the twentieth century, a counter-view arose--that war is usually absurd. One of the bestselling books of late-nineteenth-century Europe, Lay Down Your Arms!, was an antiwar novel. Organized draft resistance in the United Kingdom during World War I was a new force in European politics. England slept during the '30s in part because public antiwar sentiment was intense. By the time the U.S. government abolished the draft at the end of the Vietnam War, there was strong feeling in the United States that families would no longer tolerate being compelled to give up their children for war. Today, that feeling has spread even to Russia, such a short time ago a totalitarian, militaristic state. As average family size has decreased across the Western world, families have invested more in each child; this should discourage militarism. Family size has started to decrease in the developing world, too, so the same dynamic may take effect in poor nations.
There is even a chance that the ascent of economics to its pinnacle position in modern life reduces war. Nations interconnected by trade may be less willing to fight each other: If China and the United States ever fought, both nations might see their economies collapse. It is true that, in the decades leading up to World War I, some thought rising trade would prevent war. But today's circumstances are very different from those of the fin de siècle. Before World War I, great powers still maintained the grand illusion that there could be war without general devastation; World Wars I and II were started by governments that thought they could come out ahead by fighting. Today, no major government appears to believe that war is the best path to nationalistic or monetary profit; trade seems much more promising.
The late economist Julian Simon proposed that, in a knowledge-based economy, people and their brainpower are more important than physical resources, and thus the lives of a country's citizens are worth more than any object that might be seized in war. Simon's was a highly optimistic view--he assumed governments are grounded in reason--and yet there is a chance this vision will be realized. Already, most Western nations have achieved a condition in which citizens' lives possess greater economic value than any place or thing an army might gain by combat. As knowledge-based economics spreads throughout the world, physical resources may mean steadily less, while life means steadily more. That's, well, enlightenment.
In his 1993 book, A History of Warfare, the military historian John Keegan recognized the early signs that combat and armed conflict had entered a cycle of decline. War "may well be ceasing to commend itself to human beings as a desirable or productive, let alone rational, means of reconciling their discontents," Keegan wrote. Now there are 15 years of positive developments supporting the idea. Fifteen years is not all that long. Many things could still go badly wrong; there could be ghastly surprises in store. But, for the moment, the trends have never been more auspicious: Swords really are being beaten into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks. The world ought to take notice.

History tends to support that statement. Things tend to happen in cycles, right now things are pretty stable (relatively speaking) and will probably remain so for at least another 20-30 years. A large portion of the worlds power rests in the hands of a small number of nations and none of them are particularly interested in starting a major war anytime soon.

The issue will arise when power becomes more equalized between alot of countries. Competition to be top dog will take over then, particularly if those countries are driven by religion or forcing other countries to adopt their style of government.

So for now your fine.
 
 
Yay! I'm so relieved.  
 
 
Aha. I was trying to figure out why this thread kept coming up without any new posts. Then I remembered that it's a poll. So, interesting results so far, at least to me. I hadn't expected there to be so many optimists out there, knew there were a few, but there seems to be about twice as many as there are of the "we're getting richer, but corrupt" crowd. Kinda the reverse of what I expected. On the other hand, it's definitely possible that the optimists just want to get the word out, and the pessimists just take it for granted that the world is deteriorating. Lots of world sucks votes since last time I looked, but no comments blaming it on Bush/capitalism. Interesting.
 
 
Let's see how popular the whine "moral decline" is.

Wow!
 
 
We are somewhere between
"End of the world as we know it" (and I feel fine)

and

"The futures so bright I gotta wear shades".

I bet one of those songs sticks in someones head  
 
 
I think the world is going over the deep end. Technology is advancing at the cost of the enviroment. United States is trying to assert its hegemony. China is trying to gain hegemony. The rise of extremism in Islam is making for an unsafe world. Africa has gone to ****. Basically, things are in a bad way. (not to mention things like the tsunamis or hurricaines ruining everything)

Solution?

I think there could be a solution to the worlds problem. But you won't like what I think, nor most likely enjoy it.

There is absolutely nothing in the above that could not be said about any time in recorded history.
What could not be said in any point in recorded history until now however is that global life expectancy is about 67 years.
So certainly materially (and I would argue that therefore morally as the world is a holistic place) things are getting better and better.
 http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/0448.shtml 
 
 
Look at the world of the 1800s and early 1900s. You had colonial empires dominating 90% of the world's nations, slavery/extreme racial discrimination, women had few rights, most men didn't have much in the way of rights either, constant wars between major world powers, extremely unsafe working conditions, little sanitation, environmental conditions poorer than today, etc. Today, everywhere is better off except possibly Africa. Hell, the world as a whole is even moving closer to free market capitalism. The pre-WWI era was also relatively free market (in some ways more so than now), but that era of classical liberalism had to compete with too many negative influences to be able to last. The current era of relatively free markets is more expansive and stable.

Only if you accept arbitrary religious morals (some religious morals happen to be rational morals as well, but not even close to all of them) is it even possible to argue that we are morally worse off. Unless you don't think ending/minimizing discrimination, promoting rule of law and democracy, and reducing crime and poverty are moral aims as well as material aims, we are definitly better off morally.
 
 
Cuban Missile Crisis. The Berlin Wall Crisis. How many times did we actually cocked the nuclear trigger - ON PURPOSE! The world is alot better.
 
 
You can't judge the world to be better or worse on what COULD have happened. Okay, thats not quite fair, since nuclear weapons are real and so have to be considered. But I'd still say MAD has been better than WWI and WWII. And there is no reason why we wouldn't have had more wars like those if there were no nukes.

Also, how would you categorize the Berlin Wall crisis or the Cuban Missile Crisis as making the world materially or morally worse? It could be that the shadow of nuclear war (not the war itself) makes the world worse (I don't agree, but its arguable), but does it make us materially worse off? And is a nation fighting a war with more powerful weapons more immoral than a nation fighting with less powerful weapons? I wouldn't say so, but I guess if you argue that some weapons are immoral, then the user of that weapon would also be immoral. So while you make a good case for the world not being perfect, I don't think it demonstrates the world being worse than 150 years ago.
 
 
Anytime you step back from mass suicide is a good thing.
 
 
Oh, I thought you were being sarcastic about the world being better  
 
 
I really think that nuclear weapons may have saved the world from extreme misery. Without nukes, I would not be surprised if we had had another world war (dang that grammar grates) if MAD had not come into existence. And if you look at the phenomenal advancement of technology during WWII, it's not hard to see that we would quickly learn to kill people even more effectively in a hypothetical WWIII. If you look at pictures of Tokyo after the fire bombing, it's pretty much indistinguishable from Hiroshima. Vast expanses of nothing but ash. I think WWII cost Russia alone something like 20 million dead. And that's without massive strategic airstrikes on their cities. In fact, I wonder if the world could have taken third world war within a 60 year timespan. Not that we would go back to the Dark Ages, but we may have been set back considerably. Heck, I may have just persuaded myself that nukes were the savior of humanity. How's that for messed up.

And 100, 200 or 500 years ago, this was not true?
 
 
It's always been true. If you read old books such as the Bible, you can see that human nature has not changed one iota. However, I think the scale of the problem has gone to a whole new level.
 
 
Things are getting better, people are generally getting richer to some degree, people are generally getting better educated to some degree, nations are generally getting either more democratic or more liberalised to some degree. Things are going peachy enough considering we live in the real world, and just about everything is better than it was in the old days.
 
 
The world overall has progressed in material wealth, - but not necessarily paralleled by happiness. (Unhappiness exists amongst the deprived of course, but also increasingly amongst the wealthier).

The moral standing of the world is in my view diminishing. Since WWII there was an ascent of morals with the pursuit of peace, the recognition of universal human rights with a reach for basic absolute moral standards, through the UN. Although the UN is a flawed, political body in the way it conducts business, it is its recognition of absolute morals that has been a great achievement.

The drive behind the imposition of these values has come from Western culture. Other cultures have lagged or stayed behind, some by a long way.

The ascent towards reaching absolute moral standard peaked (still well short) around the millennium and has fallen since. There are two reasons for this.

1. Muslim Fundamentalism. Whilst the muslim world in general may have been beginning to converge with western morals, the fundamentalists have sought to prevent this; Sharia doctrine does not recognise the priority of individual human rights. However, it is the radical movement that have precipitated a divergence. Amongst the radicals it is particularly the emergence of the toxic doctrine of Al Zawahiri, who wanted to eradicate Western values by any means both inside and outside the muslim world, adopted by OBL in the mid 90s, that is now leading to a viscious downward cycle: Unfortunately, his doctrine is becoming increasingly adopted amongst muslim all over the world, as a predicted consequence of the military action by the West in the past few years. Human rights and indiscriminate compassion mean nothing to adherents of Al Zawahiris doctrine.

2. Neocon foreign policy. It is recognised of course that self-defence, i.e. the targeting of a direct and imminent threat, is either included in, or ring-fenced from an absolute moral code. Neocon foreign policy, as written up in The Defence of America, adopted by the Bush administration in 2000 (unmandated), implements pre-eminent assault on other nations, not just as part of national security, but as strategy to further Americas global hedgemony and economic security. The plan explicitly required a new Pearl Harbour type event to enable it to be implemented, which was provided by 9/11. Implicit in this doctrine is a conflict with universal human right to life. Clearly the subsequent military action in Iraq and Lebanon has not changed the aims of Al Zawahiri, -how could it, this was already maxed out. But it has lead to the popularisation of the doctrine, most chillingly amongst 2nd generation immigrants. My perception is that it in turn has lead to an ascendance of dehumanistic views amongst westerners.

-certainly if these boards are anything to go by, as illustrated by these unopposed comments:

 
There are definitely things one could grab by the throat to quell Al Qaeda. About a billion of them in fact.
.ALL i can see is a military solution.
 

And these wellwishes for holding a view:

 
Eventually the Islamists will take care of the leftists for us....one way or another.(and you can bet your sweet assses on that prediction).
Either way, the left will get what it's got coming...

They adopted a policy, and sat back and hoped for 9/11. I suppose they orchestrated the whole thing too.  
 
 
No I'm not proposing the administration had anything to do with that. But it did provide the neocons with the opportunity to sell a long proposed invasion of Iraq.

Did you ever read the PNAC's "The Defence of America"?
 
 
 
No I'm not proposing the administration had anything to do with that.

 

Then you're saying they adoped a policy, that didn't change anything in reality.

 
But it did provide the neocons with the opportunity to sell a long proposed invasion of Iraq.

 

Thank God for that... But the reality there is that the US government was already sold on that, and simply waiting for an excuse. If that excuse had come durring Clinton we would have finished the Baath rule of Iraq then.

Really? Sure the Pentagon had a plan ready, ordered by Clinton in the wake of Desert Fox, who thought Saddam might try again. But I don't think the Clinton administration was ever contemplating a pre-emptive invasion.

The PNAC report didn't come out until the 2000 election campaign. (And, sorry, it was called "Rebuilding America's Defences", not what I said -it's been a while-, I just checked).
 
 
 
I don't think the Clinton administration was ever contemplating a pre-emptive invasion.

 

And before the excuse, neither was the Bush administration.   Is it still pre-emptive if you're holding a broken cease-fire?

Allow me to qualify that: There are many worlds. The good armchair general, as is his right, chose that of human endeavor. One can hold that nothing has changed qualitatively or quantitatively in that world. So, had he wanted to accommodate all possible viewpoints, he would have included "no change".

I can't speak for the world. But the UK is 100% deteriorating in many ways. It's almost as if every kid is a chav (hoodlum, whatever it's called in your part of the world) with no sense of respect for anything, and seriously under-educated.

Then there's the growing problem of extremists, Alot of them from Pakistan. Lets hope that when they see their government against said extremists. They will follow suit and not go the other way, they need to reclaim their religion back.
 
 
Gentlemen,

How was the youth in your day? My fellow youngsters only have one motto: "I don't care".

Well, sometimes they wake up from their apathy (I am not talking about healty Machiavellian apathy here!) and read on a pamphlet that there actually are animals, and that they are being tortured. Suddently the entire world becomes revolved about animal welfare, earth warming, poverty,...
They know too little to see the big picture, that a stable economy is what solves poverty, and not civil unrest.

Knowledge is evil. You Shall Now Know Too Much. The war in Iraq is evil. They should pull out. No, it would not cause a humanitarian crisis, they should pull out. (that if they actually know that there is a war)
Oh yes, and I don't want to do anything. I don't want to study, there is welfare, I will get a job that could be done by well-trained monkeys and earn some money so that I can smoke pot and watch video games all the time.

This is the youth of my generation. Of course, not all of them. But I see dangerously many clever minds deteriorating, becoming lowly proles just because of lack of motivation and unhealthy apathy. Too many for my liking.

How was it in your days?
 
 
I'm 18 myself. So I've seen alot of people in "my generation" really fall down. Sometimes it's like "look at yourself man, you're pathetic"

Alot of people take the rap/rebel culture too seriously. Whilst i also listen to hip hop and rap over other genres, i don't take it literally. It's just a form of entertainment. That's the main problem with kids these days, they take what they see on TV or in Games literally.

Alot of people I know also have parents who couldn't care less about them, sometimes it's both ways, the kid doesn't care what his/her parents think of them. They just don't care about anything.

I mean, i've met some real slutty girls my age, and I just sometimes feel sorry for their parents, then realise it was, for the most part, their fault in the first place.

It's not about religion and all that either, it just seems people are losing common sense these days too. Not even "street smart" as some people would call themselves.

Not trying to sound all high and mighty, but that's how I think it is for alot of people around my age and especially younger. Not all, there's alot of decent people too.
 
 
Glad that you understand me. It's sad, really sad for the people who fought or worked for the freedom of their children to be free to think, dress, love, do whatever they like. The children now don't care.
Freedom and good life is not a thing granted!

Is this the face of humanity we see as it is if it's not molded into shape, of has it always been like this?
If the first is true, then our nice little Western civilization will succumb in a few generations. Who will run it and fight for it if no one cares?

I would like to hear the comments of people of Glyn-like age about the youth in their days. It would really be interesting.
 
 
I was born at the beginning of WW2 and grew up during the 1940s. Things were always in short supply, rationing continued into the 1950s. Shop-bought toys were almost unknown. There were plenty of bombed buildings to explore. I didn't see a television (in 405 line black and white on a 12" screen!) until I was in my teens. Children had to be well behaved or they were disciplined. At school caning was common. Most people were poor (in financial terms) but boys tried to look smart and girls tried to look pretty. The cubs and scouts were popular as they had camps to attend in summer. Every scout had a fearsome looking sheath knife, but I don't recall any ever being used as a weapon. The church was still important, and we all made the most of our lives. We knew education offered rewards in the future. We were still a homogenous people as immigration hadn't started. Few people had cars and the vast majority used public transport. Looking back on it, they were good times. Crime was virtually unknown. Nobody had heard of pornography or 'recreational' drugs. Mobile phones, personal computers and the like were all in the future. Everyone was slim. Dear departed days.
I still tend to 'make do and mend', and abhor waste.
 
 
Glyn.

I was struck by the similarities of your childhood to mine, expect mine were those that were almost, such as exploring bombed out buildings, for I was fortunate enough to "escape" from France via Portugal in 1941 at age 2 with my mother and father, a French air force officer intent on getting back into the war by any means. By 1943, my family had taken up residence just outside Washington, D.C. and my father placed in command of a facility in Oklahoma for French air cadets being trained to take part in the liberation of France. I remember little of this, thought I recall vividly the wailing of firehouse sirens on VE day and people pouring into the streets. From that day on I don't recall by what series of events we ended up as permanent residents of Washington nor why my mother and her 3 children, me included, became citizens of the US. I do remember well growing up in Washingon and every summer being shipped off to the country to entertain myself as best I could in the woods and fields with semi-illiterate country-raised kids, who showed me a thing or two about common sense and making slingshots.
In any case, my childhood was similar to yours. No TV, a sharp rap on the knuckles with a ruler from the good sisters when I misbehaved in school, Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, respect for elders and awe of the policemen who walked (yes, walked) their beats in our peaceful neighborhood, few cars and plenty of parking:   And no drugs. Neighborhood kids even told the policeman on the beat about a downtown boy who was trying to sell stuff to them. He was arrested forthwith and no more was heard about drugs in general use until the 1960s brought us the love generation, Haight-Asbury, the cool aid acid test, and Timothy Leary, the phyciatrist, Harvard prof, and West Point drop-out gone loony. The 1950s were the grand post-war years despite the Korean War and the school drills in case of nulear attack from the USSR. Cars found a new style, the 1955 Chevy with the wraparound windshield, overhead camshaft V8, which is still a screamer, the Corvette, and the Thunderbird; and at about the same time came rock n'roll, with parents shuddering at its imlications for the morals of us teenagers. Elvis the Pelvis shown from waist up only on the Ed Sullivan show. There I think, began the informal split between parents and children that has lasted until now. What, afterall, was wrong with rock n'roll? I'll skip the rest and only add that distance in time from great wars diminishes the gratitude of those born to those who remember, but I don't find that to be so lamentable or a sign of weakness. I have an 18 year old son (late remarriage) and I see him and his friends preoccupied with cars, girls, beer, and rap, and having little inclination to join the military or to be part of our stuggles in Iraq and Afganistan. But I note their loyalty to each other, their code of honor, their can-do spirit in things small, and I see good raw material should we be attacked in earnest and thrown into a real war of survival. I think it is this way always in history with our young. If the cause is just and the need is great, they will fight, and fight well. I am sure it is the same in the "mother" country. Cheers, Jad
 
 
Wow JAD, I didn't know you came from France. I'll try to limit my French jokes. But no guarantees though. I'll still post one if a good one comes along.  

I often tell people that we have too much in this society. People, especially in the US these days, don't know this is not normal. Never in the history of mankind has any group of people have access to so much material with so little effort. It's not shocking that the Hollywood elite who travel abroad are stunned by the lack of material wealth in other parts of the world.

The cyclic law of civilisations is kicking in. Rich people think they need not fight for their freedom or wealth. In the end they cannot fight. So the poor man who has lived a hard time takes over, because he knows how to fight.

Lol...no problem with the French jokes. I've been here so long that I can't remember not being an American; and I am so saturated with American history that I have more affinity with the English than the French. Besides my mom is Austrian and as you no doubt know, an Austrian has a strong hold on California.

True, but America has this great talent - you manage to make people who might come from different cultures, religions (though you've grown dissapointingly bigoted there) and race come together as one and feel a sense of belonging.
Sure you have the nutjobs who claim that you have to be white, Protestant, and descended from England or Scotland to be considered "American", but it's been a long time since anyone from a group like this held major power or was listened to for anything more than a good laugh at they're expence when they've finished.

Europe is almost completely different.
I was surprised when in America that when you talk to a black or Asian person, they ALWAYS describe themselves as "Americans" and it never seemed odd to them.
It wasn't till I came home that I realised why I was suprised - Ireland is homogenous, generally, and in the rare instance that you meet a black or asian person they never describe themselves as "Irish".
"Nigerian" yes, "Korean", yes and "Brazilian", yes, but never do they answer to the place they live.
We're not good at creating integration.
It seems we build barriers, make them feel that you need Celtic blood and links, Gaeilge, a certain "Irish" look and mannerism and of course, you have to be "white" with a thousand traceable years of family heritage.

And we're the "tolerant" Europeans, on the continent, they LOVE the Irish, because we're defineable, and they like that.
It sickens me to no end, we have a lot to learn.

I consider myself pro-US, I favour trans-atlanticism and think that you should be hugely proud of what you've achieved.

You may be right. We'll see. Chinese have always been that way here. The Irish, Germans and Poles started out that way and slowly integrated. The Italians still have their little Italies.

A quick anecdote: I worked last fall with a 1st generation Mexican immigrant who had the opportunity to travel in Europe recently. Naturally, he expected to get along best in Spain, if only because of the common language, but to his pleasant surprise he found the Irish to be much more warm and receptive. Oh how he lauded Ireland.

As for this threat posed by multiculturalism, I seriously question it. Another anecdote: My Catholic grade school student body is composed of roughly 20% 1st-generation immigrants (Yes, I graduated long ago, my brother attends currently), mostly from West Africa and Laos. I repeat, this is a private, Catholic, suburban school. Their all kids. Culture doesn't stop them from drawing naughty pictures in the bathroom and getting acne.
 
 
I don't think humans have change since Genesis, brother will get jealous and kill brother. Children take in prejudice and the other attitudes, like tolerance, with their mother's milk. Those that follow us will make the world according to what we teach them.

I guess I agree with you to a point.

Let's just say Europe is driving off that cliff at 60 mph while the US doing it at 40 mph.  

The thing is, America IS changing alot these days.
Not like when I got here where my parents (and their children) would think of ourselves as americans first and tried very hard to adopt to their ways.

These days, it seem like the whole world is trying to get in to the US purely for economic reasons as opposed to idealistic reasons....

Explain, please  

 

It appears that others have given an answer before I arrived.
What I meant is exactly like, for example Crooks said. In Europe, the politicians are boosting active multiculturalism, in which they think that different cultures can coexist and love each other.
What happens is: the native population has to be tolerant of other cultures, because you're an evil nazi if you don't. The immigrants don't have to do anything, they can hate you and your "whore people", it is allowed for them because it's their culture and we have to be sensible.

The degree in which the above happens, at least in the Benelux and France, is not to be underestimated. I can give several examples. The French banlieu riots, when immigrant youth threw molotov cocktails at cars. In Russia, the US or Israel they would be machine gunned. Here they spoke about "misunderstood youth".
Theo van Gogh, killed in the Netherlands for a movie. No one said anything, even given the fact that the letter nailed with a knife to his back clearly said: "you shall burn, Babylon, you shall burn, Europe, you shall burn, infidel".
Not to mention the AEL under Abou JahJah. The CIA would have eliminated the man before he was born, here he was publicly speaking about that Belgians have to integrate themselves into Arab culture.
No reaction whatsoever, only from the hardcore right, who were treated as nazi.

That, and the fact that the immigrants get 7-8 kids. In 30 years it's possible that 1/3 of all Western Europe would be muslim.

yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look. Competition is in the cards for all of us. The question is in my mind; will it accelerate global well being for all or merely line the pockets of those who desire a gold-plated coffin. Getting back to the original thread, I believe that the attitude of the world has improved, morally towards the disadvantaged, and materially for many. After all, there was a 100-200 year time span posited.
 
 
You can look at it this way. Every huge social movement (American Revolution, Communism, etc. etc. etc.) intended for people to change for the better. Instead each time people ended up adapting the idea to their needs, rather then changing themselves for the better. Realistically this means that humans themselves have not become any better in the traditional sense of the word (i.e. kinder, more compassionate, more ethical).

The problem however is that there is no such thing as "better overall". When you ask has the world become better my reply would be "Better for whom?"

Sir, it is not entirely true.
Problems are relative. A man who has to fight for his survival will not care that much about an issue that a wealthy man will commit suicide about. Both are equally happy/unhappy, because the wealthy man is much more hit by a small problem.

In Russia and the USSR, living was hard enough for people not to notice small problems. Depression wasn't an issue at all. Sure, people were glad and sad but I only first saw depression when I came to the West.
Depression (of all kind) is an issue that often happens to wealthy people, often those whose parents can provide them with everything they need, or who got everything they need by themselves. Small, often social problems like the lack of good friends in an increasingly apathic society take their toll.
Just look at the suicide rates.

I am not saying that people should become poor and that material sufficience is a bad thing, only that it does by no means make people happier. They find their problems to worry about, no matter what.
 
 
 
You mean next Chinese will conquered the world(Billions of little educated poeple....)      

Edit: Grammar.

 

Possible.

On one hand I still remember being flabbergasted when a swedish girl complained about not being able to wash dishes, because it causes allergic reaction to her. Or a Utah girl crying about the lack of hot water.

On the other hand - depression - take a look at Europes suicide rates. And not now, but 15-20 years ago. AFAIK Hungary was absolute top, Estonians close second, then came first wealthy country (Finland ?).
(I could be wrong here little bit, I´m too tired to search for the correct data, but basic idea remains the same )
 
 
 
I've said it before and I'll say it again, there ain't no time in history that has so many happy feed housed long living positively pampered people as there are right now. How is that a bad thing?

 

If I edit this to

there ain't no time in history that has so many people as there are right now.

then I could agree with you. In fact there are more people alive right now than all the people who have dwelt on this planet throughout history (or at least this has been claimed).

I think that's a testament to how good the world is today. We have just as many miserable people who can think of nothing but survival. But now we have an entire group of people who have everything already and they are depressed about the little things.

That's progress.
 
 
 
 
We have to be very careful with our multiculturalism though. It's slowly becoming the European model where everyone stays in their own enclave and demand the natives to "respect" their culture.

 

You may be right. We'll see. Chinese have always been that way here. The Irish, Germans and Poles started out that way and slowly integrated. The Italians still have their little Italies.

 

Not sure what is wrong with respect each other. Not sure what special respect Chinese demanded in America.

If you do a little bit research on your countrys recent history, you will know that the China towns in US have their historical roots. They were built by the older Chinese immigrants. Until WWII, there were discrimination laws against Chinese people and it restricted Chinese people to live in certain areas. Buying a house outside China town was restricted by the laws for the average Chinese Americans. The law created those kinds of isolated environment for Chinese Americans.

The society also creates a barrier for the Asian people sometimes. A Chinese enlisted in USAF wrote about his experience. He always wears a USAF uniform. But he was still asked by many people whether he is a PLA official visiting US.

If you go to Chicago, you will find relatively concentrated communities of Chinese, Russian, Greek, Irish, Poles, Mexican, Africa American and so on. Similar people with similar economic status, culture background and life style live close to each other. They have special shops to sell products that only their people like to buy. As for the common culture of this country, if a person wants to live a better life, he will have to get familiar with it. Otherwise, it is him to suffer.

Very few new Chinese immigrants live in China town today. The largest crowds of new Chinese immigrants are engineers who work in all kind of companies. They mostly live in suburb resident areas. Most of them have higher education degrees and work hard to support their families. They may not like McDonald instead of loving Chinese food but they love this country and contribute to this country.

When I see people from different countries celebrate their traditional festivals and national days in America and by the July 4th, everyone celebrate Americas independent day. I really feel the greatness of America that can tolerate each other, respect each other and by the end of the day, live with each other peacefully to build this country. I admire that.

BTW, I am not an immigrant. I just have a visa to stay and visit America because of the nature of my job.

I don't mean multiculturalism is bad. I mean we should be very careful about how we implement multiculturalism.

It's good to have many different people bring their cultures to this wonderful land. But the new comers must also respect those who are already here.

All government documents and proceedings should be conducted in English only. All voting ballots should be printed in English only. Driving tests should be administered in English. All classes other than foreign language classes should be conducted in English in public schools.

As of right now, we have the so called bilingual education that educates immigrants, a vast majority of them Mexicans, in Spanish. This is done in our public schools. Our voting ballots are printed in other languages. All you have to do is ask and you can vote for government officials in the United States using Spanish/Vietnamese/Chinese or any number of popular languages. You can take our driver's test in a foreign language.

I don't mind immigrants celebrate their own culture on their own time. I have a problem with immigrants bringing their culture into the public using tax dollars.

Have you heard this new one? Some universities now have "footwash basin" for the muslim students. An elementary school in San Diego pauses class 15 min everyday so the muslim students can pray.

I have no problem with muslims in this country. I have a problem when they demand special treatment.

Correct, so far...

 
Until WWII, there were discrimination laws against Chinese people and it restricted Chinese people to live in certain areas. Buying a house outside China town was restricted by the laws for the average Chinese Americans. The law created those kinds of isolated environment for Chinese Americans.
 

This wasn't true nationwide.

As far as I know there have never been any Federal laws requiring Chinese Americans citizens to live in certain areas. There might have been some early territorial laws; perhaps in California. But generally, Chinese Americans could buy a house wherever they wanted to. Where discrimination existed it was subtle.

It was done by writing it into land deeds in the form of restrictive covenants. These covenants controlled what owners could do with their property, for example who they could sell it to. For example a covenant might say the owner could sell only to a Christian American caucasian. That eliminated hispanics, blacks, Jews, Chinese and Native americans, buddists, all immigrants, etc., etc. This kind of covenant was somewhat common in upscale neighborhoods.

My mother, now 97 and still giving me hell, was a real estate broker from the mid-1940s in Washington, DC., --and by the way, an immigrant to the US-- tried unsucessfully several times to get around restrictive covenants in the 1950s and finally succeeded in 1964 when the courts stopped honoring them.
 
 
 
Like Kosovo?

 

Heh...like everywhere in the world.
 
 
 
I don't mind immigrants celebrate their own culture on their own time. I have a problem with immigrants bringing their culture into the public using tax dollars.

 

The problem is this. As long as the immigrant is a legal immigrant, then as a citizen he shares the same rights and responsibilities as you. As such then what he/she is asking for, say ballot papers in Chinese, is not so much special privilege as equal access.

Edit: And I have as usual started side-tracking the main thread.

That is the argument for the Voting Rights Act.

However, to become a citizen of this nation, and every nation on this earth, I suspect, one has to be proficient in the main operation language of that nation.

I don't expect to become a French citizen while not being proficient in French, then demand to participate in local elections using my native tongue.

I know for a fact that one has to be proficient in Danish to become a citizen of Denmark. The Danes may go as far as demanding new immigrants be proficient in Danish even if they have no intention of becoming citizens.

Ah, but would this retired and humble spear-carrier have dared to correct the spelling or grammar of one of our glorious moderators?   Heavens forfend  
 
 
Makes sense that if they're going to live in the country they need to speak the language. I'd assume this is a basic safety precaution against cultural assimilation of the native population in waves of immigrants.
 
 
 
Heh...like everywhere in the world.

 

I did not demand Europeans to give me a special treatment - I saw how it is done here, and I did like them.
I would never ever ask for more Russians to be on TV, in commercial magazines (you know, the multicultural happy kids in IKEA magazines). I would even feel uncomfortable if it happened.
I analyzed Western values, and in fact I like them. I can understand that not everyone likes everything, but they can respect them at least.
I never ever thought about calling Western habits inferior, Western women whorish, and Westerners corrupt. If I would be Orthodox, I would quietly ask for a church.

There is a Russian saying: don't visit another house with your own samovar.

If I can do something, the others can do it too, Muslim or not.

The problem is you're confused between immigrant and citizen. Think "resident alien" and "citizen" instead. Immigrant is not a legal status because it may include both. I am a citizen and an immigrant. BTW, because of the latter I cannot become president of the US.   Nice to have an excuse.

I was actually talking about immigrant citizens like you. I was specifically thinking about the ballot papers when I was writing. It probably extends into education in Spanish (The children of even illegal immigrants, if born in the US, would be US citizens.)

The resident aliens would be in the green card program. (is that accurate?) I wasn't thinking of them as a category at all because I've always assumed there aren't very many of them.

You do have a point there. I suppose the real problem is with illegal immigrants becoming citizens. (Kids born in the US and such). I'm not sure but I think(I'm not certain) that for legal immigration you probably do need English proficiency and they are probably more driven individuals in any case so they are unlikely to be a SS burden.

Correct for permanent residents. I don't know how many green carders there are, but it's not uncommon.
 
 
 
What do you mean by ballot papers?

 

I meant the voting ballots with candidate name and such. I'm also given to understand that you voters get to vote on certain "propositions" directly as a means of bypassing a hostile legislature.

In any case I don't really have an answer. I was just laying out a possible argument for the availability of these services/rights(voting ballots, drivers test, education) in various languages.

Thanks for clarifying your opinion and I agree with most of them now.

The bilingual education or even signal minority language education (Chinese is just one language class) are provided in China today for most minority living areas. If China stops the practice, I am sure that US will accuse China for violating the human right of Chinese minorities.

I think that the ordinary new immigrants need to pass some English and America history/knowledge tests to become US permanent residents (Green Card) and citizen today, but not sure how difficult those tests are.

I checked the history of Chinese immigrant again and found that you are correct that there were not Federal laws restricting Chinese Americans buying house outside of Chinatown.

But there were Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and Immigration Act of 1924 discriminating against Chinese as well as other Asian immigrant groups. Those Acts created beyond subtle discrimination.

I cite a paragraph from the link below:

 The Chinese-American Experience: An Introduction 

Under the racist slogan, "Chinese must go!" an anti-Chinese movement emerged that worked assiduously to deprive the Chinese of a means of making a living in the general economy. The movements goal was to drive them out of the country. This hostility hindered efforts by the Chinese to become American. It forced them to flee to the Chinatowns on the coasts, where they found safety and support. In these ghettos, they managed to eke out a meager existence, but were isolated from the rest of the population, making it difficult if not impossible to assimilate into mainstream society. To add insult to injury, Chinese were criticized for their alleged unassimilability.

I would like to acknowledge the fact that subtle race discrimination may still exist today but I dont clearly feel it in my daily life and work place although I am a foreigner. My colleagues and neighbors are all very nice people.

There was some Chinaphobia, to coin a term, back then. A different mindset on account of racial fears no doubt. Not a shining example of our immigrant heritage.

The Chinatowns started well before the 1880s. As I heard it, Chinese were brought here originally by the railroads starting in the mid-1800s to work as laborers because the gold rush drained off American labor. The Chinese were told they could make a fortune here and many planned to come, earn a lot of money and then go back home and buy land. That's why they held on to their customs and language, and didn't try to assimilate. Chinatowns were the natural result.

welll no the world if anything is due for another world war which will happen i dont think in this generation but probaly the next 1 theres too much hostilties going around chinas growing and if people think the kwans are gonna be peaceful lol ur sadly wrong once america stops being number 1 the chinese will be able to throw their weight around the middle east is just a freaking hotbed ready to explode and irans supposed civil nuclear progam which we all know is really for weapons use will spark that war so my prediction

the usa engaed in the middle east with isareal against iran and about every other muslim there

china vs the eu over who gets to be top dawg

I for one don't believe there's enough resources in the world to go around for everybody to enjoy a Western standard of living. Population growth needs to be checked then reversed.

In the future I see any number of small wars arising as a result of conflict over land and resources in regions where conditions are marginal. A prime example would be Darfur, which is masqueraded as an Arab-Black or Muslim/non-Muslim conflict in the media, but is actually a conflict over land for farming and grazing, as are countless other conflicts in Africa, probably most.

I see a possibility of Balkanization in Indonesia, with East Timor, Aceh, and West Papua in mind.

we can feed the world right now with current production levels, 3 square meals a day. Give everyone access to clean water. It's not a population problem. Cut the population of the earth in half, and you'd still have the same stupid 'leaders' starving and driving out their people. The same famines, the same wars. It's about use and abuse of power, not numbers.

No doubt you are right when it comes to food and water, but when it comes to a car or two in every driveway, a full set of kitchen appliances, and the whole range of consumer products, what then?

You not only have to provide the natural resources for all these things, but the resources to build the factories and distribute the products. It adds up to an enormous amount of material and energy. How much I don't know.

When I was a kid no one had air conditioning; we sweltered thru the summer, but managed. Now nearly every home, office, car and store in the western world has it and the far east seems to be catching up. The energy to run the units adds up to the annual output of X power plants which impose on us the sight of more and more overhead power lines. Imagine the whole world demanding air conditioning. What will the cost be on the environment in terms of natural resources? Common sense tells us the drain on finite resources will be huge. And that's just one western luxury.
 
 
On the button. Energy resources are the greatest challenges facing us this century. We've been lazy over the last 500 years in developing where and how we generate and use power, using antiquated systems because it's been readily available at little immediate cost. Not least because of our reliance on oil and all the fighting that it has caused, we need to concentrate on other sources. The universe is jam packed with energy, in fact is nothing BUT energy, but the way we utilise it, what sources we use, and the waste we generate are all central issues.
As an example: or all the appliances in your house, how many have a transformer to reduce the level of power to a level those appliances actually use, and waste the rest in heat?
Why does every cell phone or computer have a different transformer and plug, so when you update your phone or laptop, you have to buy a new transformer as well?
We need to get a lot smarter in how we generate and how we use energy.

We can feed many more people than what we have now. We also have enough resources to provide everyone on this earth with decent living like clean water, adequate food, and keep infectious diseases in check.

The problem is with distribution of said resources.

Often wonder about that myself, expecially since I have a zillion of them languishing in a box in my garage. Lack of standardization or universality seems to be the problem. Do you notice how much heat they put out...waste, I suppose.

Marketing is a bedfellow of waste; one example; you can buy 6 and 8 foot kits for porch rails made of vinyl. If you only need 5 ft or 6 ft 2 ", the rest is waste, the top and bottom rail and all the unused ballesters-all scrap...it takes oil to make them! Why do they do it? Fits in box; truck loading is easier and no loose inventory and they sell more goods by selling waste.
There are hundreds of schemes like that in just my trade. You should see the wire wasted after an electrical rough in or the metal and ducting materials after an HVAC one, or have you already?

As Parihaka said, that's the big question. Almost always has been, at least since we graduated from wood and animals as our primary energy source. While we've managed to stay ahead of the game, assuming that that will always hold true may be foolish.

However, I would also ask you to imagine a whole world composed of people as productive and creative as Americans and Westerners in general. The power that human ingenuity has shown in the past is truly extraordinary. I believe that human resources will prove far more important than natural resources in the future, as it has been proven many times in the past.

As for energy, I find it hard to believe that the enormous untapped energy resources all around us will prove unusable in the future. Energy may become more costly in the future, but I expect that any shortfall will be temporary, unless bad economic policies (read: price controls, rationing) remove incentives to develop new energy sources and/or to develop energy efficiency.

I fully suibscribe to that view. There is energy all over the place albeit in forms we haven't yet tapped. But we will. Human resources, as you said. BTW, there's a company that is marketing hydrogen generators for homes based on cost effective method of extracting hydrogen from ammonia. Whether this one works efficiently or not, we're getting closer.
 
 
 
However, I would also ask you to imagine a whole world composed of people as productive and creative as Americans and Westerners in general. efficiency.

 

The whole world is composed of people like that, they just all happen to move to the U.S. as soon as they can.
 
 
I think it is better if we could use our renewable resources as source of power to augment the shortage..more friendly to the environment..

The world is getting better, though no one likes to hear it.

BY STEPHEN MOORE
Friday, October 5, 2007 12:01 a.m. EDT

I'm old enough to recall the days in the late 1960s when people wore those trendy buttons that read: "Stop the Planet I Want to Get Off." And I will never forget that era's "educational" films of what life would be like in the year 2000. Played on clanky 16-millimeter projectors, they showed images of people walking down the streets of Manhattan with masks on, so they could avoid breathing the poison gases our industrial society was spewing. Yeah baby, I remember those

The future seemed mighty bleak back then, and you merely had to open the newspapers for the latest story confirming how the human species was speeding down a congested highway to extinction. A group of scientists calling themselves the Club of Rome issued a report called "Limits to Growth." It explained that lifeboat Earth had become so weighed down with humans that we were running out of food, minerals, forests, water, energy and just about everything else that we need for survival. Paul Ehrlich's best-selling book "The Population Bomb" (1968) gave England a 50-50 chance of surviving into the 21st century. In 1980, Jimmy Carter released the "Global 2000 Report," which declared that life on Earth was getting worse in every measurable way.
Jimmy, yeah, I remember that report, kinda reminds me of a current American politician
So imagine how shocked I was to learn, officially, that we're not doomed after all. A new United Nations report called "State of the Future" concludes: " People around the world are becoming healthier, wealthier, better educated, more peaceful, more connected, and they are living longer."  

Yes, of course, there was the obligatory bad news: Global warming is said to be getting worse and income disparities are widening. But the joyous trends in health and wealth documented in the report indicate a gigantic leap forward for humanity. This is probably the first time you've heard any of this because--while the grim "Global 2000" and "Limits to Growth" reports were deemed worthy of headlines across the country--the media mostly ignored the good news and the upbeat predictions of "State of the Future."

But here they are: World-wide illiteracy rates have fallen by half since 1970 and now stand at an all-time low of 18%. More people live in free countries than ever before. The average human being today will live 50% longer in 2025 than one born in 1955.

To what do we owe this improvement? Capitalism, according to the U.N.   Free trade is rightly recognized as the engine of global prosperity in recent years.   In 1981, 40% of the world's population lived on less than $1 a day. Now that percentage is only 25%, adjusted for inflation. And at current rates of growth, "world poverty will be cut in half between 2000 and 2015"-   - which is arguably one of the greatest triumphs in human history. Trade and technology are closing the global "digital divide," and the report notes hopefully that soon laptop computers will cost $100 and almost every schoolchild will be a mouse click away from the Internet (and, regrettably, those interminable computer games).

It also turns out that the Malthusians (who worried that we would overpopulate the planet) got the story wrong. Human beings aren't reproducing like Norwegian field mice. Demographers now say that in the second half of this century, the human population will stabilize and then fall. If we use the same absurd extrapolation techniques demographers used in the 1970s, Japan, with its current low birth rate, will have only a few thousand citizens left in 300 years.

I take special pleasure in reciting all of this global betterment because my first professional job was working with the "doom-slaying" economist Julian Simon. Starting 30 years ago, Simon (who died in 1998) told anyone who would listen--which wasn't many people--that the faddish declinism of that era was bunk. He called the "Global 2000" report "globaloney." Armed with an arsenal of factual missiles, he showed that life on Earth was getting better, and that the combination of free markets and human ingenuity was the recipe for solving environmental and economic problems. Mr. Ehrlich, in response, said Simon proved that the one thing the world isn't running out of "is lunatics."

Mr. Ehrlich, whose every prediction turned out wrong, won a MacArthur Foundation "genius award"; Simon, who got the story right, never won so much as a McDonald's hamburger. But now who looks like the lunatic? This latest survey of the planet is certainly sweet vindication of Simon and others, like Herman Kahn, who in the 1970s dared challenge the "settled science." (Are you listening, global-warming alarmists?)

The media's collective yawn over "State of the Future" is typical of the reaction to just about any good news. When 2006 was declared the hottest year on record, there were thousands of news stories. But last month's revised data, indicating that 1934 was actually warmer, barely warranted a paragraph-long correction in most papers.

So I'm happy to report that the world's six billion people are living longer, healthier and more comfortably than ever before. If only it were easy to fit that on a button.

Good article Pari. However, it doesn't include anything about moral deterioration. Does that mean there is no deterioration of morals, or that there is no morals on Wall Street?  
 
 
Lies!!! All lies!!!

The world is coming to an end. Life back then was much better. The air was clean. The earth was cool. There were no diseases and everyone lived to be 100!

What do you mean by morals? Babies born to unwed parents? Homosexual marriage? Kids wearing pants below their buttocks? Pre-marital sex? Slip-and-fall lawyers suing anyone for anything?
 
 
Morally better, absolutely, although as Gunnut points out, morality is subjective.
But....

been a long time since we carpet bombed anyone....
been a long time since anyone (in the west anyway) owned a slave...
been over one hundred years since women in NZ got the vote (we were the first you know)
was just the other day when the excuse of reasonable force was removed from our statutes concerning hitting children...

Are we getting better morally? Absolutely.
 
 
If you say so, that's cool with me.  
 
 
 
was just the other day when the excuse of reasonable force was removed from our statutes concerning hitting children...

 

I hope that doesn't mean no spanking. Every kid needs a good whack once in while, IMHO.
 
 
Dang. I didn't expect this thread to still be active a year and a half after I started it. Cool.

And I'm still undecided on the question I posed. Oh well.

I agree. There has been an absolutely world-changing attitude shift, and, apart from the most benighted parts of the world, it has been very progressive. Certain inhumane acts and practices, even mores and customs, have been fundamentally altered, mostly for the good.

The vast majority of humanity is beginning to embrace the greatest, most revolutionary ideal that was brought forth from developing civilization: human beings have intrinsic worth; each individual life must be accorded respect. To those people with no sense of history, it must be explained that this is NOT the way it had always been (and, as I mentioned, in certain backward cultures, it still isn't).

But the world's eyes are being opened to a new way of seeing what it means to be human...and HUMANE.

With some notable and regrettable exceptions, we're getting better.

And that's the whole point of being here.

The last person to successfully use the excuse of reasonable force beat their child with a riding whip for ten minutes, and got off the assault charges 2 years ago.
By removing the reasonable force clause, it is up to the police and courts to decide what is and isn't reasonable, something they are in general quite good at doing.
Thus, since the change in law, probably 1 million children have had their bum smacked, and no parents have been either investigated or prosecuted. The very same parents of the riding whip incident however have been successfully prosecuted, this time for tying their child up with duct tape and kicking them repeatedly.

San Francisco just passed a law banning "spanking" children by the parents.
 
 
I guess I'll have to hire someone to do it now...

Cant vote, as my conviction isnt listed. Namely, that it is still getting worse, but that soon it will begin to get better. The Kali Yuga is nearly at an end.

EDIT: Actually, since you list the question as "in the long run" I choose Nothing changes. Every single thing in existence is cyclical.

EDIT2: Although, truely, there are no "things".  
 
 
What?

The Maya calender is near it's end as well. 2012 is the year, they say.

And yes, nothing changes. Things will always remain the same, until man evolves to Homo Superior.

The combination of superior understanding with animal instincts is destructive indeed, sir!
 
 
What a happy bunch you are

Yeah, on my birthday and my little sisters is September 11. Unlucky.

You know, it could be that they didn't bother to calculate too far ahead because it's labor intensive. They figure they can add on to the calender later. If they had ended their calculations a cycle earlier or a cycle later, we wouldn't have this problem.

No way. Mutants get into much more trouble than us. They all have special powers and want nothing less than to dominate over the other side.
 
 
It does seem like the world is getting better, for humans. But can it last? Rivers are polluted, the ocean is polluted, air is polluted, species are going extinct left and right because of habitat destruction. How much longer can the earth bear the strain?

Demographic predictions say the population will level off at 9 billion in 2050 and then begin to decline.
 
 
I'd say that on the whole the world was getting better in a lot of places and worse in some others, but on the whole it's getting better. What really highlights the worse bits is that we have unparalleled ability to examine the worst bits in the history of civilization. When we have the ability to find out as much bad stuff going on in the World as we have time to look, it paints a very bad picture.

The truth is that bad things have always gone on, it's just our awareness of them that's changed. On the other hand, I'm not down with the media worship of a-hole culture in pop culture that's taken over from anything remotely noble about humanity.
 
 
I will say it is getting better just because the world of Islam is no longer able to slaughter millions of people and enslave them now. They at least have to pretend to be "peaceful and tolerant" now even though they don't want you to seriously believe that.

I take it you come down on the side of the world doesn't change in general, only that conditions improve here and there and likewise worsen.

The original question is flawed. People have different ideas of what the "world" is. There is the world of science; the world of religion; the world of business; and so on. But most everyone who has pitched in to this thread seems to be taking the world as the world of human existence and all its facets. Thus people think the world is getting better, worse or is unchanging depending on conditions in which man lives today. But, they overlook the basic fact that man himself has not changed. He is capable of the same goodness and cruelty, the same billiance and stupidity; and the same generosity and selfishness today as he was at the beginning of history. And because the nature of man hasn't changed, the world hasn't changed. It still flows and ebbs as alway and no amount of religious influence or enlightened attitudes has or will make the world any different than it was at the time of the ancient Greeks or Egyptians. The only way the world will change is if people change, and while that isn't impossible, it is improbable. We can't do anything to change the world, but we can change ourselves. So it's time to decide: Miller Lite or Bud Lite.

And yet I'd argue that things have changed, simply because the ability to murder individuals or groups has been restricted in many parts of the world. That is a change in the nature of man.

I think it is good that you brought that up because it shows that man can create social structures that check man's base tendencies. But can you say that laws against murder, for example, actually change man's nature? Wouldn't you say they restrain his nature.

Shifting gears a bit and speaking of murder, one runs across descriptions of what life was like in places where murder was very rare even though governmnental authority was practically non-existent. There is a remote region of the US called Appalachia which stretches from western Maryland to South Carolina and Tennessee. It is a mountainous region which until well into the 20th Century was practically inaccessible. The population was mostly descended from Scottish immigrants who came to America before the Revolutionary War. They fought in the Revolutionary War to defend their freedom and again in the Civil War for the same reason. When Lincoln called for volunteers from Tennessee, they turned out en masse. Life in Appalachia was very hard and still is in places. Everything they needed they made themselves, even the booze made from corn we call shine. Contact with outsiders was rare. Law officers were even rarer. Yet, burglary and murder were practically non-existent. The reason had to do with the near absense of government presense. In lieu of government they had developed a practical code of behavior that everyone followed of their own accord out of pride. So, when it comes to murder, a case can be made that well enforced laws help keep it down, but at the same time, it may be that pervasive government regulation of all aspects of life leads to frustrations that ultimately explode in violence. None of which argues that man has changed one iota since the beginning of recorded time.

I disagree with this. I'd say man has changed. The brutalities of day to day life in even our recent past of a few hundred years ago tell me this. While we do still have a tendency to turn upon our neighbor in a violent manner for basically irrational motives, the tendency seems to be toward compassion and reason. The identity group of the average person also seems to be rapidly expanding, which I think is a major, if not THE major, contributor toward peaceful relations.

I would also go on to posit the idea that this is possible mainly due to expansion in vocabularies, but that's for some other thread, maybe. Basically, it is evolving cultural paradigms shaped by language that is the effectual process, whatever the actual causal entities may be.

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm saying that based on historical trends eventually the identity group will include all of us. From self, to clans, to tribalism, to city-states, to nations, to ideologies(?), to universalism.

The change you think you see in man is not change in the basic animal, but the result of influences on his basic nature. Let's imagine man as a large control board in a recording studio. All the slide controls sit there inert until someone moves them. When the engineer moves a slide, the sound changes. Would you say that the control board has changed its basic nature? No. It's built-in properties were manipulated from outside to produce a different result. That's the state of man today, yesterday and always. Fashions change, new innovations come about, enlightened reasonings are developed, and all that, but they are just influences. Man's response to them comes from his existing wiring.

And please don't try to argue that man can replace his old control board with a new one. Man may think he's the cat's ass, but look at him as he really is. For example, has he yet to bring peace to the world? No. Why not? He just ain't built to be peaceful all the time. His nature dictates that he be in conflict; he always feels a need to overcome some hurdle...some mysterious hurdle. You want to find answers, focus on that basic contradiction. And how about this question: Why does man fight for peace? Could it be that he is too stupid to realize that fighting is contrary to peace? Or is he fooled by leaders who say they want peace but in reality just want power. Peace is only possible if all people will it. But they won't, because nothing ever changes in that basic conflict within them. A man can change himself, but that is another subject.

Did you know the ice sheet on the SOUTH pole is getting thicker because it's colder there now?

I think the world is getting worse because the next ice age will hit soon. Everything above the temperate zone will be covered by vast glaciers and millions of people will be forced to most to the tropics.

Firstly, if one completely rejects darwinism and the theory of evolution, then no change can be admitted, and if one embraces the theory, then change must be admitted. I think that is evident and undeniable. It follows that if one favors the middle ground of these two stances then change is probable.

Regardless, I think looking at man and his "control board" of influences as separate entities is too narrow a paradigm. I reject it out of hand, actually   I think these things are wholly inter-connected. There is plenty of science operating on the fringes of main-stream thought that points to this e.g. in physics and biology.

EDIT: Well, I want to expand on my first paragraph there. Take the domestic dog as an example. I think it is obvious that we can and have engineered genetically less aggressive animals via breeding programs. To say that this sort of thing is absolutely categorically impossible in humans seems (fill in the blank).

Now one can posit that people naturally become more aggresive since this enables better rates of survival, or that less aggressive traits are encouraged since following law keeps one free to breed (to put forth two very simple opposing ideas). However it is working out, even if it is a wash overall, once you admit biological change somewhere you cannot go back and categorically deny it is happening.

I don't reject Darwinism. But Darwinism offers nothing to explain why man nature hasn't changed over all the years of his known existence. It only explains, at best, why his physicality has altered. Darwinism is about physical change, not emotional or intellectual change.

Breeding dogs to be less aggressive is not at all related to Darwinism. It's cross breeding, or in the case of plants, grafting. Besides, even the most docile dog will get snarly if you threaten its life or screw with its bone.  

So you can reject my analogy of a control panel subject to outside influences if you like. But the next time you feel lovingly about someone or flaming mad at someone, just ask yourself whether you brought it about internally or if some external event triggered your emotion. If you're honest with yourself, you'll see it was an external influence. And that, my friend, has been the condition of man since way, way back.

There's a pony in there somewhere. Can you explain it in simpler terms.

I wasn't talking about your personal beliefs, just throwing evolution out there. But evolution certainly does affect more than musculature and bone structure. The growth of one's brain and central nervous system is controlled by the same processes that control how long your fingers are, namely, your DNA. Or can it be explained how one's brain is somehow off-limits when it comes to evolution change? Even random mutation ought to affect one's brain somehow, somewhere.

Maybe I dont understand the distinction you draw between physicality (your body?), and emotion and intellect. But it seems to me at first glance that you deny these things are subject to changes in one's physical nervous system?

 
Breeding dogs to be less aggressive is not at all related to Darwinism. It's cross breeding, or in the case of plants, grafting. Besides, even the most docile dog will get snarly if you threaten its life or screw with its bone.  
 

I'd say it is. I could dissemble and say that while it isn't actually natural selection, the processes that force change upon the dog species have the same effect, making how the motive forces apply to the question of whether or not this thing is actually happening irrelevant, but the premise is just hubris (in the sense that humanity is a part of the natural world). Imagine you are outside of the dog-breeder's set and indeed it is natural selection.

Now, whether or not the most docile dog will attack in order to save it's own life may well be true. Are humans this way? No. There are many instances of people quietly awaiting their own sure death. How this applies to the questions in this thread I dont know, but its a fact.

 
So you can reject my analogy of a control panel subject to outside influences if you like. But the next time you feel lovingly about someone or flaming mad at someone, just ask yourself whether you brought it about internally or if some external event triggered your emotion. If you're honest with yourself, you'll see it was an external influence. And that, my friend, has been the condition of man since way, way back.
 

You could be right, but it doesnt speak to the idea that the outside influences required to make one react aren't changing in the mean. Does it take more or less pressure for a man today to commit murder than it did 5000 years ago? Who could say...

[/quote] Now one can posit that people naturally become more aggresive since this enables better rates of survival, or that less aggressive traits are encouraged since following law keeps one free to breed (to put forth two very simple opposing ideas). However it is working out, even if it is a wash overall, once you admit biological change somewhere you cannot go back and categorically deny it is happening.

 
There's a pony in there somewhere. Can you explain it in simpler terms.
 

Hmmm, pony? This flies over my head, lol.

Again, not speaking at yourself in that last sentence. This was an aside offering opposing(?) views to how natural selection might operate in modern society. One, that self-interest is encouraged as it allows one to amass wealth (security) and opportunity. Two, that docile behavior is encouraged as it enables one to live freely and avoid judgements. Finally, that any societal pressures that may be acting to influence the evolution of man may very well be cancelling themselves out.

BUT and this is the part that is probably unclear?

But if we can show that there has been change in man over time in history due to environment that has changed the very nature of the species, then to deny that it could continue today is certainly wrong. Now, I believe our intellect and emotion has its basis in our physical structure, and that if we say that our physical structure has evolved over time, then I have to admit to at least the possibility that our intellect and emotional make-up has likewise evolved in some manner. I did not suspect that there could be a difference between physical nature and intellect/emotion which would render the latter unchangeable, and in fact I still don't.

Does that help to clarify what I meant?
 
 
 
But evolution certainly does affect more than musculature and bone structure. The growth of one's brain and central nervous system is controlled by the same processes that control how long your fingers are, namely, your DNA. Or can it be explained how one's brain is somehow off-limits when it comes to evolution change? Even random mutation ought to affect one's brain somehow, somewhere.

 

Speaking of DNA, here's an interesting idea for you. Back in the 1970's, Timothy Leary of LSD fame wrote a serious book (never published to my knowledge, through drafts exist) which was titled Nurologic. Despite his jester reputation he was a highly accomplished behavioral scientist. In the book he explains that the DNA contains all the history of a living thing's evolution AND the instructions for its future evolution.

In humans he explains that we can trace man's evolution by observing
the various stages of embryonic growth today. During gestation, the embryo replicates years of evolution and we can see all the forms in which humans were born over many, many years. The stage at which a baby is now born represents the farthest advance of human evolution. But, get this! The DNA which controls the development of the embryo does not play out all the way. In other words, it's like a CD that stops at a certain point, but has more on it to play. And that unplayed part, Leary said is the instructions for man's future evolution. He wanted to devise a way to force the CD to play itself out so that we could see what man would look like in the very distant future... Pretty radical.

It is. So, you're a McCoy...do you know any Hatfields?   )

 

Anybody with a Mc or Mac in front of their name is kin of mine. Alas I'm not much chop on the feuding side of things, apart from my surviving sister who I'm going to have a hard time being polite to should we meet again I just really can't hold a grudge. Must have evolved eh?  
 
 
Sounds interesting, however whacked out he might have been. The attachment is unfortunately invalid.

Maybe a couple of years in Appalachia on a hard scrabble farm and a pint of shine every day will bring out the Mc in you. Then it's watch out, sis.

What was wrong with the attachment? It came from an unimpeachable source--wiki.

Ah, excuse me. It wasn't supposed to be linked. It illustrated the point about stages of the embryo, but each was a different species...

But here is a link that illustrates it better.

Did you know the ice sheet on the SOUTH pole is getting thicker because it's colder there now?

I think the world is getting worse because the next ice age will hit soon. Everything above the temperate zone will be covered by vast glaciers and millions of people will be forced to most to the tropics.

 

i think u r talking about the big freeze, which is still 10.000 years away

i was merely talking about the immediate future the next 30-years

& every body knows that in the Next 30-years there is going to be chaos all around due to melting of the polar ice.

No he's talking about right now. the Antarctic is getting colder.
 
 
Well, I guess things are looking up.

What does "better" mean? Contentment? Are people more content on the whole?

Contentment, happyness, satisfaction can be measured by how closely people fulfil their expectations. The greatest malcontentment exists where affluence rubs against deprivation. That's never been worse.

Whatever the Beatles sang, the Stones sang "I can't get no satisfaction"
