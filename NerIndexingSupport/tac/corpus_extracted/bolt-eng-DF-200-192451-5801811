Fairly simple question, if we supposedly have their opium under control, then who is funding their resistance movement?

Pakistan used to during the Soviet-Afghan war and so did Saudi Arabia.

Is Russia involved or even China?
 
 
Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, etc. It's not a resistant movement either, it's a terrorist organisation.
 
 
I heard it was the Saudi Royal family but I can't confirm this.
 
 
The opium output of afghanistan has increased since the start of the war so it is far from under control. As for who else is funding them probably Iran, some wealthy Saudis etc. The usual bunch that fund terrorist groups in the middle east
 
 
America  
 
 
Barack obama
 
 
Donald Trump.

He's such a bell-end sometimes.

I think you're more intelligent than Bateman. Please don't dismiss these sources as "Western propaganda" or any of that ballcocks. The IRI funds terrorists all over the world, including in Afghanistan, that is an undeniable fact.
 
 
America! I even know an afghan guy whos dad is high up in the Afghan parliment and claims everyone knows its America!
 
 
America during the Soviet Invasian. Maybe still America partly too carry on war on terror. Also Arab states.
 
 
I am  

I kid. They probably get funding from wealthy gulf Arab families, members of the Saudi Royal family, through frauds/embezzlement in the 'West' and elements within Pakistan.
 
 
This should help.....  http://blogs.reuters.com/global/2009...ge-1/#comments 
 
 
One source is opium (drugs) but it is not as simple as this no more.
The Taliban now has what the US Government call "sponsors"; people giving the Taliban money/weapons etc
Sponsors maybe Governments, organizations or simply high ranking businessmen.
Personally I think even with these sponsors there are elements of the opium trade still giving them huge amounts of cash.
Maybe the question should not be about where they are getting the money but where are they buying their weapons...
 
 
Probable earn a bit from the opium trade. They also own legal businesses secretly so money from there too. Governments and rich people obviously help them too. Maybe their friends with N Korea too lol

Heroes to whom precisely? (Apart from their own supporters).

As far as I know, most Afghanis appreciate that their country is heading toward democracy and the fact that their daughters can now go to school. Most of them don't want a return to the Taliban and their Islamofascism.
 
 
Do any of you think China could be funding them?

Afterall China(and other nations) are currently funding the US' "War on Terror", so it would only make sense to fund the opponents to keep it going for longer, thus raising the interest rate and in turn gaining more money.

They have many supporters though, we're not simply talking about 2 countries and a few million people, we could infact be talking about billions, who will side with these "terrorist organisations" etc simply because of their hate towards the West.

Perhaps, but not on the same scale as the Taliban, however they've had a lot of support from Irish-Americans and several governments.
 
 
Thos who say Arab states are still living in Hollywood movies! Arab states are fighting al qaeda on there own soil, why would they fund them? Places like Saudi, Egypt Algeria ect are fighting daily battles against Terrorists! If anything its America to carry on there war in Afghanistan or Iran to fight the Americans!

Wow, I've read so many of your posts and they seem so knowledgable, i'm quite suprised you said that.

Iran fund the taliban?
Pakistan? I know they have in the past, but now? Would be quite stupid. I know there are groups within Pakistan that might do - highly doubt it the state is.

A lot of people seem to think it may well be India. Might sound stupid on the face of it, but if you look at the situation in South Asia over the past 20 - 30 years and the India/Pak border etc., The fact Pakistan is supporting the west/USA (they dont really have a choice do they?) - the trouble the Taliban is giving them is stretching their army and resources. Only party to benefit from that would be India. Also an unstable Pakistan only benefits India and nobody else.

Even though the current conflict is being presented and thrown around as a religious one, I very much doubt it is the highest agenda on anyone's book besides the Taliban/Al-Qaeda. Everyone else is in it for themselves, their own economic and imperial interests.

During the Soviet invasion, the US and many other Western countries as well as Saudi provided funding and sometimes even manpower to the Pakistani intelligence services. This was then used to strengthen the various resistance groups (Taliban didn't exist) and train their fighters. After the Soviets withdrew, the US lost interest but felt the newly formed Taliban would keep Afghanistan stable. The Taliban continued to be supported by Pak, Saudi and the UAE while the rest of the world lost interest.

After 9/11 however, the Pak intellgence services were purged of Taleban supporters while the country was dragged into the war on terror. As Saudi and Pak are very close friends, this effectively rules out Saudi- a country also battling against Wahabbi militants. However I would definitely assume some members of the royal family secretely fund the Taleban.

To be Honest my main guess would definitely be India (Russia hates the Taleban and China loves Pak). There are currently over 300,000 Pakistani soldiers and a million Indian ones on the Line of control in Kashmir on the 2 countries border. However with Pak, the number used to be 400,000. In the 1980's and most recently by supporting the Baloch insurency, the Indians tried to divert Pak. troops from their border. Most likely than not they are attempting to the same now.

You didn't read the sources, did you?

There are many varied opinions on where the funding is coming from.

I was under the impression that the Taleban and Iran hated each other -  http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9809/....02/index.html 
 
 
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia most probably.

Supposedly our allies (Yeah right).
 
 
I've never thought about where they get their funding from before. Perhaps we would be more effective trying to stop the taliban from that angle. Then again if it's all a conspiracy with the US that ain't gonna happen.
 
 
isnt the asnwer to this question simple? im not one of them anti-american but its usa of course. they are the ones who founded both al-qaeda and the taliban? they first formed taliban to fight against the russians as they didnt have the gut to fight them. then used them to enter afghanistan. the same thing for al-qaeda to enter iraq. not relevant but i dont think any big countries are ready nor have the gut to fight with each other. they will only use little countries like georgia, armenia-azerbaijan etc to show their power to each other. or scare each other in other words.
 
 
Americans funded the IRA for years, thats what i do know

And then they ask for the UKs help with this?

Cheek!!
 
 
Iran (who are also funding in Iraq), India, Israel...perhaps Russia (to get back at the Americans)?
Most Gulf countries.
 
 
NATO, USA and UK used to fund them until 1990 in order to fight Soviet Union. I don't think that Russia would ever fund Taliban since they worked as NATO agents in soviet times and since they are connected to the Chechnya separatists.
 
 
We are funding the Taliban. We are also providing them the material for their bombs.

* Our troops guard the hydroelectric dam which provides electricity to the people of Helmand province but we don't guard the transmission wires and substations... the Taliban can thus tax the electricity households receive.

* International development organisations and reconstruction firms bribe Taliban to not attack them. They bribe them at the site where the reconstruction occurs and the supply convoys. The going rate is up to £350 per supply truck.

* The Department for International Development provides the population of Helmand province FREE wheat seed. The Helmanders all plant the free wheat and whamo.... the price of wheat plummets and the price of opium soara... next year guess what crop they will all grow? Taliban tax both wheat and opium sales.

* Department of International Development provide free wheat seed and free bags of fertiliser. The fertiliser is being used to create IEDs.

That is genuinely very interesting. Do you have a source by any chance?
 
 
It's all researchable on the Internet. Much can be worked out with the exercise of little grey cells.

Or you can just read  this .
 
 
Saudi Arabia and sections of the Pakistan military and intelligence services like the ISI(was Kasab not supposed to be trained by the ISI?). Doubt India would fund the Taliban, we have had too many problems with Islamic extremists over the years and the growth of the Taliban into Pakistan will only create bigger problems in Kashmir, not to mention the rest of the country.

I asked you for a link. Not a theory.
 
 
Did you read the link?
 
 
"Taliban" is a term that is used to explain all of the fighters in Afghanistan. There are loads of different groups that are fighting. The taliban that was in power until 2001 is funded by Pakistan and Saud Arabia. The groups that were fighting for the northern alliance are funded by Iran. Also, Opium production has actually increased since the invasion and they make a lot of their money from that.
 
 
pasargad, you're right the opium production is still significant but it is not the only source of funding. the protection racketeering of development agencies and Western reconstruction firms (give us money or we blow your sh!t up) is probably the most important source for the Taliban.

BTW that ex-Northern Alliance group is wound up in the Afghan government now. The Taliban group is the one that was funded by Pakistan.

On the original topic, I have no idea, certainly not American, probably independent businessmen rather than states. Pakistan and Iran never got on with the Taliban and had many skirmishes during their time in power.

I know it is not the only source of funding, hence why i said they recieve their funding from Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

Not all of the NA are in the government, there are still some off shoots of it that fight the west, and these people are likely to be the target of Iranian funding. Iran would never fund the Taliban. Iran has been having major border wars with them for decades. Iran has lost ~4000 soldiers fighting them since 1979.

The lecturer confused you. Obviously Islam and Nazism are two different things. Whoever said they were or could be the same thing? Any seminar on the discussion is inevitably going to conclude they are different.

The term "Islamofascism" does not mean Facism is Islam or Islam is Fascism. It refers to the way in which some Islamic groups have adopted behaviour and fashions of the Nazis. This includes teaching anti-semitism to children, spreading Jewish blood-libel, and encouraging a militaristic form of society.

For example, this image of Hamas supporters doing the Nazi salute.

 

Hitler's Mein Kampf was until recently (it may still be) the highest selling book in Egypt and Gaza. Islamofascism might not be the perfect phrase to use to describe this, but it's not that far off either.

The Taliban did not exist before 1993. What are you talking about?

Well no they don't. The Taliban are comprised almost entirely of Pashtuns.

Pakistan isn't funding them. The Pashtuns currently endanger Pakistan's nation security because Pakistan keeps its nuclear weapons in the disputed Pashtun regions.

Iran is unlikely to be funding the Taliban since the Taliban is Sunni Muslim and the Iranians are Shia.

Saudis are unlikely to be funding the Pashtuns either since the Pashtuns aren't friends with the Saudis.

There have been many artices claiming that Iran funds the Taliban, but like i said these news sources call all of the fighters by the same name.

Iran is fighting the Taliban and it does not make sense that they woud fund them. If Iranian weapons are found in the hands of the Taliban it does not mean Iran is funding them. Iran openly funded and armed the NA and there is no reason why those arms couln't have been sold or given to the Taliban since 2001.

You cannot make such claims without providing me with proof.
 
 
Iran probably does fund some groups in Afghanistan, however they are not the Taliban.

Are you aware of the phrase "the enemy of my enemy is my friend"? Very often in politics nationstates will employ that mindset to further their own ends. Iran may despise the Taliban but it despises the US and the War on Terror even more.

Of course i have heard of that phrase, however the Taiban are not the only group in Afghanistan that are fighting Nato. The Taliban are fighting Iran and Nato at the same time.

This is true, although the Iranian regime does it indirectly through different entities,but the groups are not there to undermine Karzai's Government. Rather to help Irans aims to fracture the relationship between Karzai and the US which seems to have been working, as seen recently when Karzai backed and supported the re-election of Ahmedinejad. Not to mention Iran increasing it's influence in Afghanistan over the last few years through economic investments by Iranian firms.
