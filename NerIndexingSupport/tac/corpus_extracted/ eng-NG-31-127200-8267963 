It's official. The scarred warrior is leaving for better pastures. 5
million euros, a financial net loss of some substance for Real Madrid.
At least Emerson could function as a tractor, not a brand new one, but
a tractor. Who will be in charge of making his many small fouls for
Real Madrid? Guti blows a fuse easily. Diarra is not such a fouler.
They need a gentle butcher.

I imagine Emerson is going to be a sub at Milan.

Best,
