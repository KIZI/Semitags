Former England defender Sol Campbell has joined Premier League newcomer Newcastle on a one-year contract.

Campbell links up with Newcastle manager Chris Hughton, who was a coach at Tottenham when Campbell joined the north London club at 14 years old.

Hughton says "I have known Sol since he was a lad at Tottenham and am fully aware of what he has to offer."

The 35-year-old Campbell was available on a free transfer after the expiry of his short-term contract with Arsenal.

Only David James, Ryan Giggs and Gary Speed have played more Premier League matches than Campbell.

Campbell won two Premier League titles with Arsenal and lifted the 2008 FA Cup with Portsmouth.
