China would like to participate in the the International Space Station, so
who has to give China the OK?

United States
Russia
France
Canada
Japan
...

All, One, a few? Is it truely an International Space Station? Is it on a
veto bases? Or, at the United States discretion? What's the reality, and
what should be the criteria?

The Chinese are commies. Ronald Raygun hated commies. End of discussion.
