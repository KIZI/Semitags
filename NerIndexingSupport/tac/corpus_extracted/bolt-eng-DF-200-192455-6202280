 
 
D&D Religion's "Ask About Judaism" Thread
 
 
This is a kind of sequel to "Ask a Muslim". If you have a question about Judaism or Jewish culture you would like to ask (including, indeed, what "Jew" really means), post it here and a Jewish user, or user familiar with Judaism, will have a shot at answering it.

As with "Ask a Muslim", this is intended to function simply as a place for Q&A to keep the rest of the forum clean and tidy.

Theoretically, recent posts that really belong here may be moved to this thread. Just to warn you.

Your feedback and comments are of course most welcome.

Finally, as with H&R, remember that all advice is unprofessional.
 
 
Thaks a lot Agent Smith. But I hope, in near future,you will start a sticky "Ask an atheist" -- because I have whol lots of questions to them!

As for Ask a Jew, I have some interesting questions -- but I will ask only after I have studied Judaism a little more.
A light start - are Jew girls prettier than non-Jews?  
 
 
To Jewish boys, certainly.  

I expect JonH will, upon spotting this thread, spam us all to within an inch of our lives with pics of IDF girls, who are indeed far from ugly, but the truth is that I have absolutely no idea about the general, er, standard.
 
 
IDF gals are slammin... and yeah, ask an atheist would be a good thread to sticky.
 
 
I'm wary of letting these "Ask" threads snowball. I might be able to get away with limiting it to four (Abrahamics plus Atheo-agnosticism), but drawing the line is hard and in addition, having four stickies at the top kind of undermines the very aim of "keeping the subforum unclogged".

I'll try to keep an eye on the apparent demand for such a thread. Ditto a Christianity-based counterpart.

Nathan raised a thread titled "TSR Christian apologetics" on Religion sub-forum but it was never made into a 'sticky'.

If you can find it - it was used within the last couple of weeks from memory - you might want to use that.
 
 
It had occured to me, yes. Did that ever become a TSR Society?

No, it didn't. It's just 'resurrected' every now and again as people come across it.

Here's the link:

 http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=266375 

Could you just remove the word "society" from the OP title and make it a sticky, please?
 
 
Whoa, slow down. I'm not sure there's demand for it right now. Like I said, I'll keep an eye on the number of questions being raised, OK?

You're rushing me

You said the same thing, more or less, on that linked thread (post #9). We have far more questions about Christianity than we do about Islam or Judaism...and besides, it keeps D&D more tidy.  

I'm won't rush you though...you've got until Friday!

I was wondering what IDF girls stand for - Israeli Defence Girls
they are slammin!
 
 
The apologetics group did become a society! 20 members last count.

Probably not the right place, but I would be more than happy to answer questions in an "Ask the godless heathen scum" thread. In fact even if it won’t be stickied I’m almost tempted to start one. After my exams though.
 
 
Ok to make this thread a little more effiicient and user-friendly to us all, could a mod please ensure that there is no chat, and that all posts on this thread are on-topic and are questions relating to Judaism. Otherwise it's just going to get confusing. Already it has been spammed up and I personally don't have the time to read through a load of chat. So would it be possible to erase the above posts now? When I have more time I will make a list of FAQs and myths to be inserted into the first post that have previously been asked all over the forum and it'd be easier to keep it in one place. Good good.

And to answer the first question, yes, Jewish girls and Jewish boys are very pretty and handsome.
 
 
Just wondering what views Jews on this forum have on Sacha Baron Cohen, in particular his 'Borat' alter-ego?
 
 
O.K I heard this somewhere: Jews believe that God created the earth in six days (which is the same belief as with Christians and Muslims) but they also believed that He got tired on the 6th day.
Is that true?
 
 
Not exactly "tired". I believe the Jewish and Christian traditions are the same on this matter; He simply rested. Which I suppose does imply tiredness, but it's not explicitly stated.

I don't think it is, anyway.
 
 
I have a question for a jew. Apple or orange juice?

No my friend, that's Israeli girls, a big difference to a jewish girl! IDF girls are fine, too fine, and don't I know it  
 
 
Question:

Why didn't the Jews think Jesus was the Messiah ?
 
 
That's one for Gemma's FAQ, right enough. But until she gets round to doing it, I'd guess they just don't see him/Him as fulfilling the prophecies?

It was that question that i asked which led to the whole Ask a Jew saga

Hehehe!
 
 
Oh, deary me. Can we consider that question answered and move on, please? Reluctantly...  
 
 
Im not a Jew but this is what i believe is referred to about the Messiah

The moshiach will be a great political leader descended from King David (Jeremiah 23:5). The moshiach is often referred to as "moshiach ben David" (moshiach, son of David). He will be well-versed in Jewish law, and observant of its commandments. (Isaiah 11:2-5) He will be a charismatic leader, inspiring others to follow his example. He will be a great military leader, who will win battles for Israel. He will be a great judge, who makes righteous decisions (Jeremiah 33:15). But above all, he will be a human being, not a god, demi-god or other supernatural being.

It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the moshiach. If the time is right for the messianic age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the moshiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the moshiach, then that person is not the moshiach.

What i now want to ask - is why the Jews think that Christians accepted Jesus as the Messiah if it was obvious that those passages in the Torah werent referring to Jesus?

Regards, Asad
 
 
Also another question previously mentioned here. Why would God need to rest? It seems ridiculous to suggest the Supreme Creator would need to rest? Sorry if im showing ignorance, but isnt that what the sabbath is about?

He doesn't literally "rest". It's not like he sat on a cloud and had a cup of tea.

---

I've got a question:

Are the 613 Commandments viewed as moral (rather than legislative) commandments and as such considered still true (as in it is still true that we ought to do X, Y, Z). If not, why not?
 
 
Wow I have my work cut out here.

Sacha Cohen is a silly billy but I personally think he's very funny in Borat. There are three problems in Kazakstan; social, economic and Jew.  

G-d didn't get tired. G-d didn't rest. G-d simply abstained from creating on the seventh day. G-d is G-d, how can he get tired? Similarly, Jews observe Shabbat on the seventh day and imitate G-d by not creating; it's nothing to do with resting. Common misconception.

Jews don't believe Jesus is the Messiah because we believe the Messiah is going to be descended from King David. Nowhere in Jewish scriptures is Jesus mentioned.. it's like asking why isn't Joe Bloggs the Messiah, ya? Truth is, we don't know who is the Messiah but as someone already said there are a few potentials in each generation and when the time is right, then he/she will come.

Jews are hot.

Apple juice.

I'm not quite sure what you're asking here... Want to just clarify in case I answer the wrong question?
 
 
Thanks gems  
 
 
No probs.  
 
 
What is the etiquette with writin G-d instead of God? What difference does it make? I have seen Jewish faith sites doing that too.

We are told not to write G-d's name in vain and by using the dash instead of the "o" it means if the name gets destroyed by accident/on purpose then it won't be violating that commandment. It doesn't necessarily apply online because you can't really destroy it but it seems tradition to do so anyway. It mainly applies to on paper.
 
 
Why do you feel the need to imitate God? Did He tell you to?

We are told to observe Shabbat.

EDIT: By observing Shabbat, we are showing that we recognise G-d created the world in six days.
 
 
What took Him so long ?

2nd part.
 
 
Well done Gemz. You appear to be doing a fantastic job in here - managing v.well all by yourself. Good girl. Keep it up. I'm awaiting all your replies with anticipation.  
 
 
Yeh. 6 days is a long time for someone who has infinite power. Anything more than an instant can only be accounted for by muchos procrastinating on TSR. Tut tut.
It can happen to the best of us.  
 
 
Judean People's Front, etc. etc.

So what happened to the other prospective Messiahs? Did they simply haemorrhage believers to Jesus and fade away?
 
 
The following are just a few examples of how Judiasm means that all people are in it together, as a community or one big happy family, and not just living as individuals as some people appear to think. re. the 'Question about Jewish Faith thread.'
I had 10minutes spare today during lunch so decided to sit down and type up some stuff off the top of my head just for you folks to enjoy.

--- Whilst the High Holy Days mark the beginning of the change in date in each Jewish year (e.g. from 5767 to 5768), the beginning of the Jewish calendar is with the month 'Nissan' in which the exodus from Egypt took place. The main purpose of Passover (the festival commemorating this event) is so that ''each generation must see itself as if it came out of Egypt.''
'
-- Indeed, anyone vaguely familiar with the Passover service will know of the '4 Sons', one of whom is the 'wicked son.' Why is he designated as wicked? Because he asks the question ''what does this service mean to you?'' i.e. To you, and not him. By excluding and segregating himself out from the rest of the Jewish people he is considered a heretic.

-- Maimonides takes this further by stating that one who observes all the commandments with diligence yet does not fast with the rest of the Jews when they are pained, or does not rejoice in their joy when they all celebrate has no place in the World to Come.

-- Many other religions encountered G-d through one man, one specially chosen prophet e.g. Jesus, Mohammed and Buddha. However, Judaism is the only religion in which G-d met all the people. 600,000 stood at Mt Sinai when we were given the Torah and G-d Himself spoke the first two of the 10 commandments to us.
 
 
 
who for one reason or another was more convincing than other false messiahs.
 

Yeh, Resurrection kinda makes a man convincing  
 
 
If your faith is such that you believe it occurred.

Hmmm... interesting. So you saying God spoke to the entire population about the first 2 commandments at the time of Moses PBUH?
And on what basis do you claim that? Like any verse from Torah or is it a historical thing?

But undoubtedly, the first two commandments form the most integral part of all three religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
Talking about common terms between you and the rest -- Say there is no deity worthy of worship except One Supreme God.

We have something similar with the name "Allah" in Arabic, it's not that we can't write it but we can't destroy something which has the name "Allah" on it, to get around that we first have to erase it or separate letters from each other.

Um.... is that going off-topic?

Oh yeah and is it O.K. here if I put verses of the Qur'an to shown what Muslims believe about Moses and tribe of Israel... or should I do that in "Ask A Muslim" instead?

If your faith is such that you believe it occurred.
 

Or the history is such that we can identify it as the motivation behind early Christian messianic labels

Depends what the question is. If you want to offer a Muslim perspective here I suppose that's OK, but please do try not to take over too much of the thread. If someone asks you what Muslims believe about the Israelites and Moses, then that's clearly "Ask a Muslim" material.

Died on the cross, yes. Resurrected within Jewish eschatology, no they weren't. Immaculately conceived refers to Mary's sinlessness, but I won't be pernickety, I know what you mean   - miraculous births maybe, technical, incarnational virgin birth, no.

Although please cite them if you know them?

Actual verse from the Torah. Exodus, Chapter 20, Verse 1.
''And G-d spoke all these words saying...*insert the 10commandments* ''
Then, in Verse 16 it states ''and they [the people] said to Moses: You speak with us and we will listen, but let not G-d speak to us lest we die.''

Nowt to do with the first two commandments being 'more important.' But yes, the three main monotheistic religions are Judaism, Christinity and Islams. Furthermore, they all worship the same G-d albeit through differing methods/with differing names.
 
 
^Why does God talk in 3rd person ?

You know it's very hard to track and research the actual Torah that you believe bcause of the dominating nature of Christian Bible.
Anyway, the people did not actually climb Mount Sinai, did they (exodus 19:20-25)? It was Moses PBUH that God spoke to and he delivered the message by going down to them.

So in 20:1 we see Moses PBUH deivering the message:
God spoke all these words.....

The conveying continues till 20:14. In 20:15 people saw the sounds, the flames. I assume some people out of their curiosity tried to climb Sinai.
Then as in 20:16 we find people saying to Moses:
You speak to us... if He does.

Now according to many, this is in chronological order, and they asked Moses after the giving of the Ten Commandments (Mekhilta; Rashbam; Ibn Ezra, Abarbanel, on Exodus 20:15). Others say that this was before the Ten Commandments (Ramban). According to others, the people said this to Moses after the Second Commandment, and the rest were given through Moses (Chizzkuni; Exodus 20:7).

So you actually fall into the last of the three groups who believe that God stopped speaking to people after first two Commandments.

But I doubt the first and last group. The people were unworthy of listening to God Almighty directly. And God brought Moses above his people by speaking to him -- he was made worthy. Ramban seems to make more sense than others in this regard.
It is better to say God gave the ten commandments to the people through Moses.Nothing exaggerating.

I think these kind of things would fit in pretty well in the Interfaith thread - see sig.

I'll do it again for you now.

*throws hands in air*
Hey! Nothing to do with me mate! They're the largest religion in the world - not surprising they've more stuff on the web!  

 
Anyway, the people did not actually climb Mount Sinai, did they (exodus 19:20-25)?
 

I never implied that they did so don't see where you're coming from.  

 
In 20:15 people saw the sounds, the flames. I assume some people out of their curiosity tried to climb Sinai.
 

Deliberately taking this out of the main thing as this is a seperate point.

They didn't. They'd been warned on two separate occasions not to - see 19.12 and also 19.21-24.
The smoke and flames in 20.15 - see the description of Mount Sinai in 19.16-19.

 
It was Moses PBUH that God spoke to and he delivered the message by going down to them.

So in 20:1 we see Moses PBUH deivering the message:
God spoke all these words.....

The conveying continues till 20:14.
 

You're mixing up two entirely different incidents - don't worry - it's a fairly easy mistake to make if you're not familiar with the text.

The message as described in your first sentence refers to 19.21-24. Hence verse 25 it states 'Moses descended to the people and said to them.'

Now, I assume you have a text in front of you - if not you'll need to look one up on the 'net coz I'm not able to reproduce it here. Hebrew-English translations of the Torah (google that and not just 'bible') are easy to find.
In between Chapters 19 and 20 there is a large gap/a hebrew letter looking similar to 'O' - this depicts the end of one chapter and the beginning of the next. Hence, here, the events in Chapters 19 and 20 are entirely separate - and in your post you combined them as one.

*am just replying to the second half of your post*

Not quite. Argh this is so complicated to explain.

Look in Deutronomy 5:4 where Moses, in his farewell speech to the Children of Israel again describes Mt.Sinai and the verse states:
''Face to face did G-d speak with you on the mountain, from admidst the fire.''
Further on in 5.19-28 ''These words (the 10 commandments) G-d spoke to your entire congregation..'' (V.19)
''We have heard His voice..this day we saw that G-d will speak to a person and he can live.'' (V.21) - in here, the elders are talking to Moses at Mt.Sinai - then, if you look more into the text, it narrates that they asked Moses to speak to G-d and then relate back to them what he sais because G-d's greatness was too much for them to bear. G-d heard what they said, all was jolly, the Children of Israel returned to their tents and G-d told Moses everything else.
That's the actual etxt as stated in the Torah and thus all commentators (i.e. your whole list plus many more are all in agreement with the above).

***
Look again at your text and in particular, the phraseology of the first two commandments - in the 1st person. The rest are in the 3rd person. (Invocation..is this what you're talking about?) - hence the source for the commentators that say G-d spoke the first two only to the people (also inc. Rambam and Onkelos - you didn't quote them)

****

Now -Look again at your text and in particular, the phraseology of the first two commandments - in the 1st person. The rest are in the 3rd person. (Invocation..is this what you're talking about?) - hence the source for the commentators that say G-d spoke the first two only to the people (also inc. Rambam and Onkelos - you didn't quote them).
Ramban states that Onkelos writes that the people heard the first two commandments, although, as they were not as holy as Moses they did not comprehend it on the same level.

****

OK. Now, whether the people understood all 10/first 2/none of the commandments for what they were is what is being debated by the commentators. However, there is no dispute amongst any of them that G-d did not speak in front of all 600,000people as I have explained above.

Hope you understand that - took me an awfully long time to type out!
 
 
If you want a non-Christian version of the Bible then check out  http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0.htm  or invest in an Artscroll Tanakh which is a lot more modern and cuts out the "thy" "thee" "thou" etc etc.  
 
 
Ok. You people gave me a lot to study! I will be back after I am done with them and my ongoing exams  
Thanks for your response. I appreciate and acknowledge that Judaism makes more sense to me than Christianity in terms of things relating to God.

But you people make it kinda secret-looking.
Have fun  
 
 
From the Israeli Wikipedia:

Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon (aka Rambam or Maimonides) is the only Jewish adjudicator who related to it:

 
"And if a king from the house of David (king David) will rise and he will study Torah and will follow the Torah commandments as David his father (ancestor), both of the Torah and the Orally Torah and will force all the nation of Israel to follow the Torah, and will fight the wars of God - then he is as a Messiah. If he will do that and if he will succeed and if he will win all the nations around Israel and if he will built the temple in it's place and if he will gather all the rest of the Jews to Israel then he is the Messiah for sure." (Halachos kings and their wars, chapter 11, Halacha 8)
 

In the words of the Rambam there are signs to identify someone who is as a Messiah and someone who is a Messiah for sure. A man who is as a Messiah is a man who these things are valid regarding him:

1. He is from the sperm of the house of David (king David)

2. Follow the commandments of the Torah and the Orally Torah and force the nation of Israel to follow them.

3. Is fighting the wars of God.

The one who do these 3 things above and also the 3 things below is a Messiah for sure:

1. Will win the nations around Israel

2. Will built the temple

3. Will gather all the rest of the Jews to Israel.

End of the translation from Israeli Wikipedia.
 
 
Are you saying this is how Rambam explained the advent of the Messiah?

What is this Halacha?

Think so yes. Rambam is a major Jewish commentator.

Halacha is the Hebrew term for "law."
 
 
Hold on. i thought jewish law is referred to as Halakhah which is similar to Islamic law called Shariah.
 
 
It's just a different spelling. Halakhah, Halacha etc.
 
 
Halacha is merely "Halakhah" transliterated better

english people cant say "ch" for the most part so its done softly.
 
 
Damn you helen.
 
 
Yeh it's not actually pronounced like the "ch" in "chair." But it's like Ha-la-ha. But the "ha" should be throaty! Like HalaHHHHHHHHa.
 
 
Oh yeah first let me ask, what do Jews believe about Moses (pbuh)? Do you believe he is a prophet and servant of God or something else?

I think the "ch" you're talking about is the same as the h in arabic... in Ra h man... or Mu h ammad. Ya it is throaty.... it's like the sound some people make when they touch something very hot... they go "a h "  

Oh yeah that responds to nathan when he said it's not muhammad it's machmad.
 
 
hahahahahaha  
i guess its like french pronunciation of y!

but Jewish law is easier  

So how are the laws derived? directly from Torah? or some Jewish scholar issuing it based on Torah?

brother morsey, I think  www.jewfaq.org  is a very good website answering basic questions and principles of Judaism.

A leader, a prophet... yet not just a normal prophet. Moses was said to have a fully clear vision regarding prophecies from G-d whereas other prophets such as Daniel for example would have a more blurred vision.

And yeah a bit like the H in Muhammed.

brother morsey, I think  www.jewfaq.org  is a very good website answering basic questions and principles of Judaism.

 

They're derived directly from the Torah (written law) and the Talmud (oral law). The Talmud discusses the laws and lists possible scenarios and then different Jewish scholars or commentators kind of finalise the law. Some laws are a bit ambiguous you see... and it's hard to apply them to all situations. And yeah jewfaq rox.
 
 
The Jewish law conatain couple of things: the Torah commandments, the Orally Torah and it's discussion in the Talmud and in the Gemara. You can't read and understand the Torah without the Orally Torah which is passed from Moses to the great Rabbis of today. In the intro of Shulchan Aruch you can find all the rabbis that the Orally Torah was passed to them from Moses who receivced it from God.

Although God spoke the Torah to all the nation but Moses taught it to the olders and to the wise and to the judges and they are the scholar ones. For example, the saying: "Eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth isn't about revenge but about money compensation between a Jew to another Jew. You can't understand it from reading in the Torah, you must have the Orally Torah to understand it. Another example is the receptions of Abraham to the envoys and the reception of Laban to Jacob. Abraham and his wife made them food and Laban kissed Jacob but the Orally Torah is telling us that Laban kissed Jacob because he wanted to search for jewels in his mouth.
 
 
So how come all that stuff - extra details that, from what you're saying, can often put a whole new twist on Torachic lore - isn't in the written version?

At Mount Sinai the Jews were given the Torah in its entirety. This consists of both the Written Torah (the OT) and the Oral Torah (now written down as the Mishnah). The Gemara is the explanation/D&D on the Mishnah.

Now, we were always meant to study both the Oral and Written Torah together - coz, as Jacobface above said - using the Written Torah alone wouldn't make much sense. e.g. 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'.

Ok. Could you please explain once more what is the difference between Jews and Jewish people? (In a simple manner for non-Jews to understand   )

If there is no difference, why bother using two terms?
From what I understand, Jews are people all over the world who follow Judaism but they may come from a Mexican tribe or any other tribe/race? And I am pretty sure I am wrong

They're synonyms. It's like saying "English" and "English people."
 
 
and children of Israel?

what if a child from Israel converts into Christianity? Is he by any means a Jew or Jewish people?
 
 
He's still considered jewish, but a heretic. (assuming he was a jewish child from israel   )

Another synonym.

Yes because he's still biologically Jewish.
 
 
so anyone from Africa enbracing Judaism is a Jew or one of the Jewish people?
(but not a child of Israel)

Eh? You're only a Jew/Jewish person/child of Israel if your mother is or if you convert.

No, jewish heritage is defined through the mother.

If your mother is a jew, then you are. If not then you aren't.

It doesnt depend which tribe you were from etc these days, although I see where you're coming from  
 
 
Justintabib - why the curiousity with Judaism? Have you got a hidden motive? Just an innocent question.

Jew and Jewish people are merely synonyms just like english and english people. They all believe in Judaism.

So why would you still call him Jewish even after he converts to another religion? Bilologically Jewish?  
For other religions, there is no term like biologically Christian or Muslim or Hindu. (even though Muslims believe everyone is born a Muslim - i.e. a submitter to God but his environment and parents influence him to be otherwise).
So is this exclusive for Judaism? Anyone born in a Jewish family will forever be Jewish no matter which religion he decides to follow later?

Because once your mother is Jewish so are you. It's matrilineal. And so biologically Jewish, for wanting of a better word.
 
 
What if your mother converts from Judaism, do you stop being Jewish? In the event she originally converted to Judaism rather than had a Jewish mother.

  I'll leave you to guess on that.

Just attempting to unfold the religion of Judaism, it's to me an exclusive, secret religion.   And I dont want to hear people telling me that just because I was born and bred into a Muslim family made me a Muslim.  

And I have heard this thing so many times: we need to create a bridge between all three monotheistic religions. I think the bridge is already there. We just need to help each other out!

But the moment I take a deeper look into Christianity, their beliefs of Jesus died for our sins and he is son of God, pulls me off big time. Judaism is more appealing and it's like a pearl being uncovered  .

If she was born Jewish - then all her offspring are Jewish.
If she converted in - it depends on how she converted. Do you know if it was an Orthodox or a Reform conversion? The latter doesn't go according to Jewish law so isn't accepted by Orthodoxy.

I was just being hypothetical to get Gem to admit it is just a traditional belief will no logical reason. There is nothing culturally wrong with that but I wanted to show it is pointless trying to explain the thinking behind it!

That's what I was talking about. If I am converting to Judaism tomorrow, I will be a Jew/Jewish/child of Israel (though my mother is not Jewish)?

But samba seems to differ.

Do I get a passport for Israel as well?
 
 
You get a Jew Peter badge

Because Judaism isn't a religion but a nation, an identity. A Jew is someone who belongs to the tribe of Judah/children of Israel. It's like a British who lives in Japan will always will be a British. He may be a Japanese citizen but he will always be British. A Jew is someone that his mother is Jew.

Christianity and Islam are religions which were forced upon many nationalities. The Jews who are living in all the countries of the world are belong to one nation, one family and they all came from one place.

Judaism is a nationality, an identity.

 
"and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation."
 

 
"and have set you apart from the nations, that ye should be Mine."
 

The Jewish nation is made up of the Jews living in all the countries in the world. They left Israel when they were exiled by the Romans 2000 years ago. There's no such thing as 'Islamic nation'/'Christian nation'; there's an Islamic religion/Christian religion. A Muslim in Britain has no genetic connection to a Muslim in China. A Jew in Britain has a genetic connection to a Jew in China; they are from the same family, from the same nation. Britain and China are the names of the descendants of Noah: Tubal and Cin. The countries in the world are named after the descendants of Noah. The Jews are children of Israel. A Jew in Libya doesn't feel like a Muslim in Libya. Jews also have a country and this is why they are a nation and not a religion. The Jews are descendants of Judah but the Muslims are not descendants of Islam and Christians are not decsendants of Christianity. That term describes a situation and not a nation. You can find Muslims and Christians from many nations, but the Jews who are living in their countries belong to one nation, the Jewish nation, and they feel like strangers in these countries.

 
"I'm going home," says British-born Sharon. "It's a place that I have wanted to go for many years. My mother is Israeli and our family have survived there for many years in difficult times. But I am also going for the good times."
 

 
"To say you are a Jew because of your religion is not the whole story. You are part of a people with a shared history and culture. It's the story of a Jewish civilisation to want to return to Israel."
 

 
"I know we have our Jewish community here but Israel, its environment is much larger. I don't want people to think that I am some kind of religious zealot, because I'm not, but Israel has kedushah - a holiness of the soil - that makes me feel closer to God."
 

 
"We believe that this is our country we are going to and that gives us protection. I could get on the Tube tomorrow here in London and the risks are the same."
 

 
People are wonderful to you," he says. "You're not a 'bloody immigrant' - none of that talk you get here in England. You're someone coming home who hears: 'Baruch haba! Welcome here!

"In America, we are living on borrowed time. This isn’t really our home. The one and only place a Jew can be a Jew without explaining anything is Israel. That is our true home, our history, and our holidays,"

"According to Ben, Dan was very sensitive to questions of double loyalty that inevitably arose with a kippah-wearing Jewish-American ambassador at the helm. “In the American administration, they always claim that it’s never clear where the Jews’ loyalty lies. When my brother was appointed ambassador to Cairo, the Egyptian press called him ‘Israel’s second ambassador’. When people would ask me who I’m more loyal to, I would always say that if, G-d forbid, a war would break out between the United States and Israel, I would fight on the Israeli side."

People who are Jews will remain Jews forever, even if they abandon their history and start to believe in other things If they assimilate, their children won't be Jews and won't be born as Jews. So you may ask what about the ones who 'convert to Judaism'? Well, they don't convert but join the Jewish nation. They are equal in the eyes of the Jews and they are allowed to marry Jews but they are not Jewish but Ger Zedek and will remain as Ger Zedek for the rest of their lives. Their descendants, given Jewish partners, will be considered as Jews.

It's like Chelsea Clinton will always be the daughter of her parents, even if tomorrow she will believe that she is a daughter of aliens, it doesn't matter. Forever she will be the daughter of her parents.

Look, even Christians and Muslims define themselves as their nations. George Bush, he may be a devoted Christian but when he is asked who he is he says that he is an American.

Ahmadinejad was asked if he would change the name of the Persian gulf to the "Islam Gulf" and he said that he will never do it.

People don't born as Christians, people don't born as Muslims.
People are raised as Christians and raised as Muslims.
They are all Noachides, who are decsendatns of Noach.
In the same way that  Jim Long  was raised as Christian but he always was a Noachide and now he returned to his true identity.

If you convert properly (which on average takes 3 years) then yes you will be a Jew/Jewish/Child of Israel.

You can get an Israeli passport no matter what religion you are - if you're an Israeli citizen....just like most other normal countries in the world.

Rob - could you expand on how it's a 'traditional belief with no logical reason' ?

Well the conversion process takes quite a long time (if it's Orthodox) so probably not, but eventually, yes.

  Not unless you want one. But you can get one of those now if you wanted...

You can be also an Arab citizen of Israel, so what? I'm not talking about a citizenship now.

From the Israeli Wikipedia:

 
In the Sages of blessed memory we can find 2 voices regarding the position of the Gerim. From one side we can find expressions like "The Gerim are hard for Israel as a psoriasis" (Talmud Bavly, Yabamot 47-2) and in other side the Gerim Zedek are mentioned together with the saintly and the hassids and the writters in the nation of Israel that the one who is praying is ask for mercy for them (mercy for all the nation of Israel). The continue of this debate is in the question if a Ger can say in the Parsha Mikra Bikurim the sentence: "Our God and the God of our fathers" or is it that the fathers of the nation - Abraham, Isaac and Yaakov, are consider to be his ancestors (Mishna, Masechet Bikurim, 1-4). The opinion of the Mishna is that the Ger brings Bikurim (first fruits) but he isn't reading, but in the Talmud Yerushalmi there's the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda that a Ger brings the Bikurim and he is allowed to read it and the fathers of the nation are consider to be his fathers also. In the main dabate there is the issue if the Jewish nation is a family that carries a genetic information from one generation to another and the Ger isn't part of this family or is it that the Jewish family is created because of sharing of ideas and common values and above all the belief in one God that taught the Torah to the nation of Israel and to the whole world. Rabbi Yehuda Halevi is showing in a clear way in the book HaKuzari the approach that the friendship in the Jewish nation is an internal "family" issue which relates, according to him, to a specialness that rans in the nation of Israel from a generation to generation since first Adam through Noach and the 3 fathers: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and this is what he says: "And all the ones who will arrive to us from the forearms in particular will arrive because of the favor that God did to us, but he will not be equal with us." and in the other hand, Rambam is writting to Ovadia Ger Zedek that: "There is no difference at all between you and me... (the 3 dots are the origin) and your origin shouldn't be less in your opinion....If we are relating to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob then you are relating to the one who said that the world was." The approach of Rabbi Yehuda Halevi was the main approach in the Kabbalah untill the time that the Kabbalah of the Haa"ri (Rabbi Yitzhak Loria) spreaded. The teaching of Haar"i, with the main emphasis on the "raising of the shinnings", saw in the souls of the Gerim as souls that in the basis of them they are souls of Israel that were rolling in the nations (which means origin Israeli souls that could have been assimilated etc) and according this teaching the process of the Giur is a process in which souls that carry the specialness of Israel are returning to the Jewish nation.
 

And by thy way, in the Israeli ID, there's no mention to your religion but to your nationality (HaLeom). Untill 2003 the nationality of the citizens of Israel was written in the Israeli ID, if you were Jew then it was written 'Jew', if you were an Arab then it would written 'Arab' (it doesn't matter if you are a 'Christian Arab'), but since 2003 it's not written no more but it's blank.

My ID, the HaLeom field is empty:

 

The ID of the oldest citizen of Israel, an Arab (Whom I think is a Christian) and it's written 'Arab':

 

 From this video 

They converted aren't Jews cause they didn't born to the Jewish tribe. They are Ger Zedek.

How nice. I was actually responding to the post made by Justintabib - which is why I quoted him and why my post was a direct answer to his questions.  
 
 
Can I ask a different question? Well, actually more than one

1. Kosher - do all the Jews here keep the Kashrut laws, and to what extent? I am seriously thinking about conversion to Judiasm, and that seems one of the most obvious things that would affect my life if I were to do so. Is it easier just to be vegetarian, for example?

2. Hebrew - is it difficult to learn? I only ask because I've applied to read Jewish Studies at University, and I'm beginning to panic about it being too difficult!

Thanks

Yes you can.

'here' meaning TSR? Depends on whom.
'here' meaning the big outside world? Depends on whom.
Heck no - why on earth would you want to be a veggie? Think of all that amazing food you're giving up! Just coz we have laws about how to prep. the meat doesn't mean it's difficult to eat it! I have meat every single day! (at lunchtimes FYI). Tbh it depends on where you live - if you live where a Jewish community is, then no it's not difficult at all coz there'll be kosher butchers. If you live in the back end of nowhere then yes it might be a wee problem.

2. Modern Hebrew - is supposed to be one of the more easy languages to learn. Basically, there's not that much irregular/exceptions like there is in English. There's past,present and future tense and maybe one more but that's it. The only slight problem is that it's a gender language which can get rather annoying at times.
Biblical Hebrew - isn't spoken anymore, you just learn how to translate from BH into English. Again, see above - not that difficult. Only thing is that it's a different script but once you've mastered that it's not bad at all. Nice regular unsurprising lang.

Out of interest - which uni? And why do you want to convert?

There is no such thing as "Biblical Hebrew", It's pure 100% Hebrew and it's not different than "today Hebrew".
 
 
I can't really explain why I want to convert. I just find Judaism makes a lot of sense; I kind of find it comforting. But conversion would be quite difficult at the minute, living in the middle of nowhere. The nearest Jewish community is about 50 miles away and it's not massive.

And the course is at UCL. The grammatical thing doesn't concern me so much as the alphabet. I have a good understanding of German, for example, so the gender issue wouldn't be too unfamiliar but a whole new alphabet seems quite a challenge

Think of it as Shakespearian English and Modern English.

Just posted in response to a similar question, but nevermind. I suppose I am Christian as I went to a Church of England school when I was younger but my family don't have any particularly strong beliefs - Dad's an atheist, Mum's more into the pagan thing.

Judaism seems to make a lot of sense to me, and I think I find it welcoming. A lot of the things I find confusing about Christianity seem to make more sense in light of Judaism (ie. the whole Jesus is the son of God thing, which I've never understood) Saying that, I would never convert until I'd learnt a lot more about the religion. I'd much rather just have an interest in Judaism, than convert half-heartedly

hmmm... I expected something similar to that.  

And there are hundreds of others on the same boat as you whether they confess or not. But have you considered how Jews view Jesus?
Do not rush into conversion before you are fully aware of the consequences (just an advice). may you be guided. ameen

Yeah you really do need to learn in depth before making a decision because conversion is a massive committment. Plus you can't really do an Orthodox conversion unless you really ARE committed. My advice is to keep asking questions, learn, research, attend J-Soc events at uni and see what you think. Don't rush into anything.

Not true!

Hebrew isn't your mother language so don't teach me about Hebrew!

The comparison that you made isn't correct. You have to learn how to read Shakespearian whilst you don't have to learn how to read the Hebrew in the Tanach. When I started to learn Torah lessons in first grade in elementry school, the teachers didn't give us a "course of Bibilical Hebrew" but we read in the Tanach in the same way that we read in other books.

The words and the syntax in the Tanach are the same like Hebrew that the Israelis are speak in the streets.

And again, you don't know Hebrew and you didn't learn Hebrew from the start so don't teach me about Hebrew!

If you want then I can give you proofs from sentences from the Tanach to prove the truth.
 
 
You don't have to learn to read Shakespearean English. You just have to think a little bit about each word. I'd imagine the same is true of Torachic Hebrew, only more so because of the enormously increased time gap. I simply do not believe that the language has changed so little in 5,700 years that modern Hebrew speakers can read the Tanach fluently.

People don't need to be taught ''how to read Shakespearian'' - it's English, albeit an older version.
Similarly, the language the Israelis speak on the streets today is Hebrew, albeit a more modern version of the one used in the Tanach etc.

If you want I can give you examples..in fact, regardless if whether you want it or not I'll give you one here and now.  

And he said (in Biblical Hebrew) = Va'yo'mer. = 1 word.
And he said (in Modern Hebrew) = V'hu Omar. = 2 words.

Hence - BH and MH is like Shakespearian and Modern English. Both are correct, both are similar yet they differ slightly and come from different eras.

They basically can. Think of it as ooo...I dunno... let's think of an analogy - like Shakespearian and Modern English.
I can pick up a S'peare play and read it. They can pick up a Tanach and read it.

It doesn't matter what you believe or not.

The things that matters are that the language in the Tanach is pure Hebrew that 6 years old are reading in elementry school.

Let me give you an example from the first sentences in the Torah:

 
"Bre**** bara elohim et hashamaiym veet haaretz. Ve haarertz haita teho vavoe ve choshech al pnei tehom ve ruach elohim merachefet al pnei hamayim. Vayomer elohim yehi or vayihi or."
 

These are Hebrew words that Israelis are speaking in the streets and read in the newspapers.

I agree with you on that. Vayomer is like Vehu amar. Indeed there are couple of examples like that in the Tanach. But everyone who knows Hebrew knows that Vayomer is vehu amar. It's nothing new.

the example that you give is only 1% of the "difference". 99% are words that are spoken today and in the past.

What I meant by "fluently" is "with total ease". Reading Shakespeare is easy, but I wouldn't call it total ease. It is slightly harder than reading normal English. So I'd expect reading the Tanach to be the same sort of thing - perfectly possible without special training, but despite that just a slight challenge. Sorry if I'm repeating myself here.
 
 
Tell me something about Hebrew. Is there any capital letter in Hebrew?

Like in english, God means The God whereas god means a god - literally a false god. Also we start with capital letters for some nouns in English.

There is no capitalisation in languages like Bengali, Arabic,etc.

Nopeeeee.
 
 
so the words alone are sufficient to show respect or to emphasize something.

Makes sense.

Well, I suppose so. Never really thought about that but yeah Hebrew is a bit lax with punctuation and capitalisation really. I've many a time been like "what's that mean?" and it turns out it's someone's name.    
 
 
If Hebrew language has not changed, why is there the term "Modern hebrew"?
And what about Paleo-Hebrew (Before 585 B.C.)? There are differences between them.

On what basis are you saying that the original language of the Torah is the same as the Hebrew that all of Israel speak and referred to Modern Hebrew?

Makes me go back to the example of English of Shakespeare!

It has changed. Biblical Hebrew is different to Modern Hebrew. I'm fluent in neither but I know this is true.. I mean you can be fluent in Modern and understand Biblical, vice versa, but some verb tenses are the opposite way round and stuff.

The thing is that in Shakespearian the words are different, for example, "Art" is 'are' etc.

There are couple of words in the Tanach that of course they are in Hebrew but we almost don't use them in the nowadays talks, for example, the word for I (I am) is Ani/Anochi. Both of these two words are written in the Tanach in different sentences. When God ask Caine where his brother is then Caine answered: "Hashomer Achi [b]anochi[b/]?" Which means "Am I the keeper of my brother?" And in other sentence in the Tanach you can find this sentence in Genesis 15:7 when God says to Abraham: " Ani Adonai asher hoziaticha me ur kashdim", "I am God who took you out from Ur kashdim". 2 of them are pure Hebrew words, but usually we use the word Ani instead of Anochi although it's also possible to use the word 'Anochi'. Another example is 'Vayomer' which means 'Ve hu amar' which means 'and he said', nowadays you won't find someone in the streets who will tell you 'vayomer' but vayomer is pure Hebrew.

And the most important thing is that these examples are few ones cause 99.9% sentences in the Tanach are the same language and the same syntax that you can speak in the streets, as the first sentence from Genesis that I brought in my earlier post.

the word God is only an English word -- I don't think Jesus used the word "God" anytime in his life. It is not exclusive for Christians but perhaps for someone who understands nothing but English.

I used small 'g' for god to imply that god I am talking about is not divine by any manner. Just like Muslims do not capitalise 'h' as in His when they refer to Jesus or any other person in this regard.

A god may not be a false god to polytheists but it is for monotheists. Maybe I didn't clarify enough in my post.
 
 
To theists, I suspect the use of "God" is similar to the use of "City" to refer to London's financial district. There exist other gods (at least in concept) and certainly other cities, but the only one worth talking about is the one given the capital letter.

Possibly.

I wouldn't personally use anything that is ambiguous.
Instead of producing a list I think it is better to clarify the position of people of different faiths in complete sentences, such as:
Muslims refer God as Allah (Arabic) while English-speaking Christians refer God as God.

I see your point though. But it will be confusing for a novice person to understand what I mean if I simply produce a list of Gods/gods (!!!) for people of all faiths (including the God I believe in).
Essentially, all monotheistic religions believe in One God, but their perception of the God is very different relative to each other.
 
 
The reason is simply because due to the diaspora, hebrew was for many years only used for biblical study and the Jews would speak the language of their respective countries. Languages evolve over time, new words are added, if you where to compare English now to that of 200 years ago, it would be diffrent. Hebrew had not evolved over time due to the diaspora, so this eveloution had to take place in one go, some guy, i forget his name basicaly rewrote the language to make it compatable with the needs of a modern day language.

BTW i doubt you need to know hebrew to convert, most Jews out of Israel dont know hebrew, Gemma! haha Im near fluent at speaking though i am Israeli, i just moved here when i was young. I actualy struggle to read in hebrew, and a few weeks ago i found out that writen hebrew uses a diffrent alphabet to printed hebrew, i was shocked! When people ask is a language hard to learn, its really dependant on what languages you already know. I dont know whats harder in absolute terms out of English and Hebrew, its hard to say, but one thing is for sure, if you know English its much easier to learn a latin based language like french or german then it is to learn hebrew.
 
 
Yeah god is not a pet, with a name, its simply like dog is kelev in hebrew and kahlb in arabic so god is elohim in hebrew and allah in arabic.
 
 
Al-lah simply means "the God". It's no more a name than "Dieu" is the name for some deity worshipped solely by Francophones. I presume Arabic Bibles would use the exact same word in phrases such as "the God of Israel", or "of Jacob" or "of your fathers" or whatever.

His name was Eliezer Ben Yehuda, and he also added new words to the Hebrew language, words like Jacket, Telephone etc etc. Even today, new words are being added to the Hebrew language. For exmaple, the Hebrew word for @ (strudel ) is Kruchit, it was added only couple of months ago.

As far as im aware it is to do with the fact that self harming yourself is against the religion, ie causing yourself to bleed intentionaly. Well because in shaving, you are putting a blade up to your face, even if you cut yourself by mistake its taken as self harm since you are using a blade to cut yourself...

The  Bible  states in  Leviticus  19:27 that "Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard."  Talmudic   rabbis  understood this to mean that a man may not shave his beard with a  razor  with a single blade, since the cutting action of the blade against the skin "mars" the beard. Because  scissors  have two blades,  halakha  (rabbinic law) permits their use to trim the beard, as the cutting action comes from contact of the two blades and not the blade against the skin. For this reason, most  poskim  (Jewish legal decisors) rule that  Orthodox Jews  may use electric razors to remain cleanshaven, as such shavers cut by trapping the hair between the blades and the metal grating,  halakhically  a scissor-like action.

Many Ultra Orthodox Jews prefer to grow beards despite the allowance for electric shavers, for a variety of social and cultural reasons though.

From Wiki.

What Sunday school is?

And yes, I saw a movie in which Uri Geller was present at one of Reading games against Man U in January 1995 in a cup match and Uri broke a cup of the father of Eric Cantona and signed upon it. His father said: "C'est pa passible!"

Uri Geller, whattaguy.

I don't know if Geller is a Reading fan, but he's certainly an Exeter City fan. So much so in fact that he became chairman a few years ago. His wonderful powers seemed to fail him, though. Exeter were relegated from the football league the following season

I also remember him appearing on TV prior to the penalty shoot out between England and Portugal. He asked people to touch the screen and send “positive energy” to David Beckham. Sadly, however, Mr Beckham ballooned his pen over the bar. But, not to worry, Geller had an explanation for us. The reason for Beckham’s failure was because Geller had mistakenly sent “negative energy” to him by accident!

Check out James Randi exposing Geller on US TV. Try watching this without cringing:

steve_butters, I'd like to wish you long life (this is a wishing for talking about a thing that other man thought about before). Couple of minutes ago, before I logged into this forum, I read an  article  about the connection of Uri Geller to football in UK and all the tries of him (including a bizzar ceremony in Exeter stadium with Michael Jackson and David Blaine in 2002). If you want then I can translate it to you.

I saw the video of James Randi in google. Uri Geller is a magician. He has a TV serie in Israel, which the last episode of it was yesterday. In this serie he tested young people who can be his "successors".
 
 
I have a question for the the resident TSR Jews.

Why are the true torah Jews so heavily discriminated against by maninstream Jews, especially in the west??

At the end of the day they are only following their intrepretation of the Jewish faith, yet they are villfied for doing so.

That isnt a 'sect' or anything, its simply they name themselves this, saying they dont belive in a state of Israel, infact its not quite like this, they do want a country but in the bible it says God will create it, and yet Israel was created by people, so they are not happy with it. They are disliked for the obvious reason that they are against Israel. Zionism is not a religious movement, if it was then Israel would be a religiously governed state, but it is not, and school students can even choose in school wether they want to study judaisam, christiany or islam in religious education classes. Zionism is about geting Jews out of diaspora, a country where they can live together, just like there are many countries where muslims or christians live in majority.

Like i was saying they are disliked for being against Israel, how ever they are tolerated, there was only anything done about those 5 Jews from an extreme group that went to the iran holocaust denial. They where banned from synagogues, banned form Israel (the 5 where all american or british) and they have been harased a lot but this was just the reaction of people on the street.

They are pretty much the same, all these things are not diffrent religious sects, in terms of religion they are the same, orthadox Jews. These things are closer to a political movement then anything else.
 
 
Do you find the word "yid" offensive?

So similar but not actually another name for the same thing, then.

 
Do you find the word "yid" offensive?
 

Building on that, I've had it explained once before but I still don't quite understand - assuming "yid" is offensive (which I believe it is, or at least can be), why is the term "Yiddish" not found offensive by anyone ?
 
 
Presumably it's on the same lines as "Paki" and "Pakistani"?
 
 
Yid in itself isn't offensive; however, the contect in which/useageof it by certain people give it a derogatory attachment.
It's similar to '******' - commonly used by black people amongst themselves but in the past has been used by certain people in a derogatory contxt.

All I can say is:  

They're not 'true torah Jews.' They're Jews against Zionism. Otherwise known as the Neutrei Karta. They're a small minority (thankfully). I think it's pretty obvious why most Jews condemn them actually, when they go to Holocaust denial conferences in Iran, call for the abolition of Israel - the land Jews believe is their homeland, etc etc. Their 'interpretation' is wrong, quite simply. That might sound extreme but their 'interpretation' contradicts just about everything else in the Torah and normally one wouldn't mind if they hold those beliefs. But when they start brainwashing the world that their beliefs are mainstream beliefs, when they try and destroy the land most of the world's Jews live in and when they mix with enemies, then we have a problem.

And that's all I have to say on the matter.

Next please.

Well, you know how for example football groups have 'official suporters groups' or what ever they are called, well imagine a football team having 2 of these groups, they are exactly the same, they just happened to join a diffrent suporters group.

There are diffrent sects of Jews, their beliefs are the same, its just a question of how closely they follow the torah. The vast majority of every group are for Israel, but of the most religious, the orthadox jews, a small minority of them are against Israel because the old testament says God will create the nation of Israel and they see this is medaling with Gods work by creating their own state. So these Jews, to voice their protest, join groups, which like i said before are not religious sects since it does not split them religiously, well they join these groups to protest, i guess the only diffrence between the groups is the legnths that they go to to protest.
 
 
You believe that 'uzayr is son of God, right? The man in the following event shown by this verse is called 'uzayr in Arabic:

 
Or (bethink thee of) the like of him who, passing by a township which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its death ? And Allah made him die a hundred years, then brought him back to life. He said: How long hast thou tarried ? (The man) said: I have tarried a day or part of a day. (He) said: Nay, but thou hast tarried for a hundred years. Just look at thy food and drink which have not rotted! Look at thine ass! And, that We may make thee a token unto mankind, look at the bones, how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh! And when (the matter) became clear unto him, he said: I know now that Allah is Able to do all things.
 

Qur'an [2:59]
I'm just showing you the story of 'uzayr so that if he has another name in Judaism then you can identify him by this event in the verse.

So you say he's son of God, right?

Edit: So in the Torah it says that the Jews have a "promised land"?
 
 
And there was me thinking the Israelites were known as the Children of God?

So if a Jew does marry a non-Jew, it is a sin.

If you want to get rid of this sin, do you just repent or divorce your partner?
I think there is a separate British law for Jews regarding marriage/divorce issue (could you clarify me on this?).
Cheers.  

Oh this whole marriage question popped up after I looked at Agent Smith's signature where he says you are his vritual TSR wife.

There are sins in Judaism too. So if there is no act of repentance,then what are the consequences of committing sins? How can someone "purify" himself from such sins?

Now there is another question. Is there any concept of Judgement Day, Heaven and Hell in Judaism?

Woah, yes there is. Repentence plays a very big part in Judaism not only during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur but everyday. The Amida prayer which is said thrice daily contains a paragraph on repentence.

Tbh, we don't really refer to transgressions as "sins" as such. If a Jew transgresses, he repents. I don't think it's so simple with marriage. If you marry a non-Jew and repent it's not going to work, it would require divorce and repentence since the Jewish view of repentence is firstly, admitting to your transgression, secondly, vowing never to commit it again and thirdly, to put what you did right.

And yep. When Jews marry they sign a Ketuba which is a Jewish marriage contract.

I'm kind of a bit of a newbie when it comes to the D&D Subforum, but this caught my eye and I decided that I should jump in. In the spirit of disclosure, I can tell you guys that I went to a Jewish School for nine years, but I'm in no way an expert on anything... at all.

Do Jews have a concept of the afterlife? Not so much. It's referred to in different ways in the Bible as "Sheol" (Especially when Jacob says that if Benjamin dies, it will "send his head down to Sheol in grief"), but there is nothing explicitly stating what will happen when you're dead. What is know is that when the Mashiach (the messiah) come, he will resurrect everyone and rebuild the temple. Otherwise, there's no explicit Heaven, Hell and Judgement such as there is in Christianity and (from my understanding) Islam.

I could of sworn I read that somewhere here.

This is an interesting idea, similar to the idea that I've heard about Hinduism that everyone is a Hindu even if they're not. To my knowledge, I think that the Ten Commandments are supposed to be abided by all, since the whole Earth was quiet when they were given. The laws in the Torah are for Jews only. However, there is an converse idea that you can't ever renounce your Judaisim. You can stop practicing, but until you die, you're always a Jew.

The same "I'm not an expert" caveat applies.
 
 
Arent Jewish women meant to cover their hair??
 
 
What defines somebody as being jewish?
 
 
That can't be right, because converts don't necessarily have Jewish mothers.
 
 
Basically, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. However, its religion, it barely ever makes sense. 'Just accept it and shut up' I think is the mantra.

As far as I know as a non-Jew, it's because it isn't kosher. And what is and isn't kosher is written down in a Jewish holy book.

Sociologically, it probably has to do with the leaders of the tribe passing on lore that would be useful for people to survive in a time when there were less hygenic food preperation facilities than now. A lot of what is and isn't kosher is how to kill the animal, what not to cook together, etc.

The rules for all "beasts of the land", as per Vayikra/Leviticus are the following:

1) The animal has to chew its cud.
2) The animal has to have split hooves.

A big fits criterion #2, but not number one. I don't really understand gets the horrible rep, but I think it has something to do with all of their neighbors commonly eating pig (as opposed to, say, lion), and Jewish not.

For the same reason that they do not eat ham or bacon, or indeed other non-Kosher animals; that is, they either do not chew the cud or have split hooves. I think pigs have split hooves but don't chew the cud. So they're not kosher. And no it's not an issue of cleanliness.

So if there is no concept of Hell, what do you think the fate of a person like Hitler will be? I guess you will say he will be disassociated with God once he dies - that is the end of him. But then again, does that recompense the evil he committed? We will all die, so for example how does my death differ from Hitler's?
 
 
So for a Jew who spent a miserable life, what will be his reward?
I am saying since Judaism does not pay much attention to afterlife, then this life is the one that a person has to live fullest right? So what reward can that person expect if this life is nothing but tragedies,sufferings,etc?

it's a good point. If they didn't believe in an afterlife, how did Jews in concentration camps or suffering pogroms reconcile their faith with their desperate situation? I expect there is an answer...
 
 
Fair enough. But there are many unfortunates who are victims of tragedies, suffereings (as was in World War 2). I did not mean intentionally, more so due to fate. They had nothing good in their lives.

Then again there are Mafia's who are involved in crimes all their lives and they never get caught (they just live happily and die).
What news does God have (referring from Torah and Talmud) for them?

I don't think Judaism requires you to disbelieve in afterlife. It's just that there is not much information about it from Torah. That is why Judaism does not put much emphasis on afterlife. (Correct me if I am wrong.)

 
Traditional Judaism firmly believes that death is not the end of human existence. However, because Judaism is primarily focused on life here and now rather than on the afterlife, Judaism does not have much dogma about the afterlife, and leaves a great deal of room for personal opinion. It is possible for an Orthodox Jew to believe that the souls of the righteous dead go to a place similar to the Christian heaven, or that they are reincarnated through many lifetimes, or that they simply wait until the coming of the messiah, when they will be resurrected. Likewise, Orthodox Jews can believe that the souls of the wicked are tormented by demons of their own creation, or that wicked souls are simply destroyed at death, ceasing to exist.

wow, are you religious?

There is a vast amount of literature referring to the afterlife (olam habah/ gan eden whatever), and its fairly explicit that a jewish soul is immortal and will not die. There is a maximum time for purgatory, and a definite timetable for acsension

The afterlife is one of the essential beliefs for a jew to have faith or emunah according to primary rabbinic sources.
 
 
Well Justin, maybe its because you should be able to leed a good honest life with out needing the promise of reward for it. A lot of religions seem to base acting decent not commiting sins on the reward after you die, but you dont see athiests going around thinking, well when oyu die you die and thats it so lets go and cause trouble and live a dishonrable life.
 
 
About the afterlife thing, as people have said there's more of an emphasis on the life which we are currently in within Judaism. Some Rabbi (can't remember who) said something along the lines of...
'Who are we to understand death, we who cannot understand life?"
...which sums it up quite nicely. But yeah, there are plenty of references to some kind of afterlife, like in Daniel about the valley of dry bones and all that.
Frankly I think it's a good thing for a religion not to get excessivly hung up on the afterlife. As my (highly cynical) RS teacher pointed out, you never know if religious people (of some religions) are being nice "for duty's sake", as it were, or because they'll get a better deal in the afterlife. As far as I can see, G-d's shown us how to live, and if we can sort that one out, we'll get what we deserve afterwards, not only that but we'll have a fulfilled mortal life.
The holocaust thing...yeah, there were a good few Jews who lost their faith because of it. Others say it was a punishment from G-d. Other still see it as a sort of positive thing - it had a major impact on the creation of the State of Israel, it resulted in greater understanding of religious relations, the fact that Jews got through it and came out better than ever shows how G-d is still sorting things out, and so on. No-one knows why G-d acts how He does, if we did then it would sort of defeat the whole deal of Him being G-d at all.

I quite rarely agree with you, but on this point, right on!
 
 
CBA looking through all the posts but there seems to be some confusion in this and since I wrote a 3,000 word essay (grumble grumble) on afterlife I'll try and clear a few things up.

The Jewish 'hell' isn't the hell most people associate with hell. Wow I really am good with my words this morning. I'll try again, the usual connotations of hell are not what Judaism prescribes 'hell' as. It's about spiritual repair, not fire, torture and brimstone. In the written Torah, there is hardly any reference to afterlife at all. And there's quite a simple reason for this; Judaism wants us to focus in this life and adhere to commandments and the Torah for the good of this world and because it's our Divine privilege to do so, not so it gets us up to heaven. Ergo, the rewards in the next world should not be a pertinent factor in influencing one's behaviour in this world.

There are a few subtle references in the written Torah such as when Biblical characters die (such as Avraham, Issac, etc) they are said to be "gathered unto his people." There are a few other references I can't be bothered going into but take my word for it.

The oral Torah elaborates a bit more on the afterlife and makes some comparisons about this world being a preparation for the next and how certain sins remove a person's share in the world to come.

Very wicked people will not get a share in the world to come. Righteous people will. It's quite complex and there's varying opinions as to what happens in the world to come and how each person gets there so if you want to know anymore then I'd advise doing your own research. Jewfaq is good, as is Wiki and a few other random sites on google.

It's a rule that really doesn't seem to make any sense. It's like the whole Natural Witch and one is born a witch thing in the world of Paganism and alt. religions. It makes no sense, and the idea of a natural witch has lost all credibility. The point is about religion and religion is not passed down through genes. Well thats what alt. religions believe. I think most have come to accept that religion is more or less a conscious choice for one reason or another.

If it's going to be linked to ethnicity, to make it clearer it shouldnt be directly related to religion. It just confuzzles everything.

yes and wine is part of practicing the religion, like on the Friday night kiddush, and in the pesach seder it really is an integral part, and all the little kids get grape juice instead lol Once your parents finally decided that you can have wine, you taste it and you hate it but you keep on drinking because you dont want to drink that lovely sweet grape juice like those little kids!

Its way beyond the scope this discussion to start talking about the various stages after death etc. There is solid conclusion and agreement on most of it.

By "primary rabbinic sources" I meant the mishnah and gemorah. It's explicit there, and as far as I'm aware, undisputed.

I got the impression that even if a woman wasn't a Jew, then she'd pass it on to her kids, if they didn't know either, they'd (if they was female) would pass it on to their kids too?

Of course. It's even encouraged during some holidays.

Are you saying there is agreement on exactly what form the afterlife takes? Furthermore, how often is the afterlife mentioned in the Torah?

It's silly to try to separate the Jewish religion from the Jewish culture; the former is an integral part of the latter.

 

A culture automatically means an ethnicity? And it's silly to say that someone is a Jew linked to (and based on) Jewish religion and culture because their mother was a Jew. The adoption of religion and culture should be conscious decisions otherwise, it's arbitary.

That's because it's the country they live in. Someone who is brought up by Muslims/Buddhist/other non-Christian religons does not have to be socialised into their respective cultures. One tends to be socialised into British culture or French culture or Spanish culture on the basis of integration. A ''Jew'' may be socialised in British culture and never be part of Jewish culture. And isnt their a link between how religious someone is and how much they will take part in the culture? (a bit of spin off of the religon)

Why would someone born of a Jewish mother necessarily care about Jewish culture and then socialise their children into Jewish culture?
 
 
Evil-Tuna, maybe you should be asking a different question, specifically why someone born of a Jewish mother would necessarily care anymore about Jewish culture/religion than someone born of a Jewish father   Or even someone (hypothetically) brought up Jewish but without Jewish parentage (like adopted people). Or a Jewish person brought up in a secular household.

Maybe you're getting mixed up with after the wedding. The bride doesn't wear a wig at her wedding but once married, Jewish women are required to cover their hair. This can be done by a hat, scarf or wig. It's to preserve her hair for her husband's eyes only.

"Since"? Don't know about that. Turn of the twentieth century, perhaps. But until about 1948, when suddenly they had good reason to be nationalists simultaneously with the Left switching its allegiance to the Palestinians.

It's true. Which is why Israel doesn't stamp passports.

Also, you could've tried Wiki - it is your friend  

EDIT: I doubt they'd arrest you, and they can hardly kick you out if they haven't let you in.

No, it's a well-known fact that a number of Arab countries won't let you in if you've been to Israel. This comes from the fact that they don't recognise it, amongst other things.

They do stamp passports. You can request them not to, though.

I remember a few months ago a friend of mine had trouble getting into Israel because she had been to Lebanon recently, and because of that had a 4 hour wait at the airport.

Oh, right. I'd only read the Wiki article on the subject... Although I guess, if your passport is Israeli already, it doesn't really matter whether they stamp it or not (although I don't know if yours is...).

I have a British (Goodness, there's no pleasing some people) passport. I'm not Israeli. But everytime I've gone to Israel I've had a stamp on my passport so as you can imagine, the Arab countries would love me.

Yes, there's more questioning (heck, everyone gets questioned anyway)but they don't stop people altogether and they certainly don't get into trouble. It's for security reasons, that's all.
 
 
"Trouble getting in", not "getting in trouble". Difference  
 
 
4 hours waiting at the airport is still trouble, is it not?  

Edit: Heh, this '  trouble  ' is not only with non-Israelis, but Arab-Israeli citizens, too.  

and  this .

Awwww dammit, I wanted a cool stamp   How abouts if i got a visa to Jordan from Israel...and based myself in Jerusalem and went into Jordan for as many days as I wanted, but like loads of day trips...

I'm really not sure if you can cross directly from Jordan to Israel. And anyway, you'd still have to show your passport. The middle easy ain't in Schengen!

Yes it's absolutely fine. The only trouble would be with an israeli stamp if you wanted to visit another arab country (not jordan or egypt)

Border control wont stamp your passport on exit anyway if its an Israeli one. If it's british, dont worry about it. Passage between Jordan and Israel is absolutely fine, although watch out if you take the Eilat crossing into Aqaba due to the number of plaestinians there.

You don't need to get a visa to visit Jordan on an Israeli passport. PM if you need to know more about border control etc there.

alasdair_R: yes you can.

Depends. Most Jews see Jesus as a good man, but not the son of God. There are however Messanic Jews who do believe that he is the son of God, but also see the importance of sticking to the 613 rules of the Torah as well. In my experience Messanic Jews tend to be fairly nutty people.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

That's most possibly for the Ask a Christian thread, though I may be wrong but it's probably in the New Testament. It's not in the Bible or Old Testament anyway, no.

Prophet? So why don't you follow any of his teachings?
 
 
they do not follow in Jesus's teaching because they believe there is going to be a final messiah....hence in muslims eyes the final messiah is the false messiah i.e the dajjal..
 
 
It would be interesting to know what Jews think of a Prophet.

He's not in our Torah. I mean we recognise or accept that he was a prophet but we don't follow anything because we don't follow the New Testament.
 
 
I know he is not in Torah. Even though there are debates as to what Torah says regarding Messiah and how Christ fulfills that.

But as a Jew, what do you feel is fundamentally wrong with the NT that contradicts Torah apart from the obvious trinitarian theology?
 
 
Another interesting point that I came across in the Christian thread was this:

So children of Israel, what are your views with regards to God suffering from pain?

Luke 22:70.

They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You are right in saying I am."

that is more appropriate in "Ask a Christian" thread. And people like Nathan have responded that question many times I am afraid. Apparently, there are many passages in NT where Jesus PBUH has been quoted as saying such and interpreted by Christian theologians accordingly.

lol if that is how you feel, then do not even bother asking this question in this thread because obviously Judaism has no answer or support for that.  
 
 
Last Rabbi I heard talking to a priest about Jesus...conversation started like this...
Priest: So what exactly do you believe about Jesus?
Rabbi: He was a heretic.
 
Handy article here which explains well in basic terms why Jews "don't believe" in Jesus.
 http://www.aish.com/spirituality/phi..._In_Jesus$.asp 
And I believe the commonly accepted translation of Jesus' reply when being asked if he was G-d's son was "You say that I am" rather than "You are right to say that I am". Would be interested to hear any other views on the translation, as it's a pretty important fine translation point!
Anyway, I hardly think that just claiming to be Messiah qualifies you to be him. Unfortunately for some.

There are no debates about Christ in the Torah.

Apart from it contradicting just about everything in the Torah (such as Shabbat, etc), and apart from it not being our Holy Book but the Christians' Holy Book then nothing.   It's like me asking a Hindu why they think the Koran is 'wrong'.

Haha, no. I think it was a rabbi actually. Meh, it doesn't make any difference. Either way, we believe he existed but there isn't really much more to it.
 
 
What do modern-day Jews think of the alleged crucifiction of Christ by the Jews? Do you condemn the action of the Jews at that time or support it on the ground of Christ being a liar and his blasphemous sayings?

Or do you not believe in the incident at all?
Please support your answer with reference from Rabbis/Tanakh/reliable Jewish sources. Thanks.

Anyway, my question was on the basis of similarity between Christianity and Judaism. Christians do not believe Torah is wrong, but that God has made a new covenant with the people after the appearance of Christ.

Surely that's like asking 'What do modern-day Christians think of the execution of [insert name of executed person here]?'...

Sounds like a bloody GCSE RS essay question if I ever saw one!

It's not like there's a general belief amongst all Jews about the crucifiction. It's not something I've really pondered over and Jews, as a whole, don't. It's not our religion so why should we say what we think of it?

I don't see how I can use the Tanakh to backup anything I say since Jesus isn't mentioned in the Tanakh or any Jewish source whatsoever.

I don't see what the big deal is. It's not my religion to comment on.

You get the idea.

Ok, so Jews believe the Torah is right. Full stop. Anything after or other than the Torah such as the New Testament we do not believe in. That doesn't mean it's wrong but it's just not ours.
 
 
It's actually a relatively easy matter to exclude religious matters from a discussion of the Crucifixion, if one wants to. For instance, one could perfectly well argue that it wasn't the Jews of Jerusalem who were responsible, it was the Romans. And the crowd chanting "crucify!" were not doing so because they were familiar with the prophecies and had concluded that Jesus was a heretic, but merely because they had been whipped into an unthinking frenzy by a few priests with a personal vendetta.
 
 
Or it was just an aftermarket addition by gospel writers 'marketing' to the Romans, and thus would prefer to cast the roman authority as a reluctant executioner, and blame the jews instead.

P.S. Oh, there is one mention of Christ in a Jewish source - Josephus, as I recall. However, it was forged in, and whilst it is thought there was originally something there, we don't know what, so...

The matter of cruicifiction can be looked upon both from a religious perspective and moral perspective.
I know Jesus PBUH is not part of your religion but when there are allegations of people of your faith being involved, there should be some formal/informal statements. When there were suicide bombings in London done by some Muslims, others had to comment on it.

What is the punishment for blashphemy in Judaism? If there is nothing stated about punishment, so I take it that you agree on the statement that whoever did it to Jesus PBUH was morally and religiously wrong. Unless ofcourse you do not believe that actually happened.

But they thought they'd keep in all the stuff about judgement against rulers, about Jesus being the only true King, about the Resurrection nullifying the Roman act of persecution, and the politically subversive miracles (such as the exorcism of many demons, called 'Legion', into pigs, despised animals, that later are obliterated)? That and the fact that the trial scene can quite capably be interpreted as at least somewhat 'sarcastic' - look what Pilate manages to do, trick the Jews into admitting guilt, simultaneously forcing them to attribute a rebellious heart to their kin and proclaim no other King but Caesar.

I am open to what you're saying, Greg, don't get me wrong, but it just doesn't sound likely from what is included in the Gospels, and from what could be said of the trial scene itself.

Yeah, but the Muslims bombed London 18 months ago, whereas Jews killed Jesus 2000 years ago. If we're going down that route, I'd like everyone who voted for Hitler to apologise personally to me for contributing to the murder of my family   And everyone who had relatives who were involved in the Crusades, likewise.
You're also forgetting that since Jesus was a Jew and so were most of his original followers, you should be grateful that there were enough Jewish blasphemers around then to help your religion find their prophet (Jesus that is).

Seriously, it's pathetic to expect personal apologies from Jews for something done within their own religion 2000 years ago.

As Gems said, Jesus shouldn't really be discussed here as he's about as relevant as a snail.

I apologise for the injustice and cruelty done to your family though I have no connection whatsoever.

I do not think any rational Christian is proud of the Crusade or Holocaust. Same with the Muslims when a Muslim bomb innocent people in this land.
Therefore I condemn all these actions. And surely God is All-Just to recompense the culprits accordingly.

Just wanted to know if you have the same attitude with regards to the alleged death of Christ on the cross. No apology required or needed.
Cheers anyway.  
 
 
I was arguing this in the pub the other night. Days before the whole Barrabas/Jesus debacle occurred, the Jews welcomed Jesus with open arms, they didn't know what they wanted. I think if anyone's to blame it'd be the Jewish leaders; they whipped their followers up against Jesus because they were scared by him and by him stealing their power. The Jews and Romans are not to blame.

I mentioned apology not needed or required. I also mentioned that there is an allegation that Jews did it. Who did it is a debatable topic and whether Christ was actually crucified is also debatable.

Condemnation of the act itself is what I wanted to know. Not necessrily from a religious perspective.
 
 
How is a bunch of romans hanging a random bloke relevant to this discussion?

It's not debateable by anybody who's actually opened a history book before. The romans crucified jesus, not the jews. This is fact, and it is undisputed.

because the argument is over who's to blame, and seeing as Jews are often put forward as being to blame, and this thread is about Jews I'd say it's related.

ps. they didn't hang him.

I really don't see why there should be 'Jewish Condemnation' of the execution of Jesus.

If there should, then why shouldn't there be Muslim condemnation of the death of, say  Sadiq 'Abd al-Karim Mal Allah  ?

Or should Christians condemn the execution of Timothy McVeigh?

Hell, We're attempting to assign indirect blame for an act 2000 years ago? This is a topic for historians who have studied the period in depth, and are capable of considering the factors from a academic perspective. Nobody here is qualified or wanting to do that.

I mean, its pretty much analogous to "were the jews to blame for 9/11"....except its 2000 years prior to that and none of us were even alive!

ps. crucified then u lil ginger pedant! who cares

My word, can we get onto actual Jewish questions here rather than what Jews think of another religion.
 
 
Here's a video:
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpo6pGAy1GI&eurl= 

And here's a quote:
 
Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor,with cooperation from some Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, killed Jesus.
 

 http://www.americancatholic.org/News...SFS/an0399.asp 

I did not say Jews killed Jesus. But there are allegations and there were Jews who helped then and who still support the whole act. End of chapter.
Do you fall into this group or condemn them and disassociate yourself from them? But I guess I got enough responses by now!!
 
 
Pontius Pilate didn't kill Jesus.

I fall into neither because it does not affect me and I do not have any strong beliefs/concerns regarding the matter. What a few Jews here and there did or did not do 2000 years ago, to be honest, does not really take over most of the day's thoughts.

Lol hilarious. Hardly a date though is it?  

What?! You have an ex wife?   Ok ok, let's get this straight. What's her name?
 
 
Are you sure 'what's your ex-wife's name?' is really a question that falls under the remit of 'Ask a Jew'?

Is there a Jewish polygamous sect? Maybe they're both his ex-wife!

No, unless possibly their mothers did so too. Or have I still not properly understood the definition of "Jew"?
 
 
But "another religion" doesn't include atheism, isn't that it? So you can get atheist Jews, but not Christian Jews etc?
 
 
Isn't lack of faith a betrayal in itself? Doesn't the covenant that Jews have with God require them, at a fairly basic level, to believe in Him?
 
 
what about if they was forced to convert?

Forced ? In what circumstances? Technically, a convert cannot be forced because it is such a long and committed process that it is impossible to enter it unless you WANT to yourself. The Rabbis simply won't allow it if there is a lack of willingness.
 
 
Hey, i was watching this Christian versus Islam debate, where they were talking about Muhammad (pbuh) in the bible and the Muslim said "Although i believe Jesus was the Messiah he isnt propheziced by name in the Torah nor is he the heir to David - but that is another debate"

So my question is - how can there be a debate if Jesus doesnt fulfil the prophecy in that respect? Kind of looking for 2 sides of the argument here

Regards, Asad

Correct.

Correct.

I suggest you go ask a Christian instead of a Jew. As they believe that Jesus was the Messiah I'm sure they'll be happy to provide you with an answer.

no, forced to convert from Judaism to another religion.
 
 
Just a question, how do you feel about the other "ask a insert religious person" threads out numbering your threads, with the atheists not far behind?

Do people just not have as many questions for Judaism or is it that people love hurling loaded questions at muslims?

Should we be feeling anything in particular?
 
 
Unrestrained hatred?  

If you want to find out about how and why Jesus is believed to fulfil the Torahic prophecies, you would do well start by asking someone who actually believes He did so at all; pop into "Ask A Christian".

For starters, the Ask a Muslim thread is way older than this one. And why would we have any feelings towards such an irrelevant matter? Oy vey.
 
 
Hi,

I've a quick question. If my father was jewish and my mother was muslim, could I still be jewish? As my mother isn't jewish, which is a requirement for being jewish (i think!) could I still practice judaism.

Cheers!

Technically no. You're only Jewish if your mother is regardless of what your father is. There's nothing to stop you practicing Judaism (it's a good way of life!   ) but if you wanted to make it "count" then one would have to convert.
 
 
Wouldn't a Jewish father ask his wife-to-be to convert? Or is that assuming a family in which religion is not practised but the child decides to take up judaism (where if they had a lapsed Jewish mother, they would not need to convert)

It often is the case, yeah. But she'll only convert if she wants to... and it happens, a lot of the time, where the non-Jewish wife-to-be is more into Judaism than the Jewish husband and then she converts and is all religious and then he becomes religious and then they're one religious happy Jewish family.

Well that's why I put the word "count" in speech marks. I was a bit reluctant to use it. And you're right, but I mean, it's just human nature to want to be properly Jewish if you're going to practice it, otherwise people wouldn't bother converting.
 
 
Rightio.

Paganism was the major religion back then wiseguy. Pagan is also a proper noun and so in ''God'' in any sense. Unless, you're deliberately trying to be derogatory about a legitimate religon.

I recall reading somewhere that the Jewish God was referred to as the "main God" originally, and that this was only changed to the "only God" when Jews stopped following all old pagan traditions.

 

That's not true at all. Pagans can be devoted to a particular deity, that's why there were the cult of Brigid, cults of Bastet etc. You could mean devoted to a particular deity in general. In which case, yes that could be a reason for lack of dogma.

It did not require dedication? What rituals do you think Pagans performed to their Gods and for the seasonal festivals? And some Pagans were converted by changing Goddesses in Saints. Like Saint Brighid and so on. That's in Christianity obviously. But the sway wasn't because of lack of dedication, it's more like because of lack of dogma. Paganism today doesn't claim to know of any true path, but just one path to the Gods etc.

And why did the Jews feel the need to convert the Pagans. What you've said seems to say that. Is that not the case? If it is, I thought they didn't try to convert?

And can't you use capitalisation?

EDIT: Read my post in ask a d+d mod if you wonder why I wont reply to whatever else you may spout.

 
 
 
Bis, if you're bracketing polytheism only an inch above atheism in terms of devotion to the deity, I advise you to think long and hard about Hinduism. If what you say were true, there would be no polytheists left today.
 
 
Looks like I need to take a long hard look at it myself, then. I don't know how many converts Hinduism gets these days...   I take it it's not masses?

Both of which have a fair degree of evangelism involved.
 
 
Question:

I heard the Torah strictly forbids the premise of a Jewish state. Is this true ?
 
 
Why do the Neturei Karta claim otherwise, that it does go against Judaism ?
 
 
What are these preconditions ?

And they claim that Jews should spread out instead of being concentrated in one place.
 
 
Fair enough. Any other takers ?
 
 
The establishment of Israel does seem odd in that respect, given what happened less than five years prior to it - I'm surprised there wasn't a Diaspora-wide anxiety about eggs and baskets. At least non-European Jews survived the Holocaust; didn't anyone fear that, by founding a homeland, they'd just be offering global anti-Semites one convenient target in the place of many, and saving them a lot of bother? Obviously it's not as simple as that, because there are still plenty of Jews not in Israel, but even so... I'm pretty sure that some anti-Semite figures (notably Hassan Nasrallah, I think) have expressed a kind of warped gratitude to the Jews for concentrating themselves in one place for ease of, well, being attacked.
 
 
True, I suppose. Certainly the "eggs-in-one-basket" objection does lose a little of its strength when the basket is able (by virtue of containing so many eggs) to maintain its own army.

The NK claim that Jews can only have a Jewish State once the Messiah comes because that's when the temple is supposed to be rebuilt and the resurrection of the dead, etc, occurs. Most other Jews, however, believe that it is possible and that we should have a State now, and because we have won all the wars (especially the Yom Kippur war which we very nearly lost) G-d must be wanting us to have the State.

Also, I think there should be a distinction made between a Jewish State and a State for the Je ws. The former would mean that the complete country is governed by Jewish Law (Halacha) whilst the latter means that any Jew can go and live there whenever they want - a haven for the Jews, if you will. Whilst today's Israel is a mixture of both, the latter seems to be most prominent because nobody in Israel is forced to keep Shabbat or eat kosher food only, etc. It is a secular state. A democracy, not a theocracy. Israel does have components of being a Jewish State as Jewish festivals are observed as national holidays, e.g. Yom Kippur is the equivalent of a bank holiday here. The former would never be completely achieved until the Messiah does come, and so I may be wrong, but where the Torah apparently forbids a Jewish State before the Messiah comes, that doesn't mean Jews can not have a State in which they can live in. That's the way I see it anyhow.

Where exactly does the Torah stand on this ?

No offence but I can't take that seriously. That is as weak as Bush telling us God told him to invade Iraq.

I see. What I got from the NK was that because today's Israel has some religiousness to it, it shouldn't exist. Thanks anyway

Carefull there with what you say, Israel faced huge loses Yom Kippur war yet only 20% of what the arabs lost, and indeed Egypt and Syria did gain an initial footing in the first 2 days due to the suprise attack and much to do with the Bar Lev line not bieng armed as strongly as it should have been but whilst it certainly shook Israel, they where never near defeat and with in a week the IDF where marching on Damascas and Cairo, forced to stop by the threat of Soviet intevention which had already supplied the arabs with 1200 t-61 tanks and 300 mig 21 fighter jets, the former being used by Syria in what was the 2nd biggest tank battle in military history (the only think bigger was the battle of kursc during ww2) Infact the only time Israel ever really faced defeat was in the first few weeks of the war of independence. Where the 1 day old state with about 600,000 people was attacked by Egypt, Iraq, Saudia Arabia, Lebbanon, Syria and Jordan.

Numerous sources in the Torah promise the Jewish people a land of Israel and Avraham is told to go and sojourn there. I don't really know where it says we can't have a Jewish State until the Messiah comes (supposing it really does say that, and if it does I don't think it's so clear cut.. hey, if the Torah explicitly said this then why the hell are there thousands of other Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox Jews supporting Israel, travelling there and living there. The way I see it, the Neutrei Karta don't like Israel because it's too secular. I don't understand them anyway. It's not like we're rebuilding the temple or resurrecting the dead ourselves somehow. Meh, they're a tiny, ignorant, back-stabbing minority and I don't see why I should try and explain why their illogical ramblings are contradictory; you should be asking them why they're deviating from mainsteam Judaism and not vice versa.

 
No offence but I can't take that seriously. That is as weak as Bush telling us God told him to invade Iraq.
 

Whatever - you're asking me a religious question so you're going to get a religious answer.

 
I see. What I got from the NK was that because today's Israel has some religiousness to it, it shouldn't exist. Thanks anyway  
 

Which is basically what I said, though there is very little religiousness to Israel as a whole.

Where the 1 day old state with about 600,000 people was attacked by Egypt, Iraq, Saudia Arabia, Lebbanon, Syria and Jordan.

 

Look, I realise that Israel faced huge tragic losses and it was the hardest war Israel has ever faced which is why I said they nearly lost. But the fact that they won despite all this means Israel still stands today and if you're going to look at this from a religious point of view which is what this is all about then surely you'll believe that G-d wanted Israel to win the war and thus for it to be established.

Why the location then? Isn't a secular Israel incongruent with that?
 
 
There's no reason why a secular state should consciously avoid holy ground, if that's what you mean. But the background to the foundation of Israel is a patchwork of the religious and the secular, with these two groups each trying to pull Zionism in their own direction. The location of Israel is one of the battles that was won by the religious side of the movement, in managing to effectively veto the alternatives. Although I'm not entirely sure how they did this.

I thought Zionism was supposed to be a predominately secular/atheistic movement?
 
 
Was it? Perhaps officially. But it was inevitable that it would draw support from religious quarters as well - the Neturei Karta are the exception rather than the rule in that respect, as I'm sure you already know.

Drawing support is quite different to having a very strong element bargaining for a position and a say on a certain matter etc. Especially an extremely important matter. It just seems like a very strange shift, if that's what it was, or that is what you're saying.

I think it was always going to gather support after certain historic events from quite a few quarters.

Ya ok. You're mixing political Zionism (secular) with the Biblical teachings of the land of Israel. Politcal Zionism and indeed the founding of Israel was secular (and Israel today still is very secular - just take a trip to Tel Aviv) with Western ideas & concepts, Western clothes etc. As I said, Israel is not a theocracy. Political Zionism came about out of a need for a safe haven for Jews from the anti-Semitism and that is indeed what caused Herzl to look for a Jewish state (with his other idea of all Jews converting to Christianity not proving feasible). Now, as you know, Uganda was originally offered. So why was Israel chosen? This indeed does seem to infer that Israel in some way is religious and it's true... though Jews in Israel itself are not religious (most are traditional and modern) they value the Biblical references to Israel as the Holy and Promised Land, in the Torah. So whilst Israel's foundings are entirely secular, the land itself has a connection to religious ideologies. After all, it's only logical to locate the land with some Jewish connection.

Well, maybe that's when the religious influences started to wield sufficient clout to determine the location, then.

I dont think the founding can be called truly secular in any real meaningful sense of the word. The religious significance of the land is the whole reason for the location, and that is inherently linked to the founding. What could be said is Israel is secular now and this leads to... tbh, would it/should it really care if the Palestinians have less of a supposed less of a religious tie to Jerusalem than any Jewish significance there? (that raises questions over the creation of a Palestinian state and the religious significance for them)

What was wrong with the Uganda offer apart from the fact that it wasn't that bit of land with religious significance?

Well no, not truly secular because the founding is in the land linked to the Torah but it depends how you look at it. Its founders were completely secular, they did it for secular reasons and it still is a secular state. As I said, the original plan was Uganda and I think Herzl was ready to accept that until others including the British thought it was sensible to use a land with religious significance too, i.e. Israel.

About the Palestinians - no. They don't need a religious tie to it to also have a state. I'm not going to start debating about their history but the Palestinians are simply Arab refugees who never had a Palestinian State before Israel was declared and were never a nation or a people. That's the past. Now, there's no reason why they can't have a state (two-state solution) only there doesn't seem to be much progress with that. Meh.

For exactly that reason. Depends who you ask. Being a more religious Jew, I personally would have zero connection with Uganda if it was a Jewish State and wouldn't give a toss. Israel, however, is more religiously significant. I feel a connection, a tie to it. I suppose a Jewish State in Uganda would be okay but it still seems a bit pointless... may as well just stay in the Jewish communities in the diaspora if you're going to be having that.

Uganda was offered around 1903. And the land in Palestine was offered quite a while after that. After the Holocaust, whether that has bearing on the decision change, I'm not sure.

I'm not sure how Palestinians not being a nation before means they cannot have a state now that does have religious significance. If anything, they are most certainly a 'people' in one sense now.

I still think there is a question mark over the issue. The only other thing I'd ask so we don't go keep repeating ourselves is why wouldn't you care about Uganda being THE Jewish homeland. It would surely have that unique significance. Any other religious significance is just a plus, surely?

I don't think the Holocaust would have had too much of a bearing because the whole idea for a Jewish state was mapped out before that, and so I don't see how the Holocaust would provoke a need for a religiously significant land such as Israel. *shrug*

No, I know.

Uganda having a unique signifance? Such as what? Being completely random and having no significance to the Jewish people whatsoever? Just what exactly is the point in such a land. I mean I know it'd be a Jewish State which would be great and I see where you're coming from but I really can't describe how important it is that it's Israel and not somewhere else. It's the connection with the land and the fact that we were born there, our ancestors lived there and the fact that our holiest site is there makes it all special. In Israel, there are mitzvot (commandments) we can do that we can not do in the diaspora. G-d's presence is said to more concentrated there, and especially at the Western Wall, Jerusalem. Yes, that is a BIG plus..., if not an inherent reason per se. It is obvious, is it not, why Jews would choose the land that is promised by G-d in their Torah over Uganda.

Well, I don't know it all seems a little unclear.

You do?

Uganda had the significance of the possibility of giving refuge to those who were suffering anti-semitism etc. And what you continue to say puts such a heavy weight on religious significance of the land. Mitzvots? What do those mean? Why can't you do that in disapora? I don't know why an atheist/secular Jew in the early 20th Century would place SO MUCH emphasis on Israel. But, like I said, I think we're going to be repeating ourselves much of the way through this. You've said why you as a religious jew would think it of great importance and I think that is as much of answer I can get, from one person really. (I still have a question mark over the link in a much wider sense, but this is ask a jew, and I have asked one so I guess the point of this thread has been completed etc)
 
 
The only diffrence the holocaust ever made in terms of Israel was a UN resolution. Israel was recognised by the UN by a huge margin. There where already significant numbers of Jews in the madate land since the late 1800's and it was increasing steadily, the balfour decleration was in 1917 and whilst things may have mapped out diffrently, there would be an Israel either way, its not like the world decided, ahh we feel sorry for them lets give them Israel, it was 70 years in the making and the holocaust would not have changed much.

No. Zionism itself has no particular religiousity attached to it. Either you're pro-Israel or anti-Israel. Doesn't matter how religious you are or not or what religion you come from.

It's not Israel.
We cannot have a ''homeland'' other than Israel - Israel is our homeland - would be a bit like saying..hmm, right - all Muslims must now make the haj to a random village in Uzkekistan instead of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It just doesn't work!!

That's only partly it.

We believe that the land of Israel itself is inherently holy - yes many things in our history happened there yada yada but the land itself is inherently holy. That's why everything happened there, that's why our history is all centred in Israel, that's why we keep on wanting to return. That's why Israel is like no other place and that's another reason why we cannot have another country like Uganda for our ''homeland''.

Furthermore, the creation of the State of Israel were down by secular individuals. In a pragmatic move to gain wider support, they offered to enact some religious Jewish legislation in exchange for support from the haredim.

 

I don't particularly want to answer your post (and I think you know why), but since I put the question on this thread then I suppose I will.

In that case, Jewish culture is inherently linked to religion. (obviously) The point that matters then is, an attempt to make any concrete (which the the type of distinction that matters in these cases) distinction is in a way futile. Seeing as Judaism started life as a religion, culture is only ever a spin off of religion. (I'm talking any culture that has a link to religon). Any differences it does have to religion are purely factors that link to lifestyle for religious people somewhere along the line.

I thought it was dominated by those individuals at that time. Obviously, lending your support to any cause most of the time does not have to be made based on your own religious, ethnic, racial etc preferences etc. (not sure if preferences if the word I should be using there.   )

Ok, I appreciate that it has a religious significance for you and the conclusion I come to is that at least for you, the creation of a homeland is highly based on religious significance. And the Muslim holy land is Mecca sure. Shias and Sunnis go there, even though its Sunni dominated. Israel could still be a holy land for Jews no matter who dominates it etc. Mecca isn't a homeland though, so it's quite a different example.

Very true, but cultures can spin a very long way off over the course of centuries or even millenia, to the extent that while you can still trace the culture back to the religion, drawing any kind of realistic contemporary connection between the two becomes meaningless. 19th-century Christianity gave rise, for instance, to Liberalism, but it would be ridiculous to posit an inherently Christian (more precisely, Protestant) nature to modern Liberalism. It's like evolutionary divergence - both have moved on significantly and the present day finds them far more distant than they were to begin with. The same is true, in more general terms, of the gap between the cultural memes surrounding any religion and the core of that religion. Cultural Christianity has diverged immensely from a purely religious sense; Islamic culture hasn't had as long to do so but quite clearly shows the same thing. Judaism is thousands of years older than either, so consequently it's even more appropriate to distinguish the secular culture from the religious within the overarching label of "Judaism", because it's had far longer to develop and diverge.

Hmm, I see. Could you give some of the clearcut examples of secular culture that is distinguishable from the religious? Especially those that gave rise to the creation of Israel. (as that was part of my original question)

Why is lobster not kosher? And why can't you mix dairy and meat? I never got that one.
 
 
Probably health precautions.

The main example that comes to mind is the literary and theatrical culture surrounding the Yiddish language. Sure, its roots are firmly in Judaism, but it's evolved to the point where it's got virtually nothing to do with worshipping in a synagogue.

More tenuous links would be the success of Jews in public-speaking-related jobs due to the selection pressure that used to result from the combination of ghetto conditions and the now-vanished possibility of failing one's Bar Mitzvah, or the incalculable influence of Jews on the development of the American musical all the way from its birth to today.

I'm not sure how these are cultural foundations for creating Israel.

Linguistically, thats impossible. I thought they were called the Israelites? What was it about them that made them ''Jewish'' or Jews? How is one a Jew before the concept of Judaism, from which the whole idea of a Jew orginates? This seriously is one confusing religious/ethnic group.

 
 http://www.kosherkooking.com/What%20...non_kosher.htm 

Because the Torah says "Do not cook a kid [goat] in its' mother's milk" (Exodus 23:19), and that has been interpreted by the rabbis to mean that you can't eat meat and dairy together.
 

Ok. Why it is forbidden though? I suppose I could ask that for anything kosher, why is that pig is forbidden, what is that is actually wrong with it? After all, these are religious rules, what is the religious reasoning?
 
 
 
Ever heard of the twelve tribes of Israel? They originated from Jacob's/Israel's twelve children. This was long before the advent of Judaism the religion.
 

If i remember my RE classes most of these Tribes are missing. There were only two tribes and the name Judaism comes from the biggest one Judea. Are the missing going to come back?

Is that suposed to be a Joke? 12 tribes is taken as fact and so for you to be disproving this, i guess you must have gone and done original research as part of your RE course in order to hypothasize that.

Just about everyone has a system of hierarchy. I'm sure there were elders and wise men who had greater power than your average Jew. Then again, it wasn't really an issue because Jews lived under someone else's control until shortly before Judaism was created. Matrilineal descent existed before the Torah was given to the Jewish people. One was a member of the Jewish nation if his/her mother was Jewish.

 

I don't see how that explains how the term Jew was assigned to people before the advent of Judaism. I know about this whole Jewish nation and after Judaism was created - one is Jewish if their mother is a Jew, but I want to know before that. (you said that the Jewish nation was created after Moses, after the advent of Judaism and so on)

Are you saying the elders and wise men said who were Jews? I don't see how Jews living under another group's control explains anything there, really.

 
Because all Israelites were Jews, but not all Jews were Israelites. Also see point about Judea above.
 

Ok then.

 
Because the concept of interlinked Jewish tribes existed before the Jewish religion. You were a Jew if you were a member of one of the twelve tribes. A Jew is someone descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
 

So the rule that Abraham's, Issac's and Jacob's mothers weren't Jewish didn't apply? You may have to make some theological references here, I can't say I know too much of the myths surrounding these individuals.

 
My guess is that it had to do with the animal being unclean, which is why other animals that have features of insects are also banned.
 

I take it that this is your guess and no such reference is made in the Torah then?

What? I didn't do any research in RE. I don't know much about Judaism that is why i came to this thread. I don't know much about the tribes and I don't disapprove anything i don't know about. All I know is they were taken somewhere near Iraq.

In close knit communities, everyone knows who each other's parents are...

God made a covenant with Abraham (for being a monotheist), thus making him the first member of a Jewish nation. His wife became a Jew by merit of being a monotheist and wife to Abraham (you can't exactly have a ceremony when there are no other Jews). Isaac was thus Jewish. Isaac's wife became Jewish the same way, which means Jacob was Jewish, and so on.

It's something to do with eating cud and having split hooves. I'm not an expert on ancient biology.

 

I guess that pretty much answers that question. I think this is one of the few times you've actually been helpful - so thank you.

He used the word 'disprove' in a strange way, seeing as you said if you remember correctly back to RE etc.

During the time period of Herzl etc. Zionism tended to be 'Secular Zionism' yes. However, the concept of Zionism itself doesn't correlate to any particular branch of religion/ethnicity etc. as I stated above. Indeed, around Herzl's era was Rav Kook, who was the founder of 'Religious Zionism' and, as indicated by his title, was a Rabbi.

You catch my drift though - due to the reasons explained above we can only have Israel as our homeland.
Israel could still be our holy land and indeed homeland, no matter who controls it; however not all those who would wish to govern Israel would be willing or even accepting of that fact and would be rather unfriendly towards the Jews wanting to visit or live in Israel.

I presume you're referring to the '10 Lost Tribes'. Some of them are believed to have been ''found'' e.g. the Ethiopian Jews. The rest will return/be found when the Messiah comes.

Well I don't how prominent that group was, you'd need to say for more clarification.

Nuhuh. My religious level has no bearing on the subject at hand - I'm a Zionist hence I'm pro-Israel.
As said before - Zionism isn't correlated to one's religious level. It's become labelled as such due to its popularity amongst varying people but the theory of Zionism isn't so. e.g. Carl is Zionist but he isn't a religious Jew...he's not even Jewish!!

The erm... ''kook'' group. (I'm sorry, but that really is an unfortunate name)

I'm talking in relation to the original question. I'm not sure at which bit you jumped in at, but its the real link between religious vs cultural foundations for israel etc. I was questioning the religious aspects of its creation, but then got told I'm ignoring cultural aspects of Judaism. I don't know how that directly answers anything but 'tis the response I got. (and I still managed to say thank you at some point etc. I'm too nice, this has got to stop.)
 
 
I’m going to be asking this question in Ask a Jew, Ask a Muslim and Ask a Christian and if possible I’d like answers from the various perspectives in their own thread. It’s possible that the answers will be quite different:

Why does God no longer perform the great signs etc. that he used to?

(I’m not talking about the small things you may believe he does from day to day but about the truly epic things on the parting the Red Sea kind of scale.)

You've just stumbled upon an In-Jew joke! All of his books are called "Kook Books" and a seminary founded upon his teachings makes huge jokes out of being a 'Kook school' - recently in a choir competition they all turned up in aprons and chef's hats!  
Anyway, that's by the by - religious Zionism by individuals and small groups has always existed, however, it became a labelled recognised worldwide thing after Rav Kook. Mizrachi is the religious zionist movement and was founded in 1902. Bnei Akiva is the largest international religious Zionist movement and was started in 1929 in Israel (first English camp took place in 1939).
Hope that gives you a bit more info.  

Aw no c'mon David..continue being nice please, it's such a change from everyone sniping at each other. You see - you got some answers by being nice...when people go round flaming and insulting each other they never get answers, thus ending up even more disgruntled. Ok?
Riight..so, what exactly is/was your original question? The religious grounds for the creation of the State of Israel? If so I can give you loads and loads of sources.

The destruction of the temple meant that G-d's revelation is no longer majorly prominent by such big miracles, since we are in exile.

No. But it's rare and difficult to convert to Judaism.

Yes, but that's not a bad thing. As far as Judaism's concerned, quality not quantity is the thing to be aimed for in its converts. The conversion process takes in excess of two years, quite apart from being extremely physically daunting to men, so if you're still committed at the end of it all the chances of you being a bad apple are effectively nil.

No; it just stands to reason. Think of it as an extremely difficult entrance examination. You end up with far fewer people in your school, but those that do get in are absolutely rock-solid in their grasp of whatever the exam was about.

Why care? There are loadsa much more spirituality fulfilling religions out there. Well, at least in my opinion. Judaism, Islam and Christianity rehash the same religious principles. If I was forced to be monotheist I'd be Christian or Muslim. Plus, everyone knows Jesus was a socialist. If that doesn't boost its rating, what will?  
 
 
Yeah, I think the point to remember is we're not evangelical.

Yeah, but a person wouldn't convert unless they wanted to. Changing your religion is a lifestyle change, so you have to be committed if you do. And wht do you mean by 'a bad apple'?

oh sorry another question, why is it physically daunting for men, what about the women? (p.s sorry for my ignorance)

Is that connected with the idea (again, this may be wrong) that Jewish morality judges purely on the action and its results, not on the intentions behind it?

They don't always. It depends on the subject. In some cases the intention/belief behind something is more important than the practice (and this can apply to David's post above as well).

To be fair, it was the context of a Christian sermon on Jesus' relationship with the Noachide Law that I heard that, so an element of bias and skew is just a weensy bit possible.

So why quote it in here? A sermon about Christianity and Jesus is unlikely to pertain to modern Jewish practices - it's referring to a different religion with different laws, rules, regulations, ethics and morals.
It's like quoting a sermon about Buddha and asking in the ''Ask a Muslim'' thread if it's relevant to them.

Nope. In this thread I give answers according to Judaism.

We're not allowed to do anything which harms the body. Hence, smoking is forbidden (yes many Jews smoke but they're completely wrong). So too then - recreational drugs are forbidden.
 
 
The custom of Ad D'Lo Yoda seems to be in direct and glaring contradiction to that basic rule, because alcohol undeniably harms the body.

AS does raise a good point though: alcohol is bad for you yet Jews drink. I know you can say "well in moderation it doesn't hurt", but then, cocaine in moderation don't hurt you, weed in moderation don't hurt you.

Not at all. I'm personally strongly against any type of recreational drug usage and the often cited opinion that using these ''low rated'' drugs in moderation doesn'r harm you is complete codswallop as I've summarised below.
Long term usage of marijuana can result in the same diseases as smoking. In fact, the smoke from weed contains four times as much cancer-causing chemicals as tar does.   Moreover, cigarettes have been linked to an increased incidence of heart disease and lung cancer.
Cocaine, contrary to popular opinion is addictive. Whilst it may not have the same physical withdrawal effects as e.g. heroin, it has powerful psychological effects and very often leads the user to graduate onto harder/stronger drugs. Furthermore, prolonged cocaine snorting can lead to the collapse of the membrane in the nose (Daniella Westbrook) and cardiac arrest. It is used medically but not as much as it used to be due to its tendancy to constrict the blood vessels which often causes scarring.

With regard to alcohol - alcohol in moderation does not have any of these consequences, indeed, red wine is believed to contain antioxidant protection. However, whilst you might say ''a little of what you fancy does you good...''and so therefore for drugs, I think that my paragraph above shows how drugs differ from alcohol. Fyi, alocoholism isn't approved.

I know about long term effects, but all you've done there is back up my side of the argument.

having a tipple now and them us unlikely to do you any harm.
taking cocaine every so often is unlikely to do you any harm.
smoking a joint every so often is unlikely to do you any harm.

however in the long term all of these will harm you so why is there a divide (which just so happens to be in line with the modern legal division) between cocaine/weed and alcohol?
 
 
Isn't smoking it addictive? People get hooked onto drugs after just one try. After having e.g. one glass of wine you're not addicted.

no it's not physically addictive.

and no, people don't get hooked on drugs after just one try, not even coke.

Not really. I myself tried smoking lots of "stuffs" (you name it) for couple of times, though I tried cigarettes lots of times. But I never liked any of them, and 'addiction' never became an issue. And yes, it is forbidden in my religion to try or smoke any drug, be it in a small quantity or large.

However, the sheer atmosphere of drinking just gets you in the mood of addiction. Though drinking a little does not make you drunk or harm your body that much, this is equally true for drugs. If harming your body is what determines what is allowed and not, then drinking must fall in that category as well unless there are some explicit guidances about the quantity of it.
 
 
Just to add further to Helen's point; alcohol is often used in Judaism for spiritual purposes, like on Shabbat to sanctify it. We use wine for  kiddush . Shabbat is considered a special day where we use/eat/have the best of everything, and that means some nice wine.
 
 
To those seemingly trying to make a point about how Judaism is 'wrong' on matters of drugs, you have been told in this thread that Judaism says what harms the body is wrong. Strangely enough, there is no passage in the Torah that says 'Cocaine harms the body'. If the general consensus in the Jewish community and the community at large was that cocaine does not harm it, there would be nothing inconsistent in allowing it. However, that isn't the general consensus in society at all, hence why it is illegal in all forms. The reverse applies for alcohol.

oh dear. I thought cocaine was relatively safe, like weed.

I suppose that explains why Jews shouldn't take coke, but still not weed.
 
 
I don't know why you are so interested in this, its no different for Judaism than the rest of civilised society. We have laws against drugs because they are perceived to do us harm, as would most Jews not take drugs because they perceive them to do harm. Why don't you ask some Jews who live in a country where weed etc are legalised if you want a potentially more interesting response? Your argument applies equally for any society where alcohol is legal and weed is not.

So an exception is made such that it's culturally accepted within certain parameters, despite being technically hazardous to health. Fair enough.

I don't see how a glass of wine on Shabbat for kiddush is hazardous to health, but okay. Anyway, read what cheesecakebobby has written. It's pretty simple. Society accepts alcohol; it's legal. Drugs are not. There's a reason for this. So you can all argue as much as you want how alcohol could technically be dangerous to one's health but the fact that it's legal and is accepted by the majority of today's society suggests that there isn't anything inherently wrong or dangerous in consuming alcohol.

I think it also might be useful to know that Judaism isn't promoting binge drinking and arbitrary drunkeness. Alcohol should be used for good reasons; to celebrate or for a special occasion. So whilst alcohol is allowed, it shouldn't be misused. The rabbis get very annoyed at Purim time when people drink for the wrong reasons. People (mostly teenagers) assume that it is a time to get drunk, an excuse to get drunk even. This is totally the wrong attitude; the idea of getting drunk on Purim is more profound in that the alcohol consumed should be done with spiritual intentions, and therefore allowing the individual to experience the true essence of Purim.

That's pretty shaky logic, but I don't feel like squaring up for a fight right now. I'll just say that yes, in small quantities, the benefits of alcohol do appear to outweigh the advantages, so to class it as simply "good for you" or "bad for you" may not actually be such a good idea after all.

And is the cross-dressing done with spiritual intentions too?   Viewed from the outside, I have to say it is hard not to see Purim as having evolved into a chance to let one's hair down.

Unlike chocolate etc, alcohol is a drug and as such is addictive. Anyway, this will turn into a thread about alcohol which is unnecessary.
 
 
It doesn't have to be a drug to be addictive. People can and do become genuinely addicted to all kinds of things and activities. It's at least as much a psychological as a biochemical phenomenon.

Many prescription medicines can become addictive, they too are drugs. I just felt I should step in as this is yet another occasion where its more 'interrogate a Jew' rather than 'ask a Jew', and the same thing happens in the other 'ask a' threads. There's nothing unreasonable about religious teachings on this particular matter and we were given an answer ages ago, but rather than ask another question many members would rather keep pushing at it.

More people are admitted with obesisty related illnesses than alcoholism related illnesses. Does that mean food is more addictive than alcohol?

It does have the potential to be addictive, yes, but simply from an observational point of view I must say that an awful lot of people seem to get by without becoming addicted to it - even though they may be fairly heavy drinkers. Compared to other substances, which can get you hooked from the first time you try them, alcohol appears almost benign.

Whilst I'm certainly not going to be arguing that chocolate should be considered on par with cocaine etc. you can't claim that. ^

Chocolate contains anandamide, caffeine and phenylethylamine. It's also full of chemicals which mess around with serotonin and endorphins. Addiction to Chocolate is a reality in a biochemical sense in addition to any psychological factors.

True... if one takes hormones into account the list of potential "addictions" becomes truly colossal.

Love as an addiction to endorphins? Even religion? I'm sure if you monitored the human body carefully during worship or prayer, there'd be some hormonal stuff happening.

No fight? Dammit. Anyway, alcohol is one of those things that when used properly (and in moderation) doesn't really have a negative effect. Another example is chocolate. Used properly, it creates wonders.

  Cross dressing?!   I think that's frowned upon even on Purim. More like fancy dress...

Ok, I can see how it does look like that from the outside. Yes, it's meant to be a happy time. A very jolly time, indeed. Hence the alcohol. This is why everything done (dressing up, drinking, etc) should all be done bearing in mind WHY you're doing it in the first place, rather than just a chance to act like an idiot for the day.

Definitely, it's a probable source of the "feeling" a lot of people get when they are praying. There's a very fine line between habit and addiction.

However   *ahem*

The concept of being "addicted" to one's partner, or to love itself, is a staple of the artistic, particularly the music, world... regarding religion, though, we're likely to meet with some hostile responses if we push the idea of it being in the same bracket as crack any further. Also, I suspect the act of praying induces very different responses/feelings in different people, so to put it all down to hormonal activity is probably unwise.

Just to add one more thing - a lot of the new wave of Christianity ("God Rock" and the Alpha Course and such) seems to push metaphors very like that of addiction - provocative and thought-provoking slogans are used, in the spirit of the more common concept of being "on fire for God", and I can very well see something like "addicted to Jesus" featuring among them. In the light of this hormones stuff, it seems weirdly recursive.

It can...but it won't.

End. Of. Topic.

Next question?
 
 
maybe, tell me the topic and i'll try. Seriously, is the only hooved animals thing only practised by orthodox jews? What's the reasoning behind it? I read they're seen as dirty animals but that isn't really true anymore.
 
 
If you imagine a hypothetical Ur-Jew (ie representing the whole spectrum of Jewness) moving from ultra-orthodox to liberal, dropping customs and practices along the way, I think it's fair to say that the kosher laws are one of the last things they'd retain. Even most secular Jews keep them - sometimes, admittedly, for a given value of "keep".

No; what makes you think some laws apply to some people and not others? Keeping kosher is applicable to all Jews and no, it's not just the Orthodox Jews that do it, as AS said. It's often one of the only things many secular Jews do keep. Don't know why it's that way but it just is. The reason? It's one of the laws in the Torah that we are not given reasons for (there's not that many, but this is one), but there are many possible reasons suggested such as animals without split hooves and that don't chew the cud are considered violent. Indeed, a kosher animal is not a carnivore. So it could be argued that "you are what you eat" and so we don't eat animals who have violent tendencies. That isn't a concrete answer, it's just one of the possible explanations. And it isn't really an issue of cleanliness, no.

Because the lack of any reason I could think of or find out made me think it would mean the more progressive sections of the religion had dropped it.

Fair enough. Some of them probably have dropped it because there isn't much that Progressive Jews haven't dropped really. Some do still keep kosher though.
 
 
Re Kosher: From a secular, atheist, gentile, social scientist perspective, I assume it has to do with the extremely rudimentary food hygiene procedures around at the time the laws were written... Having it be 'a law from god' was an easy way for the tribe to pass on the knowledge that eating pigs was, at the time, not a good long-term survival strategy, as it was likely to make you ill.

Indeed, but that's certainly not the Jewish view.

Well, quite. Hence why I prefaced it with 'from an atheist, secular, gentile, social scientist' point of view. And given that the question was about why a certain aspect of Judaism is why it is, rather than a Jewish opinion on, say, whether Chocolate or Plain Hobnobs are superior, I felt it was a valid contribution...

which is more interesting, the Talmud or the Torah?

That's very subjective. There are interesting and boring bits of both.

Certainly the Torah has a greater importance within the religion and contains the "entertaining" Biblical stories which are famous globally.

However, some of the 3rd book of the Torah (Vayikra or Leviticus depending on which language you prefer) contains a lot of laws, a some would consider this to be quite dry.

The Talmud on the other hand isa compilation of Rabbinical debates and discussions over a 300 year period. If you are so inclined, you may find this commentary fascinating, and there are certainly (I am told by those who learn properly) some interesting insights which could not have been garnered by just reading the Torah on its own. The Talmud also considers arguments beyond the realms of the Torah.

On the other hand, again, for those not so interested in this heavily intellectual discussion, it can seem dry. It also depends on your own area of interest. There will be sections which are both fascinating and extremely boring to a person within the Talmud.
 
 
 Latkes or Hamentaschen?

It's gotta be latkes. God they're nice

On the other hand I don't like poppy seeds and I'm allergic to chocolate so I'm a bit buggered on both forms of the Hamentaschen.

I should add jam is also minging in them.

But latkes! Is there a greater use of the potato?

They're both of equal interest and importance. The Torah is actually incomprehensible without the Talmud since the Torah is ambiguous about certain commandments, etc. The Talmud has commandments that aren't in the Torah and it clarifies those that are. For example, in the Torah we're told to wear tefillin. What are tefillin even? This is explained in the Talmud. The difference between the Talmud and the Torah is that the former was transmitted orally and the latter was written down straight away. Therefore the Talmud has been subject to discussion amongst rabbis. They're both the Torah and they're both from G-d.
 
 
ok cool, thanks for answers

We should actually clarify this. The Talmud is comprised of two parts, the Mishnah (oral law) and Gemara (the commentary). When people say they study Talmud, they usually study the Gemara, which is the rabbinic debate.

The Mishnah is as important as the Torah. But the Gemara...well perhaps gemgems will argue with me, but I just don't think it is. In Judaism, divine law is more important than rabbinic law.

I think debates between rabbis spanning 300 years would be pretty interesting tbh.

I ask because i was interested in reading one. I've read a lot of the bible and parts of the koran and wanted to read something from Judaism but wondered which would be more interesting.

The Mishnah consists of lots and lots of laws with ''Rabbi X states this and Rabbi Y states that.'' So if you're looking for a ''book to read'' - don't pick the Mishnah.

The Gemara isn't really a book you can pick up to read on the train. Firstly, you can't purchase a nice english story version of it - it's a book to be studied. Most editions remain in the original Aramaic (the Steinhaltz does a v nice version with punctuation) and the Artscroll has an English translation.
Learning how to study Gemara properly takes a few years and is rather frustrating (although extremely rewarding).
So, don't pick the Gemara either.  

They're not the type of thing one can idly flick through and find scintillating.

Something that could be said for any book of that level...
 
 
Au contraire. Christians are encouraged to simply "dip into" the Bible, for starters. It's a question of accessibility. Whether it's actually a good thing for a holy text to be more or less accessible is another matter...

There's actually a debate as to how inaccesible studying of the Talmud is. It certainly does require a lot of time, effort and understanding to learn properly, but I believe that Talmudic study was much more widespread in days gone by than it is today.

If I wanted to, I could go to a Yeshivah (a Jewish seminary for study) and learn. I just have no motivation to because I'm an assimilated Jew. Perhaps it could be argued that the more assimilated we become, the less prevalent Talmudic study becomes.

Anyone could learn Talmud if they wanted, I just think that many Jews aren't interested anymore.

Well some people believe dipping into holy texts is the way forward (re: the Quran) but I lean towards the disagreeing side. Its hardly a book you can pick up and read on the train. It has many layers of meaning for starters.

Not to compare, but on the subject of reading material, you wouldn't just pick up Marx or Macheivaelli or Mill to read on the train either. So it isn't just about holy "books", so to speak. It would depend on the content as well.

Now I'm rambling...so I'll stop.

The Talmud isn't a ''holy text'' in the way you describe it to be - when closing the Torah one kisses the cover, you're not allowed to put anything on top of a Torah; however, you don't for the Mishna/Gemara.

They're vvvvvv important books and Judaism could not be properly practiced were it not for their existence - as Gemz explained above, the Torah contains the Written Law and the Talmud comprises the Oral Law which clarifies and explains the former.

Not at all inaccesible. I disagree - today, kids in primary school are learning Gemara - heck, my younger brother can fairly fluently read and translate a page of Gemara with commentaries!

Perhaps rephrase to: it could be argued that the more assimilated we become, the less prevalent all Jewish study becomes.

Again, I completely disagree - maybe because you're assimilated you haven't experienced the vast Talmudic knowledge and learning that exists within Jewish curriculams. Learning Talmud is as vital as learning the Tanach.

I could learn Hebrew properly and then translate the Gemara, but it doesn't mean I would understand it, and I'm nearly 20. How is a primary school kid supposed to understand the subtleties and concepts of the Gemara? This takes years of study before one can do this adequately.

As I said, if I wanted to go to Yeshivah in Israel for a year I could have, but I have absolutely no desire to do this. I come from an Orthodox background, but I'd rather learn about the law of the land I live in than the laws of my religion. I'm sure many British Jews feel the same. I'm not even interested in learning Tanach anymore, some of it is so utterly nonsensical that it seems an utter waste of time to me. However, the door is certainly always open to me if I want. I have known (as I'm sure many of us have) really irreligious people suddenly transformed into Lubavitch.Tanach and Talmud study is available for everyone, but people just aren't interested.

In any case, it doesn't matter, the bottom line is to some studying Gemara is worthwhile, and this position should be respected, and likewise to some it's not.

of course you would!

I read Machiavelli when i was at school just for fun. Read Mill last week.
 
 
I don't see how the Gemara compares to Marx.

Check  this  out, methinks.

O God (groan!!!!)

I read FHM at school (still do occasionally in fact). That's because I'm normal. I fail to understand why anyone would read that unless they absolutely had to (clearly I'm just not intellectual enough).

Another interesting question:

Why do you think anti-semitism and persecution of the Jews have been such constants throughout history? Other religions have been persecuted to some extent, but it seems a bit ridiculous with the Jews. Why is this?
