It was another scorching day in New York, but in his
short-sleeve shirt, black jeans and snakeskin shoes, Dr. John, the
piano-playing, politically assertive singer and songwriter from New
Orleans, was quite comfortable.

"I don't like to be cold," said Dr. John, who was born Malcolm
John Rebennack Jr., and is known to his friends as Mac.

At 6 on a recent evening, he was making his way along West
Harlem Piers Park on 125th Street and the Hudson River. The sun was
still bright and the water beckoned. Cyclists whizzed by; children
ran down the walk. No one seemed to recognize the Grammy-winning
performer, who adopted his stage name from a voodoo practitioner
who lived in the early 1800s.

Not that he didn't stand out with his wooden walking stick,
which he clutched like a scepter; it was adorned with voodoo beads,
key rings from Narcotics Anonymous, a yak bone, a subway token, an
alligator tooth, feathers and crystals.

Now 20 years heroin-free, Dr. John could pass for a decade
younger than his 69 years; his face is barely lined. On this
particular day he said he was tired, having recently completed a
monthlong European tour to promote his latest album, "Tribal" -- a
gumbo of jazz, funk and rock peppered with Creole and R&B -- which
was released earlier this month.

He sat down on a bench and lighted a Dominican cigar (which he
calls a "square") and said he liked it there, by the water; it
reminded him of New Orleans, his hometown, where he spends much of
the year. He also rents a "pad" in Washington Heights, where he
stays on and off and where many of the residents are Hispanic.

"It's nice," he said. "I relate to people up there that kind
of hangs on the streets."

Does he speak Spanish?

"No," he said. "I don't even speak English."

In a way, he's not kidding. Talking with Dr. John is an
adventure. And a treat. After all, this is the guy who is
responsible for lyrics like "I walk on gilded splinters."

Still, it can be challenging to follow him. His voice hovers
between a growl and a whisper, and made-up words burst from his
lips. A message is a "massage." A text becomes a "textile."
Louisiana's governor, Bobby Jindal, is "Bobby Jingle Bells," as
in: "For a minute during the BP mess, I liked Bobby Jingle Bells.
For a minute." And now? "He's the kind of politician who makes me
nauseated."

He can also be vague. When asked how many children he had, he
answered, "A lot." And how many grandchildren? "Enough."

His conversation meanders with seemingly no connective thread;
eventually, certain themes emerge: Louisiana, offshore drilling,
Hurricane Katrina, the joys of eating goats' eyeballs ("When you
get the hard part out, they're delicious") and drinking, which he
never enjoyed. "I killed all my mother's plants 'cause I poured
wine in there," he said.

And then there is Barack Obama, "The first person I voted for
since John Kennedy who won," he said. "For a lot of years I
didn't vote. After Nixon and Reagan I got disgusted with
politics."

He still is. Indeed, on this topic he is quite articulate. "I'm
sitting in Europe and I see Barack Obama on TV being nice to the
British prime minister" after the BP oil spill. "I ain't
prejudiced against British people. I got friends who are British.
But did we really win the Revolution?"

"I don't feel like I can trust anybody, anywhere," he said.
For that reason, he doesn't read newspapers and doesn't have an
e-mail address or even a computer. But he does have a cell phone
(Louis Armstrong's music is one of his ringtones), which
compensates for the lack of e-mail: "I can text on the phone, and
even then I know it's being monitored somewhere by someone."

He is outraged by the government's response to the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill and Hurricane Katrina. His 2008 album, "City That
Care Forgot," which is about New Orleans after the deluge, won the
2009 Grammy for best contemporary blues album. He is still
collecting money for New Orleans charities. On his website,
drjohn.org, he notes that "As a gesture of thankfulnessments to
his fans and with no profitabilitary to hisself, Dr. John is
offerin' up some drawers in honoroficalness of NOLA, his
hometown."

Does he have hope that things will improve? He shrugs.

"One day you're on top of the world, and the next day the
world's on top of you," he said. "That's life."

As for him right now? "I'm somewhere in the middle."
