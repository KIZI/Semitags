I know you guys are smarting a bit over the Broncs recent outings...but it's
hard to be too sympathetic since the S&B are STILL trying to overcome our
ongoing malaise... anyway, to change the subject:

Damn!  Those Nuggets are looking solid tonight!   I have a feeling they are
gonna be a force in the West this season.   Thoughts?

Well Clark, there is life other than football.. and being a BBall fan I
thought this might be a good time to discuss the new NBA season.   If you
don't care that's fine, just ignore this thread.   But I know there are some
in the "newsfroup" that do have some interest.  You can go back to fretting
over what Shanny will do next.

I don't watch the NBA until about mid-April.  I may actually follow the
occasional box score this season as I do have a fantasy team hot on the
heels of my fantasy baseball championship.  Other than that, SportsCenter
more than fills the need.

Until then, it's all about the MIGHTY INDIANA HOOSIERS!!!

Indiana, Indiana, Indiana, we're all for you!
We will fight for the Cream & Crimson
and the glory of old I. U. (I. U.!)
Never daunted, we will not falter
in the battle we're tried and true!
Indiana!  O Indiana!  Indiana we're all for you!
<bom bom bomm bommm bommmm BOMMMMM!>  I. U.!

Mmmmm!  I think I'll have to dig out my '89 Big Ten Champs shirt for work
tomorrow!

You say that like it's a bad thing!  Make a play JC!!!  Like a mechanic
friend used to laugh when I'd slam the stickshift to coax the gears to
engage, "That's it - Make 'er fit!"

Hey, the Avalanche ain't doing too bad either. They're looking to get Denver
picked as The Sporting News' #1 sports city again. Or something.

I bet most people doing rankings have the Nuggets above any East team
- but with 3-4 teams ahead of them in the West.

If they play some D, push the tempo, and move the ball around, they could be
unreal.  The problem is, they don't always do those things.   They could be
the most talented and deepest team in the league.  AI was great at both ends
last night.  7 steals and 14 assists?  That is pretty much what you want
from your point guard who also happens to be one of the best scorers in the
history of the game.

Apparently we've struck a happy medium.  Two years ago my long and
contentious relationship with manuals ended and I've owned an automatic.

Now the turbo and I have ongoing issues.

Ahhh, I think some other town may have a lock on that one this year
regardless of how the Bruins finish.  But that's okay.  You got Estes and a
cool mayor and they got a tunnel that gorges itself on tax dollars and Mitt
Romney.  Let 'em have their sports town thingy.

Yeah, SC provides plenty of hhops coverage for me too.  I'll watch the
Nuggies if the game is not too late or on a weekend, but I won't get much chance
here anyway.
I spend almost no time on college hoops, prolly because Colorado teams don't
either.

On another note, I'm really pleased to see one of the original Rockies become
the Yankees manager.  I might actually root for the shitheads a little now.

I hope the poor medium was not too injured in the collision.  Probably
not happy any more.

With the Pats kickin' everybody's asses, the Bosox winning the WS, Boston
College undefeated, the Bruins are 7-4, and the Celtics are hip hop-deep in
hype.  Methinks Beantown has that title wrapped up for this year.

Other than the Rocks and Nuggets, it would seem this is a transitional year.
I'm thinkin' next year.

Yep.  Also, judging from the way Hawkins has progressed CU so far, another year
might well see them in the top 25 again.

You don't think this seemed to be a transitional year for the Rockies?

I suspect the Broncos aren't in transition so much - next year they
will be back to contend to make the playoffs as they have been since
they were great.

Unfortunately, the Rams are the same as last year though.

The Nuggets and the Avalanche probably will be similarly better than
last year - if injuries don't dictate otherwise.
