There was an Analysis for the WTC Towers, that considered a 707 impacting.
most do agree on that. but there is however a discussion about the considered speed.

According to L.Robertson, the Chief Structural Engineer of the WTC. it was a slow flying 707, trying to land, lost in the fog.

but according to NIST investigation, it was considering a 707 at top speed, 600 MH.

Who is right, and can both backup theyr claims?

NIST or Robertson?
did Robertson backup his claim?

Nothing about the speed there.
 
 
You're right, there isn't. However, what there is, is this:

 
NIST investigators were unable to locate any documentation of the criteria and method used in the impact analysis

 
Which at the very least renders your OP completely moot. It's not a case of NIST versus the lead structural engineer.
 
 
 
Nothing about the speed there.

 

 
However, NIST investigators were unable to locate any documentation of the criteria and method used in the impact analysis and, therefore, were unable to verify the assertion that  such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building.

 
i think first we need to establish this analysis was even done before we start talking about the assumptions used in it

on another note, p4t should update their site so the pictures they show are actually from the document they link to, lol
 
 
Umm, it was FEMA making the "lost in fog" claim, not Robertson. See NIST NCSTAR 1-2 section 1.3 on page 4.

thats already in here

i know they didnt find the Calculations themself. but Nist and Robertson both agree on an Analysis, the point is just what was the considered speed?
nist has found documents that mention 600 MPH. wich contradict Robertson's words of a slow flying plane.

has robertson anything that would backup his words?
 
 
Interesting that the document has "Draft for public comment" in top right hand corner.

DC,

Three things:

1. There is no documentation to back up the claim in this single draft document

2. The lead structural engineer and NIST agree that the towers wouldn't (indeed, COULDN'T) be designed with any degree of accuracy to take into account a full on high speed crash by a fuel laden commercial jet.

3. If engineers never had their calculations tested by reality no buildings or structures would have ever failed.
 
 
 
has robertson anything that would backup his words?

 

It wasn't Robertson making that claim, it was FEMA in 2002.

no, NIST is not "agreeing" they are simply reproducing a document from the port authority

the architectural design of the WTC was unveiled 1-18-64, after which the engineering firm was begin working on how to actually build the structure, the PANYNJ document is dated barely 2 weeks after the architectural design was shown, i highly doubt the structural design was completed and tested by that point
 
 
Robertson did make that claim in Bridge magazine:

 http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf...ks/CGOZ-58NLCB 
 
 
Dictator Cheney, have you actually read the entire NIST report?

Aha! That must be where FEMA got it from.

In context, I do not see a necessary contradiction. The way I read that, it sounds like the engineers made assumptions about plausible scenarios (lost and trying to land), but made the calculations based on a worst-case condition, as many engineers do on a regular basis. It sounds like the truth movement is developing a false dichotomy here.

ETA: DC, yes I have read the whole NIST report. It really helps to know the arguments in context. Cherry-picking is rampant in these debates.
 
 
Why would an aircraft be coming in to land at 600mph? Surely an error about the speed has crept in somewhere. Anyway, this has come up before; the 600mph figure was mentioned in a 1964  NYT article  :

 
Richard Roth of the architectural firm of Emery Roth & Sons issued the statement defending the safety of the twin towers, which the firm, in association with Minoru Yamasaki, designed for the center.

Mr. Roth said that a structural analysis by the firm of Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson had found that if a tower were hit by an airliner at 600 miles an hour, the damage to the tower would be only local and its occupants outside the immediate area of impact would not be endangered.

the article is dated 2-15-64, the document reproduced in the NIST report is dated 2-3-64, so its probably the source for the NYT article
 
 
has nothing to do with cherry picking, i just wonder why those diffrent claims.

even if they considered it at 100 MPH

the towers still witstood the impacts, atleast for 1 hour.

It has everything to do with cherry-picking. Contrasting only those two phrases out of context gives people a false impression that there must be a conflict. It is entirely plausible that both statements are true as I demonstrated in my previous post.

 
even if they considered it at 100 MPH

the towers still witstood the impacts, atleast for 1 hour.

 

I agree, it is a tribute to how well the design worked. It took a combination of events to bring the towers down, and the fact that they did withstand the impacts as long as they did was a testament to the designers and a life-saver for many of those who worked there.

well the 600mph firm appears to have come from the architectural firm, and lower speed from the engineering firm

well the way the Robertson interview is shown, its a little missleading. one could assume, that those 600 MPH was never mentioned. like i got told by so many OCTers on other forums. they only know the Robertson side of the story.

and they think that Robertsons interview "Debunks" the claim that 600 MPH was considered.
 
 
i spammed

OCTers? have you been talking to killtown lately?

and as i mentioned, the 600mph claim appears to come from the architectural firm, lower speeds from the engineering firm

essentially what we have is richard roth (from the architect firm) says the engineers considered 600mph, which leslie robertson (from the engineering firm) says they considered a lower speed

so we essentially have a second hand source disagreeing with a firsthand source, who do you think has more credibility in the matter?

however as i also mentioned previously no evidence exists (other than anecdotal) to indicate either analysis ever took place or was part of the design considerations

i think Robertson is not a very good scource, when you listen to his interviews carefully. he is not sure, he didnt even know if Fires was considered or not. doesnt sound like he has a good memory on that topic.

i think what was writen down in the 60's is prolly more accurate than the memory of 1 man.
 
 
How many floors of IBM's would they need, to compute a fire and structure sim,for the towers in the 60's?

do you think they did it with computers? if so, why do you think so?
the documents say nothing about computers, they talk about 1200 pages and 100 drawings. i was pretty confinsed they didnt do FEA model syms
 
 
That was sarcasm, in the form of a question. Sorry, I don't do the smilie thing.
To model all the variables, is tough today.
 
 
ah sorry then.
got some trouble spoting sarcasm in english
 
 
The following is from an article by James Glanz of the New York Times.

 
he recalls that he addressed the question of an airplane collision,
if only to satisfy his engineer's curiosity. For whatever reason,
Robertson took the time to calculate how well his towers would handle the
impact from a Boeing 707, the largest jetliner in service at the time. He
says that his calculations assumed a plane lost in a fog while searching
for an airport at relatively low speed, like the B-25 bomber. He concluded
that the towers would remain standing despite the force of the impact and
the hole it would punch out. The new technologies he had installed after
the motion experiments and wind-tunnel work had created a structure more
than strong enough to withstand such a blow.

Exactly how Robertson performed these calculations is apparently lost --
he says he cannot find a copy of the report. Several engineers who worked
with him at the time, including the director of his computer department,
say they have no recollection of ever seeing the study. But the Port
Authority, eager to mount a counterattack against Wien, seized on the
results -- and may in fact have exaggerated them. One architect working
for the Port Authority issued a statement to the press, covered in a
prominent article in The Times, explaining that Robertson's study proved
that the towers could withstand the impact of a jetliner moving at 600
miles an hour. That was perhaps three times the speed that Robertson had
considered. If Robertson saw the article in the paper, he never spoke up
about the discrepancy. No one else issued a correction, and the question
was answered in many people's minds: the towers were as safe as could be
expected, even in the most cataclysmic of circumstances.

There were only two problems. The first, of course, was that no study of
the impact of a 600-mile-an-hour plane ever existed. ''That's got nothing
to do with the reality of what we did,'' Robertson snapped when shown the
Port Authority architect's statement more than three decades later.
The second problem was that no one thought to take into account the fires
that would inevitably break out when the jetliner's fuel exploded, exactly
as the B-25's had. And if Wien was the trade center's Cassandra, fire
protection would become its Achilles' heel.

mmhh Robertson is strange.

its his calculations, but he doesnt know the exact speed anymore they considered?

and also the Fires. The towers did consider fires, they did take intoaccount the spreading of fires, but when it comes to the impact of a 707 noone was thinking about the Fires?

this sounds strange to me.
 
 
1. As far as I know, the calculations themseves have never been produced.

2. The Towers did withstand the impact, but not the combination of fire and impact.

3. How do you suppose this would be modelled, bearing in mind that there would be no access to complex computer simulations at the time?

My understanding is that from a sample of one, they considered a plane lost and trying to land would be reasonably low on fuel

And are you claiming the WTC had no retardation systems?

Can you remember details of something you did 30 years ago? (were you even born then?)

It would depend on who was responsible for the fire protection of the building. Many times, fire protection is the architect's responsibility, not the structural engineers.

so they never made this Analysis? they just claimed they have done it?
 
 
We have no calculations. It may have been highly simplified. We don't know how they modelled envelope damage, whether it extended to the core, and so on. So basically all we have is speculation, which isn't particularly helpful - is it?
 
 
 
That was sarcasm, in the form of a question. Sorry, I don't do the smilie thing.

Did the technology even exist to do it back then? As far as I can tell there would have been problems. Huge big problems using computers for the first time in such an environment have been documented when CAD was used for the first time.
 
 
DC, Robertson said to the best of his knowledge, the effect of fuel had not been considered in the design.
 
 
 
so they never made this Analysis? they just claimed they have done it?

 
Since they were describing an EXTREMELY remote possibility, they probably thought a detailed analysis wouldn't be required.

And what would they do if they found out from their analysis that it would indeed collapse from an airliner impact...completely redesign the building? Because of something that was almost guaranteed to never happen? What would the investors think of this, when asked to fork over twice the amount they agreed to, just in case something incredibly unlikely happened?

There's the way things SHOULD work and the way things DO work. Sometimes the only way to tell the difference is to create the conditions in practice and see the results for yourself. That was obviously unthinkable here.

I'm not an architect or engineer (although I did enjoy playing with Meccano sets when I was a kid), but this sounds more to me like something he did outside of the scope of the project - as it says, to 'satisfy his engineer's curiousity'. I can envision him sitting at the dinner table with his slide rule mumbling to himself while his dinner gets cold before finally just shrugging and muttering something along the lines of 'sure, I guess they'll stand'.

Sorry, it was Robertson. They should have asked him. Like you, NIST made an error. Simple research would give you the facts on this.

Here is how it works, at 6 pm PST I will repost Robertson’s work on this after you fail to find it due to your trutherness. Blinders are on all 9/11 truth members who seem to lack the logic to make rational conclusions on 9/11. Why is that?

too bad you can not source the NIST claim, they also said they could not; oops you are exposing yourself as a hearsay person... you should read what they said

of course others have sourced the truth to you already - Robertson will back that up

I will ask my first graders how to look up information, and post the results from the first graders tonight; 6 pm PST. They should be having a fantastic time laughing at how people can glom onto the minutiae and make up stories!

Case in point - how many buildings conceived since 9/11 have been designed to withstand the impact of a fully fueled 757 travelling at high speed?
 
 
 
How many floors of IBM's would they need, to compute a fire and structure sim,for the towers in the 60's?

 
And it wouldn't be the first time an engineering design that may or may not have considered some extreme conditions failed when those conditions were actually encountered. c.f. Two Space Shuttles, the Titanic, and my favorite, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.

IIRC, FAA regulations forbid flying at speeds greater than 250 knots at altitudes less than 10,000 feet.

Doe anyone know when that rule was promulgated? If it were in place during the design phase of the WTC towers, there would have been no reason to consider greater speeds in calculating the effects of a collision by a lost plane looking for the airport, since no sane pilot with functioning altitude and airspeed indicators would have been going that fast at that height.

OTOH, if you were considering the worst-case scenario of a crippled, out-of-control airliner in a death dive, that would have been a kettle of fish of a different color.

Yup - there's really no meaningful way to discuss landing a 707 at 600 mph. The correct phrase would be "impacting terrain."
 
 
Ultimately it was the fires from the jet fuel that caused collapse, and when the WTC was constructed there was no way to simulate the effect of fuel dispersal and fire on the building.

Ergo, any claims about the building's survivability from the 1960's are meaningless.
 
 
There's a few more examples of tall building/aircraft encounters in NYC in the full text of the  NYT article  Alferd Packer linked to at #28. I'd heard about the B-25 and the Empire State Building, but not the others:

 
But Robertson still had one more set of structural calculations to perform. Lawrence Wien, who was continuing his fight against the towers, had begun to remind New Yorkers publicly of a Saturday morning in July 1945, when a B-25 bomber, lost in the fog, barreled into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building. Most of the 14 people who died were incinerated by a fireball created when the plane's fuel ignited, even though the fire was quickly contained. The following year, another plane crashed into the 72-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, and yet another one narrowly missed the Empire State Building, terrifying sightseers on the observation deck.

Wien and his committee charged that the twin towers, with their broader and higher tops, would represent an even greater risk of midair collision. They ran a nearly full-page ad* in The Times with an artist's rendition of a commercial airliner about to ram one of the towers. ''Unfortunately, we rarely recognize how serious these problems are until it's too late to do anything,'' the caption said.

The Port Authority was already trying to line up the thousands of tenants it would need to fill the acres of office space in the towers. Such a frightful vision could not be left unchallenged. Robertson says that he never saw the ad and was ignorant of the political battle behind it.

 
And later, after the Towers were built:

 
As the Port Authority was struggling to ease the public's concerns about fire, a different and more terrifying specter arrived without warning, from the direction of the Statue of Liberty. Late on the night of Feb. 20, 1981, an Aerolineas Argentinas Boeing 707, flying in the clouds on its way to Kennedy Airport, improperly descended to an altitude lower than the tip of the north tower's television mast -- and on a course straight for the tower. The 58 passengers and crew members were less than 90 seconds from the towers when an altitude radar alarm sounded in the air-traffic-control facility. ''Argentine 342!'' the air-traffic controller said frantically. ''Climb! Climb immediately!'' It was such a close call that the controller on duty went out on traumatic-injury leave.

 

* The ad, or one of them, is here:

Of course NIST does not have first person confirmation on 600 mph. Do they? No. Why can you not do your own research and get something right.

 
Leslie E. Robertson said:
"The twin towers of the World Trade Center were designed to resist safely the impacting by the largest aircraft of that time...the intercontinental version of the Boeing 707. In no small measure because of the high level of competence of the men and women of LERA, each of the towers resisted the impact of an aircraft larger than the 707. Yes, fire brought down the towers, but the structural integrity created by the engineers of LERA allowed perhaps thousands of persons to evacuate the buildings prior to the fire-induced collapse."  http://www.engr.psu.edu/ae/WTC/LesRobertson.html 

Leslie E. Robertson said: on being hit by a commercial jet -
" It appears that about 25,000 people safely exited the buildings, almost all of them from below the impact floors; almost everyone above the impact floors perished, either from the impact and fire or from the subsequent collapse. The structures of the buildings were heroic in some ways but less so in others. The buildings survived the impact of the Boeing 767 aircraft, an impact very much greater than had been contemplated in our design (a slow-flying Boeing 707 lost in the fog and seeking a landing field). Therefore, the robustness of the towers was exemplary. At the same time, the fires raging in the inner reaches of the buildings undermined their strength. In time, the unimaginable happened... wounded by the impact of the aircraft and bleeding from the fires, both of the towers of the World Trade Center collapsed."

Oops; the chief engineer on the WTC said slow speed! Gee, as a pilot, an instructor pilot, and an engineer, I have no problem with a slow speed impact being the most likely accident to happen to the WTC. You see, it is a fact! Why do you think a plane would be doing 600 mph in an accident? You have no clue do you? Zip?

And as an engineer, I know the 187 pounds of TNT impact of a slow speed 707 would not do significant damabe to the core and people could leave the building even in a fire on that side of the impact, and the fire control would survive. But at 600 mph, even Robertson, like me, could calculate the 2200 pounds on of TNT KE impact would damage the core big time! Even a kid in a physics class with some initial conditions could figure this out; do you think Robertson could?! He was the Chief Structural Engineer on the WTC! You seem to be lacking knowledge on this! You should have read his paper.

If you think I am wrong please provide some numbers why Robertson is wrong! I supplied numbers but I bet you missed them!

The first graders said look here!  http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf/weblinks/CGOZ-58NLCB 

Or they said his paper could help!  http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf/weblinks/NAEW-63AS9S?OpenDocument  Now you have to look for the paper here! The first graders doubt you could find it; I said you could if you tried; Be positive kids.

But then here is the pdf file and they said include this incase you are not able to figure it out! Kids?  http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf...df?OpenElement 

They said to remind you the 600 mph stuff was not sources at all. They were doing the "Itsy bitsy spider story", and were very current on cause and effect.

 
Did you even do the energy? Why not? Physics! Next time take the hard courses like President Kennedy advised!

 
not only because they are easy, but because they are hard,
September 12, 1962, JFK

 
Next time take physics; you will be proud to have knowledge.

Yep, if you guys would do the hard stuff, you would not be 9/11 truth members who make up false information and fail to use logic, rational thought, and skip knowledge to formulate even simple statements. Too easy to debunk. Failure.
 
 
My own personal speculation is that during the war of the press releases, someone who thought they were clever decided to weasel-word a document with some phrase similar to: "shown to withstand collision from a 600 mph aircraft". The 707 was a 600 mph aircraft in terms of top speed, even parked. Someone less clever later edited the weasel-wording into an actual lie, probably thinking it was just an awkward sentence construction.
 
 
 
Why would an aircraft be coming in to land at 600mph? Surely an error about the speed has crept in somewhere. Anyway, this has come up before; the 600mph figure was mentioned in a 1964  NYT article  :

 

Same source :

 
The center's architects, in a statement yesterday, denied that the towers would be unsafe in the event of an explosion or an airplane crash. The realty men had questioned the safety of the project's construction.

 
 
 
Ah, so the towers would be safe in the event of an explosion. I guess that means any explosions right? So if the sun exploded, we all head to the towers and live?
 
 
 
Same source :

 
and im sure the designers of the titanic denied it would unsafe in the event of colliding with an iceberg
 
 
 
Ah, so the towers would be safe in the event of an explosion.

 
It's true. TC329 has just ruled out CD in the WTC.

ans stil robertson has nothing that would backup that slow speed. his claims directly contradict the claims of the 600 MPH. just his credibility as chief engineer isnt enough.

I'm note sure your age or background, so forgive me if you know this.

What those relying on Robertson's quote to support post-crash survivability are doing is indulging in speculation. There are no calculations available to be checked. We don't know for sure how much they took account of speed, of size, of fuel. We don't know the modelling system.

Until these calculations are produced, and can be verified, then from a logical and indeed procedural perspective then we have no choice other than to set them at naught, to put the information to the side.

It's a bit like Heiwa's claims about structural performance. He can't actually psot any meanginful structural calculations, so even if he is right - which, let's face it, is unlikely - then how would we know?
 
 
The answer is perfectly clear here. A manual calculation was done on paper, but nobody can determine for certain what airplane speed was used in the calculation because it was done over 40 years ago and the calculation itself cannot be found. Robertson, who actually carried out the calculation, is more likely to be right than subsequent events that are derived from Robertson as a source, but ultimately we don't know for certain and never will. But Robertson's credibility doesn't rest on his status as chief engineer, rather on the fact that his is the only first-hand testimony as to the contents of the calculation, and all other testimony is derived from his.

Since the calculation was not a part of the design specification or process of the towers but was carried out retrospectively to counter a politically motivated objection to their construction, and since the computational power available at the time was grossly inadequate to model the effects of the impact in any detail, the practical implications of this entire issue are negligible.

computer power here computer power there, imagen there was a time without computers  

sure those calculations from the 60's cannot be in such detail and accuracy like we have it today, when almost everyone is able to do some sinple FEA sims on his home computer.
today calculations about something complex like that would fill alot more than just 1200 pages.

i dont know did Robertson himself calculate on that analysis?

You total lack of knowledge is unlimited on this subject. I am cheating my parents made me become and engineer and I am a pilot who has flown 300,000 pound Jet aircraft for a living. So, the fact Robertson is the CHIEF engineer on the WTC does mean your ideas on this subject are total bs. Robertson was in charge; which part of chief do you not understand?

The impact study was low speed and is supported by all the other people who are mentioned. Demartini - yes, multiple 707 could impact at low speed and WTC survives, you can calculate it if you had some engineering in your CT mind. If Demartini said 600 mph he was wrong; but a dumb reporter who failed to understand the design point would/could look up 600 mph at the Boeing web site and add it later in ERROR.

Skilling, gee, he never said 600 mph, the reporters and other idiots added the 600 mph, go check it out; Only a researched challenged ppl can not figure out simple stuff like this?

The fact is a slow speed impact does not globally affect the building, whereas a high speed impact does.

Low speed is the KE of 187 pounds of TNT
High speed is the KE of 2200 pounds of TNT

Even a high school student with guidance for the physics teacher can figure this our, why are you not able to?

So on 9/11 we have for a FACT, the impacts were 7 to 11 times greater in energy than the design of the aircraft impact the WTC was to survive! FACT

You are bringing up fictions stuff, it has been pointed out and you failed to learn a thing or debate the real facts; why?
If you choose to follow the idiots who post stuff at PrisonPlanet and pass along lies and real dumb stuff; you have succeeded. Notice you never offered up numbers to dispute me, or explain how the WTC would survive an impact of 2200 pounds of TNT KE impact! Got Physics?

Doubt you will answer any of the many questions; nor come up with some numbers to prove your failed point.

the point is that both side just claim theyr claim is the truth. while in reality no side knows for sure. and thats with many of the things about 9/11 the same.

ETA Don't forget the "truth" movement dragged this out as proof of something.
 
 
 
The empirical evidence corroborates Skilling's claim. I don't see how anyone could be dumb enough to argue with empirical evidence.

 
Skilling never said 600 mph; so you go with the chief engineer on the slow speed lost in the fog most likely aircraft accident event.

Top speed on the airspeed indicator is 350 KIAS, no pilots would exceed the imposed limits or the speed limit of 250 KIAS, or exceed the airport traffic speed! The problem with 9/11 truth is their inability to use logic and think for themselves, they have already made up their minds without evidence; that is called failure. So slow speed impact is not possible for the people who want to make up false information, this 600 mph junk fits into their twisted view of the world, so they spew it without checking the facts.

lol

just cause someone is chief does not make him right. not even in the army....

Frank A. DeMartini sayd slow flying? the guy that belived that the wtc could take several impacts of a fully loaded 707? and says its like a pencil in a mosquitonetting?i only know that interview with him, dunno where did he say or write slow flying?

 http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGInaB0eQM 

Skilling? did you research what he sayd? if so, why dont you mention this quote from skilling?

 http://archives.seattletimes.nwsourc...&date=19930227 

 
Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed," he said. "The building structure would still be there.

Skilling - a recognized expert in tall buildings - doesn't think a single 200-pound car bomb would topple or do major structural damage to a Trade Center tower. The supporting columns are closely spaced and even if several were disabled, the others would carry the load.

"However," he added, "I'm not saying that properly applied explosives - shaped explosives - of that magnitude could not do a tremendous amount of damage."

 
Fires?`what sayd Robertson about Fires? he cannot recal if fires was considered......

there goes your strawman.
its not sure that they took slow speed or 600 MPH, i tend to 600 MPH, especially when you see how they withstood the impacts of 2 planes larger than a 707 and NOT slowflying.

oc the impact at slower speed would for the building be alot less damage.

your FACT is not a FACT, thats a FACT
but also my belive in the 600 MPH is a NOT a fact

i bring up stuff that has already been pointed out, and i learned, not what you would like, but i did  

yes i had physics, not on a level like Newton Bits, or Dr. Greenings, Dr, Bazant
but i had physics, had more to do with compressed gasses and mechanical less structural. but that doesnt mather in this topic, caues we are both just speculating, but you call your speculating FACT.

you offer talk; I give you first hand source of a design by the chief engineer (the guy in charge of building the WTC, he signed the stuff) that says slow speed, he even did a paper showing 180 mph. And you offer hearsay rant with zip for sources!

I have first hand source! You have hearsay, even from NIST! Funny how you lost and you are still fighting for your failed point. What was it?

SPAM away with the hearsay, maybe on day you will gather a fact instead of failed ideas from 9/11 truth.

I showed you the paper and you failed to even study the stuff I present after I took all the stuff you presented and read it and found it to be hearsay junk spewed by idiots from 9/11 truth and hearsay inserted into a NIST report! Yet finding 11, if you read it supports only a slow speed impact; YES, finding 11 is true except for the impact speed! Finally a reason to be an engineer, or a lay person who can think for themselves. Read finding 11 and you will see it supports only the low speed impact, not a 600 mph hearsay speed.

If you are going to even try to support hearsay, you need to read the real stuff first and then try to present your hearsay versus real first hand sources.

You will not find a real first hand source for 600 mph from someone who worked on the WTC. The 600 mph was inserted by someone else, not the team that built the WTC.

If you would read the stuff I present, you will see 180 mph, but you have to read it.

Research seems to be the biggest problem for 9/11 truth, and why they fail to gain knowledge on 9/11.

Calling Robertson a liar without evidence. Calling Robertson a liar with hearsay. 9/11 truth is so pathetic, they make up stuff to sell DVD filled with implication of false conclusions. Go buy some lies from 9/11 truth; they are for free on the internet.

You are not really reading posts, you missed my source, it is a pdf file! looks like you prefer hearsay, why read when 9/11 truth presents all the implied false conclusion you will ever need.

Most of 9/11 truth is failure to understand and research; otherwise there would be no 9/11 truth if they actually valued knowledge over hearsay junk.

 http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf...df?OpenElement 

Why believe the real chief engineer, when you have all those expert 9/11 truth guys!?
So, you want to call Robertson a liar? Seems his building did good to stand up to an impact 7 to 11 times the design! I would call it outstanding!

What does this bs have to do with 19 Islamic terrorist killing Americans? The only thing 9/11 truth is good at is to show how a few people who lack knowledge on many topics related to 9/11 can make up stupid stories and false conclusions.

for you hearsay is king, but then you seem to like 9/11 truth false ideas

where did John Skilling say 600 mph?
 
 
 
typing pls instead of please doesnt really seem like a language issue

 
its more the case of faster typing  
but why dont you go deeper into Skilling's quote, rather than debating my spelling, if you want we can do both.

Fires?`what sayd Robertson about Fires? he cannot recal if fires was considered......

That's not actually what he said.

 
It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark. To the best of our knowledge, little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft, and no designs were prepared for that circumstance. Indeed, at that time, no fireproofing systems were available to control the effects of such fires.

 
From:  http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf...ks/CGOZ-58NLCB  which has already been linked at least twice in this very thread. It's good reading on its own, but if you would like to have images to look at as well try beachnut's version.

As others have pointed out, we don't have access to the calculations themselves, and we can't verify what the underlying assumptions were or how the figures might have been simplified. We no longer have access to Skilling or DeMartini for their take on the matter. But in any case, even if we did, in the absence of any calculations, it's my opinion that as the lead structural engineer, Robertson's account as to what they did or did not consider would be the most credible of the three.
 
 
Bottom line is this:

Civilian passenger jets do not fly 600 miles per hour at 1,000 feet during normal operations. Does not happen.

So why on earth would engineers and architects purposely design a building to survive an incident which is far beyond what the building could reasonably be expected to encounter during its lifetime?
 
 
Our clients would be almost as pissed at us as they would be if we specified a whole bunch of fire resistant insullation they didn't need.
 
 
 
Quit pickin' on Lisa like that.

during normal operations planes also dont hit buildings, no mather what speed.

im sure you belive every word that the CHIEF investigator from NIST WTC Investigations says.

Go get flight sim from microsoft, the top speed on the airspeed indicator at 1000 feet is not near 600 mph.

The point is there are no rational accidents scenarios where a 707 would be going 600 mph at the WTC! He was correct, you are making wild guesses and false ideas of woo about 9/11. You need to get help from pilots that are not in the 9/11 truth movement of false ideas.

no i dont need help from pilots in that mather.

just explain me, why you think NIST Finfing 11 only supports the slow flying plane? it does not say that, it say that there is no documentary evidence.

but that also goes for the slowflying plane, they also have no evidence of that.

and where exactly did Robertson show papers showing those 180 MPH?

why do you have such a hard time to accept that no side has evidence,
no evidence for 600 MPH no evidence for 180 MPH.

just your fantasy makes this 180 MPH reality.

Not hearsay, not third person junk added to fill in an article. But first person information, the person responsible for WTC towers going up.
 http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf/weblinks/NAEW-63AS9S/$FILE/Bridge-v32n1.pdf?OpenElement 

 
The two towers were the first structures outside of the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airliner, the Boeing 707. It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark. To the best of our knowledge, little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft, and no designs were prepared for that circumstance. Indeed, at that time, no fireproofing systems were available to control the effects of such fires.

 
These are the facts behind the 707 impact design and it fits the narratives presented by all those involved. Even NIST includes this in 1-2, if someone would read further! Sounds like 9/11 truth can not handle history, and pick the correct evidence before making up fantasy conclusions based on errors and incomplete research.

Facts not hearsay.

In finding 11 the only thing wrong is the speed. Sorry, but the local damage is only possible in a slow speed impact of about 187 pounds of TNT KE impact. The impact of a 707 at 600 mph would be an event 14 times larger at 2600 pounds of TNT impact. The author of the OP will not be able to check these numbers; why?

Therefore NIST finding 11 as it pertains to the OP (see past posts), is correct except for the speed. That is a fact as presented and corrected by the source who built the WTC; Questions?

Facts not hearsay. 9/11 truth is hearsay junk. (NIST does present the 180 mph design point! Did you not read NIST yet? Your lack of knowledge and lack of research is showing)

LOL you lack knowledge about 9/11.

the planes did cause local damage at impact.

you have a hard time thinking for your self. was you for a long time in the army? are you used to folow orders and not question them?
 
 
so interviews with robertson are firsthand, but interviews with skilling are now hearsay? you brought up skilling, not me, but then you learned what he really sayd, now he isnt credible anymore......

yeah cherry picker
 
 
btw mr. 9/11knowledge beachnut

where did DeMartini say low speed or slow flying?

you claimed that he sayd that, can you pls link me to that?
 
 
I see Dick has neglected my post. Oh well. Do what you can to maintain your fantasy.
 
 
 
LOL you lack knowledge about 9/11.

you have a hard time thinking for your self. was you for a long time in the army? are you used to folow orders and not question them?

 
Sorry, you lack the knowledge you did not even finish reading NIST to see 180 mph was mentioned. OOPS 1

The planes caused damage to the core! OOPS 2, that is not local that is global in nature and kept the people trapped above! That is not what finding 11 alluded to. OOPS 3, your out!

OH, I was a pilot, an instructor pilot, a flight commander, a chief instructor pilot, an operations officer, the chief of safety, I am an engineer, I ran a laboratory, and as such my thinking for myself was more than enough to get me in trouble with those like you who think someone should blindly follow orders. OOPS 4, I not only strived to think for myself, it was necessary for me to think for myself if my plane or mission was to be successful. This is why the American fighting men and women are unique; they cherish above all the individual who can think for themsleves even when in a team! Therefore, if someone takes out our generals, or captains, many of us rise up to fill the leadership void and win! We all think for ourselves unless we join groups like 9/11 truth, then we suspend rational thought and take on a groupthink like you seem to do. OOPS 5.

Your analysis of me is as poor as your knowledge on 9/11; I am not the greatest think for yourself person, I am one of millions. Only 9/11 truth seems to have problems thinking for themselves; they love hearsay. I like to find the first hand quotes, unlike you.

Like Skilling never said 600 mph! You failed to show it from his mouth, or in his work! OOPS 6, out 2. (please do not use the wise little bugger stuff again)
 
 
 
Our clients would be almost as pissed at us as they would be if we specified a whole bunch of fire resistant insullation they didn't need.

 
this one?

so the 600 MPH claim was totaly wrong? or insered by the press?
what would backup that claim?
its possible. but is there evidence?
 
 
There's no evidence for your claim. This is a skeptic's board, mind you.
 
 
 
Sorry, you lack the knowledge you did not even finish reading NIST to see 180 mph was mentioned. OOPS 1

The planes caused damage to the core! OOPS 2, that is not local that is global in nature and kept the people trapped above! That is not what finding 11 alluded to. OOPS 3, your out!

OH, I was a pilot, an instructor pilot, a flight commander, a chief instructor pilot, an operations officer, the chief of safety, I am an engineer, I ran a laboratory, and as such my thinking for myself was more than enough to get me in trouble with those like you who think someone should blindly follow orders. OOPS 4, I not only strived to think for myself, it was necessary for me to think for myself if my plane or mission was to be successful. This is why the American fighting men and women are unique; they cherish above all the individual who can think for themsleves even when in a team! Therefore, if someone takes out our generals, or captains, many of us rise up to fill the leadership void and win! We all think for ourselves unless we join groups like 9/11 truth, then we suspend rational thought and take on a groupthink like you seem to do. OOPS 5.

Your analysis of me is as poor as your knowledge on 9/11; I am not the greatest think for yourself person, I am one of millions. Only 9/11 truth seems to have problems thinking for themselves; they love hearsay. I like to find the first hand quotes, unlike you.

just link me to the document and give me the page number.

and pls show me the DeMartini interview where he sayd SLOW FLYING.

cmon, just backup your claims, it is not that hard.

just backup your claims about DeMartini or admit you was wrong.

also superpilot/engineers can be wrong   and im pretty sure you are wrong. proof the contrary, show me DeMartini interview where he talks about SLOW flying. pls
 
 
 
There's no evidence for your claim. This is a skeptic's board, mind you.

 
read my posts, i several times sayd there is no evidence, its Beachnut that has trouble accepting it.

i know no side has evidence, but ppl like beachnut have a hard time accepting it   not very sceptic that guy.

btw mr. 9/11knowledge beachnut

where did DeMartini say low speed or slow flying?

you claimed that he sayd that, can you pls link me to that?

 
You are sounding like jdx now! Are you really lacking this much knowledge on 9/11 so you have to jump on all my words? Give me a break.

DeMartini said the WTC towers could take multiple hits from a 707! I agree if the planes are going below 200 mph!

Next? Knowledge is king; facts not hearsay.

DeMartini said
 
"the building was designed to have a fully loaded Boeing 707 crash into it."

 
, he was wrong, it was a low fuel 707, not fully loaded. (DeMartini did not build the WTC, and where did he mention 600 mph?)
If there had been a 180 mph impact, the towers could take multiple hits. I agree. But it was not in the design to have a fully loaded 707 impact. Are you unable to read and understand what Robertson said. Then if you read the NIST findings and other work you can see that the 180 mph impact was what the design for survival was about. If you need help please ask, otherwise you can go on repeating the hearsay junk of 9/11 truth and try to ignore facts and evidence you can even find in NIST if you use your head and logical thinking.

600 mph is not local damage it is global damage, see 9/11. See the reports about the impacts. Robertson is the evidence, it is also presented in NIST, you must read a lot of NIST before cherry picking the things that confuse you.

If you are saying there was a design done at 600 mph showing the buildings would survive, you are wrong and you have no evidence. The 600 mph in NIST, and in the news sources is not sourced to evidence, there is no paper you can produce, there are no quotes from the builders of the WTC to say 600 mph impact will have the WTC towers survive. But there is evidence for the slow speed impact if you are able to understand energy, even if you have a hard time understanding a direct quote from Robertson saying 180 mph (written in HIS PAPER) and he says slow speed (written in HIS paper).

There are only first hand quotes and papers showing the speed was slow, and the damage would be local which fits perfectly with a slow speed impact. You need to read and comprehend the narratives and try to understand the 600 mph is a mistake by people who did not build the WTC. Skilling never mentions 600 mph, but he does talk about things that support the slow speed study done by Robertson's team who built the WTC. Robertson then comes out and tells you, and me the design for a surviving WTC tower was a slow speed, lost in the fog aircraft. This evidence shows the hearsay 600 mph statements are not correct. The only thing about a large impact is the building will not topple over at the speeds of impacts on 9/11; if there was study of that and the vibrations, then 600 mph would not topple them. See 9/11.

If you would just take the speeds and do some physics you can see why the WTC damage was severe on 9/11 and the towers fell. But since you have not presented numbers to support your hearsay, I have to assume you will not take the time to understand the energy involved on 9/11.

 http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf...df?OpenElement 

have you failed to read Robertson's paper? Please read Robertson's paper. Frank DeMartini does not know what the design of the WTC was first hand, his quotes are hearsay. Robertson's quotes are not hearsay, they are facts and evidence you and 9/11 truth will twist to fit your version of reality, that is called fantasy and lies.

oh now DeMartini is wrong cause he does not support your belive lol.

you got evidence that he and skilling are wrong, and Robertson was right?

you think slow flying is fact? based on what evidence pls?

Robertson is the chief engineer on the WTC, DeMartini was not. DeMartini did not build the WTC, Robertson did.
Guess you have not read Robertson's paper which proves the impact design was slow speed. You are hung up on DeMartini who did not even build the WTC structure or do the study that Robertson had done for Robertson's building; the WTC.

we tal here about the analysis of a 707 impacting the WTC with 180 MPH or 600 MPH. its about 180 or 600. not who is behind 9/11.

My appologies. DNA evidence has nothing to do with this. However, it does have a lot to do with, you know, 9/11.
 
 
What relevance does the impact analysis done on the WTC have to anything at all?

nothing  

the point is something completly diffrent, and beachnut is demonstrating it perfectly.
 
 
But DC, without the calcualtions it's academic. We don't know their basis, hence we can't draw any conclusions other than take on board Robertson's comments as the only first-hand source.
 
 
 
The empirical evidence corroborates Skilling's claim. I don't see how anyone could be dumb enough to argue with empirical evidence.

 
The empirical evidence suggests that, absent the fuel fire, the Twin Towers would probably have withstood the impact of a 707 at 600mph, at least long enough for evacuation. It doesn't in any way corroborate Skilling's claim that a calculation was carried out that led to such a conclusion.

Just to get this straight... you believe that the 600 MPH figure was used but can't prove it, and that's okay with you. beachnut believes that the 180 MPH figure was used and can't prove it, and you're all over him because of it?

Why do you think the "truth" movement brought up and harped on this point in the first place?
 
 
 
during normal operations planes also dont hit buildings, no mather what speed.

 
Yes, but the only feasible way for an airliner to crash into the buildings at a 90-degree angle AND at 600-mph would be if it were piloted into it deliberately.

This would have been unthinkable to the designers. Back in the 60's, it would have sounded like something out of a bad James Bond movie.

You do not understand energy, so you can not understand the difference between 600 mph and 180 mph.

 
Robertson's work from his paper on his design. See the 290 km/hr, that is 180 mph. OOPs, 180.187 mph.

So you are not able to produce a single paper with 600 mph study, nor a direct quote from Robertson or Skilling which has 600 mph in it. Just some people who put in 600 mph due to the fact the Boeing page for a 707 list 607 mph as the cruise speed. Wowzer, and kind of sad that all of 9/11 truth ignores evidence and falls for errors. I mean you even use NIST (no truther would use NIST, they all say NIST is wrong or something) to say 600 mph, when NIST even says 180 mph! Which one do you use? Oh noes, you have to think for yourself, and you said I dont think for myself, but I do, so you are wrong all the time, or what? You have to use knowledge and judegement to come up with the real evidence. So I used the chief structural engineer of the WTC who was in charge. Who do you use to come up with your hearsay not supported by facts or evidence?

Robertson wrote this down! He was the chief structural engineer on the WTC. Please try to match the level of expert to this criteria before you present anymore hearsay.

 
The structures of the buildings were heroic in some ways but less so in others. The buildings survived the impact of the Boeing 767 aircraft, an impact very much greater than had been contemplated in our design (a slow-flying Boeing 707 lost in the fog and seeking a landing field). Therefore, the robustness of the towers was exemplary. At the same time, the fires raging in the inner reaches of the buildings undermined their strength. In time, the unimaginable happened... wounded by the impact of the aircraft and bleeding from the fires, both of the towers of the World Trade Center collapsed.

 
Robertson said "slow-flying Boeing 707". In his paper.

 
The two towers were the first structures outside of the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airliner, the Boeing 707. It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark.

 

Robertson said a plane lost in the fog seeking to land. I am a pilot, and have over 4,000 hours in a large (300,000 pound class) jet aircraft, we prefer to land below 180 mph, never at 600 mph, we do not want to die! Robertson got his landing speed very close at 180 mph! Look, he even presents a graph with 180 mph disguised in km/hr.

 

From Robertson's paper, if you convert the km/hr to mph, you get 180 mph, from the guy who built the WTC towers; the chief structural engineer. You got hearsay, I have the real evidence. Why?

From NIST!

 
Report indicated that it was assumed in the 1960s design of the WTC towers that a Boeing 707 aircraft, lost in the fog and seeking to land at a nearby airport, might strike the towers while low on fuel and at a landing speed of 180 mph.

 

NIST does mention the 180 mph, and I have backed it up with first hand evidence from Robertson the one who was responsible for the study design impact. We have taken the hearsay from NIST and backed it up with evidence to form some facts.

Here NIST talks about the study and how Robertson (by reference to the structural designers, that is Robertson) said the towers would survive. And as you see on 9/11 since the impacts were 7 to 11 times bigger than the design of a slow speed impact the following things they talk about can not happen in a high speed impact.

 
 risk assessment report,, identified the scenario of an aircraft striking a tower as one of the maximum foreseeable losses.  "This scenario is within the realm of the possible, but highly unlikely. In the event such an unlikely occurrence, what might result? The structural designers of the towers have publicly stated that in their opinion that either of the Towers could withstand such an impact from a large modern passenger aircraft. The ensuing fire would damage the skin in this scenario, and the spilled fuel would fall to the Plaza level where it would have to be extinguished by the NYC Fire Department.

 

In a low speed impact the things discussed in the selection from NIST can happen. But in a high speed impact major damage is done to the core, damaging the fire control systems, and the fuel is injected into the WTC to start major fires which will destroy the WTC. So on 9/11 there was no a lot of fuel that made it to the Plaza, so high speed impacts could not be what the survivable design was for.  http://www.boeing.com/commercial/707family/product.html  So some people must of gone to the Boeing page, and posted the cruise speed out of ignorance.

Some please explain this stuff so he can understand. Or read him what Robertson wrote. Or tell him this is not a one paragraph, I am done kind of understanding.  http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf...df?OpenElement 

Why is the guy who built the WTC not the correct source for this?

Pilot: Oh, no, we're lost! What do we do?

Co-pilot: How should I know? Ask the flight attendant.

Flight attendant: I don't know, uh...try tripling your speed?

Co-pilot: Hey, good idea!

Pilot: What could it hurt?

Once again, I'll refer you to this document:

 http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm 

This quote:

 
As stated in Section 5.3.2 of NIST NCSTAR 1, a document from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) indicated that the impact of a [single, not multiple] Boeing 707 aircraft was analyzed during the design stage of the WTC towers. However, NIST investigators were unable to locate any documentation of the criteria and method used in the impact analysis and, therefore, were unable to verify the assertion that “… such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building.…”

 
If you're not going to read the entire NIST report, you could at least read the FAQ. It's quite short. NIST does not support your claims.

NIST did not say 600 mph, they posted things they found.

Robertson is right, he built the WTC and was responsible for the structural design. There are not other sources that are first hand, or better than Robertson. Please correct me if you can. Who built the WTC? Questions?

Robertson has backed up his claim in papers and talks all over the world. You could ask him yourself.

I have presented multiple times the paper Robertson did in a real journal, a respected Journal, and you fail to see Robertson supports the slow speed impact study. Why?

NIST never used 600 mph. NIST said someone else said 600 mph. Your failure to understand this point becomes a clear sign you can not learn.

Robertson's design details a slow speed impact. The damage talked about in all the sources we have discussed implies a slow speed impact and I have tried to state the logic behind that.

You keep saying NIST said 600 mph, but they did not say the study was at 600 mph, the reported what others said, and those other sources are not the chief stuctual engineer of the WTC.

Yes, I am saying the 600 mph used by other sources is in error when they talk about local damage and no deaths away from the impact point. Only a slow speed impact design can account for the statements that go with the 600 mph error, and Robertson is the single top source on this. You must call him a liar if you want to use your 600 mph error for local damage only impact. The 600 mph error is not NIST's error, it is the source's error. NIST did no 600 mph study to see if the WTC would suffer local only damage. They are reporting what others said, not did.

If you read and understand NIST, they never said the 600 mph was used and confirmed, they repeat that in the FACTS they post on their web site that so many have pointed out.

This is not big deal to NIST, their references in the 1-2 report are historical and give back ground. Robertson is telling you how they did it. You are ignoring facts and evidence and making up junk about 9/11 without using logic and reason.

Robertson is right, he built the WTC and was responsible for the structural design. There are not other sources that are first hand, or better than Robertson. Please correct me if you can. Who built the WTC? Questions?

Robertson has backed up his claim in papers and talks all over the world. You could ask him yourself.

I have presented multiple times the paper Robertson did in a real journal, a respected Journal, and you fail to see Robertson supports the slow speed impact study. Why?

 http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf...df?OpenElement 

NIST never used 600 mph. NIST said someone else said 600 mph. Your failure to understand this point becomes a clear sign you can not learn.

Robertson's design details a slow speed impact. The damage talked about in all the sources we have discussed implies a slow speed impact and I have tried to state the logic behind that.

You keep saying NIST said 600 mph, but they did not say the study was at 600 mph, the reported what others said, and those other sources are not the chief stuctual engineer of the WTC.

Yes, I am saying the 600 mph used by other sources is in error when they talk about local damage and no deaths away from the impact point. Only a slow speed impact design can account for the statements that go with the 600 mph error, and Robertson is the single top source on this. You must call him a liar if you want to use your 600 mph error for local damage only impact. The 600 mph error is not NIST's error, it is the source's error. NIST did no 600 mph study to see if the WTC would suffer local only damage. They are reporting what others said, not did.

If you read and understand NIST, they never said the 600 mph was used and confirmed, they repeat that in the FACTS they post on their web site that so many have pointed out.

This is not big deal to NIST, their references in the 1-2 report are historical and give back ground. Robertson is telling you how they did it. You are ignoring facts and evidence and making up junk about 9/11 without using logic and reason.

 
and NIST als never uses that 180 MPH, they just say FEMA found out  

but NIST is honest, they dont claim its that nor that, cause they cannot back it up with the calculations.

and when i read about Skillings interviews i think the man remembers alot more than robertson.

but sure, one can trust on Robertson's word. i dont. cause its not a fact, in fact we dont know what speed they used.

It is now. 290 km/hr = 180.197 mph

DC, on Page 5 NIST talks about the difficulties faced with modeling the aircraft impact and damage. This is with modern technology! Do you really think it was possible that anyone was able to model an aircraft striking the towers in 1964?

Cute signature.

 
"NIST 1-2 page 4 talks about damage only a slow speed accident could cause but in error use 600 mph."

beachnut

 
NIST did not do the study, they report that PANYNJ has a paper that say:

 
"… The Buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707 – DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not couase collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact."

 

I am saying either the 600 mph is in error, or the guys who made the complete statement are nuts! So is the speed in error, or are these people idiots? Because a 600 mph impact is equal to 2600 pounds of TNT and that is twice as much energy Flight 11 delivered to the WTC, and the damage was GLOBAL not local. Do you understand physics?

So you are trying to say the 600 mph is correct when the result would be twice as much damage as flight 11 and 30 percent more damage than flight 175! That is not local damage, it is worse than 9/11 damage. Did you even run the numbers for KE on a 600 mph, fully loaded 707? I did and the 600 mph figure is in error, or the people who said it are total idiots, no engineer helped them with that 600 mph fantasy figure resulting in local damage.

keep your signature, an example of anti-intellectual, 9/11 truth false information.

 http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf...df?OpenElement 

I guess it could take an engineering degree to understand NIST, and Robertson. So when will you be finished with your degree? Got physics?

did you take a look how many elements they used for the FE model of that Boeing? thats extreem, only the turbines. every single seat was modeled.

in no way something like that was possible in the 60's

but already in the 60's they could do amazing things. look at the WTC  
and i do belvie that they already had alot knowledge to do some "rough" calculations.
I dont think they used computers, i think would they have done that, they would have mentioned it. they do mention 1200 pages.

and when you take a look at how amazingly the towers took the impacts of 2, even larger than estimated, planes.

im totaly convinced that Skilling and co used 600 MPH, because the impact caused only local damage, and like Skilling says, the fires would be the biggest problem. and indeed.

ok Skilling assumed that the steel structure would survive the fires, that did not happen. but was office fires in the 60's already as hot as today? i dont know but i assume todays office fires are alot hotter do to more Plastic used in offices today.

Do you realize that you use extremly simplyfied "calculation" of that impact energy?
 
 
 
btw i would also like to see a backup to the claim, that Robertson was involved in that Analysis.

 

 
 
 
 
can you show me the calculations?

 
Take the strength of steel used on the exterior of the WTC. Take the KE of the impacts. You can do some simple calculations to see how much the columns are damaged. The exterior is very strong. Now the impact energy of 11 and 175, and a 600 mph 707 all come close to enough energy to cut all the columns on WTC floor. But the plane is not in the shape of a 300,000 pound 600 mph knife. So you can take the impact energy per unit area and the strength of the steel as Robertson did and caculate what kind of damage would be done.

Now tell me why I should do a calculation for you that is worth over 10,000 dollars. Are you going to pay me for my time, or should I go work on my hobbies?

Most people could take the impact KE values and get a good idea that 187 pounds of TNT KE impact, would only do local damage, and Flight 11, Flight 175 and a 600 mph 707 would do massive damage.

 
If you call this local damage, I see your problem. This was a 2200 pounds of TNT impact, a 600 mph 707 would be bigger at 2600 pounds!

For example a slow speed impact is 187 pounds of TNT in KE (kinetic energy)

Flight 11 was 1300 pounds of TNT impact.

Flight 175 was 2200 pounds of TNT impact KE

A 707 lost in the fog would be 187 pounds of TNT KE

A 707 at 600 mph would be 2600 pounds of TNT KE

With just a brain you can see the 187 pounds of TNT KE impact would only breach the wall and a lot of the plane would fall to the ground. But a 2600 pounds of TNT KE impact would enter the building and damage more core columns that the planes of 9/11. That is not local damage, and more than just those next to the impact would be killed in just.2 seconds.

Just using logic you can see. But you have to do it with your own brain, it is called thinking for yourself which you said I do not! Gee, it seem my pointing out the 600 mph error is an example of just one person thinking for themselves.

I would rather be the only one what sees 600 mph is in error, you seem happy to be repeating the errors of 9/11 truth. Who is thinking for themselves? So for 10,000 bucks I will give you an impact study; who wants to help?

 http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf/weblinks/NAEW-63AS9S/$FILE/Bridge-v32n1.pdf?OpenElement  yes this is the paper, in a journal, the same paper I have given to the OP author many times, but here for quick reference, is Robertson's paper for those who have time, or wish to read it without searching again. A paper which the op author has not found fault yet.

I think the photo is proof a high speed impact does more than local damage; therefore reference to a study which says local damage only, and 600 mph, are not compatible, therefore are in error.
 
 
I have only read the first page of this thread.
However has anyone questioned whether or not a 707 could even do 600 MPH at 1000 ASL? If it could not, then this goes beyond the 'worst case senario' and becomes a ridiculous senario that was pushed by the PANYNJ and not by any engineer.

why on earth should i do such simplyfied calculations?
NIST has done some very complex FE sims.

very detailed, i think pretty accurate. (prolly only doubted by No planers)

 http://wtc.nist.gov/video/WTC_engine1.ram 
 http://wtc.nist.gov/video/WTC_engine2.ram 

my SolidWorks FE sims will never beat that lol  
 
 
 
Do you realize that you use extremly simplyfied "calculation" of that impact energy?

 
No I used exact impact energy at impact, you do not understand physics.

Flight 11 2,840,000,000 joules impact energy
Flight 175, 4,380,000,000 joules impact energy
A 707 at 600 mph fully loaded, 5,480,000,000 joules impact energy
The real design study impact was 386,000,000 joules impact energy
Not simple, they are real. Real impact energy!

 
Flight 175, 4,380,000,000 joules impact energy - this is what a 4,380,000,000 joule impact looks like with jet fuel. Not simplified; just physics.

how big is the area this kinetic energy is "applied" to?

See, the people who wrote the paper did what you did, they blindly use a number they do not even understand.

You have proven my point. BTW, a 707 at 1000 feet was limited to 355 KCAS, since the skin starts to peel off above that speed and would led to sever damage and destruction if repeated, or done for long periods.

So 607 mph is not a good speed for 1000 feet, but people who lack knowledge use it to make up junk about 9/11.

 
This is the area the KE is applied to, the WTC. You can see details in NIST. Oh, you already have. You can also get the cross sectional areas on the planes at Boeing.

wrong  

you really are an engineer? :/

how big is the area of the nose and how big is the area of the steel beams hit by that nose?

that is the moment the impact starts   the moment the kinetic energy of this moving mass is started to beeing "applied" to the tower fasade.

like i sayd, you use very simplyfied physics.
 
 
 
At what altitude was that?

 
as it is cruising speed, i would say it is on cruising altitude.

will this lead us to the speed of AA77?
 
 
 
I have only read the first page of this thread.
However has anyone questioned whether or not a 707 could even do 600 MPH at 1000 ASL?

 
what was it the truthers were saying about f77s ability to go 400-some mph at low altitude? lol

anyway, im going to go back to something i said very early in this thread, i think we (either side) needs to show conclusively that any consideration of airliner impact was done AT ALL as part of the design phase, before debating the assumptions of those calculations, so far its all people saying "i think it was this speed" "i think it was that speed" with none of them able to provide any documentation that it was ANY speed
 
 
 
as it is cruising speed, i would say it is on cruising altitude.

 
Do you think 1,000 feet is cruising altitude?

Please tell me which impact energy was not correct?

Your posts are now off topic and fail to support your failed OP

I should wrap it up and say once again, Robertson clearly supports the slow-flying impact design study. All can see in this paper it is discussed.  http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf...df?OpenElement 

And this single diagram helps understand the energy and the 180 mph is shown.
 
So you have all the answers to your OP. But your derail is noted, it was your OP, guess you can derail it more. But seems I have repeated the answer to the OP too many times.

You should start a new thread for your physics lesson; bring money.
 
 
 
At what altitude was that?

 

 
When the cruising speed of an aircraft is given, it is important to note that this is the cruising speed only after the aircraft reaches cruising altitude.

 
 http://aerospaceweb.org/question/dynamics/q0057.shtml 

Cruising altitude of a Boeing 707 is ranged from 25,000 to 40,000 feet. (7,600 to 12,200 meters for our metric folks.)

but wait, what would be the reason to tell something like that?
publicity? to reduce ppls scare from high buildings?

Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson's Whitepaper is from 1964
and constructing started in 1966

i really dont know if that was enough time to do some changes on the construction in the 60's

(Robertson, Skilling, DeMartini) words and no one jumps on you  

but its indeed not impossible that this analysis was never done, or totaly inaccurate or whatever. and they just told it for what ever reason.

 
So you failed to read the Robertson paper where he said they did a study

you failed to show where anyone, Robertson, Skilling, or DeMartini said 600 mph. DeMartini got it wrong, he said fully loaded, Robertson explains clearly that it was a low fuel aircraft.

Robertson's work make sense, I have explained it. You post 600 mph for cruise speed, that is over 20,000 feet in the air. Your 600 mph is failed, no study was done for building survival with people in it at 600 mph, that study was a slow-flying aircraft, you can use 180 mph.
 
 
 
DC, Robertson said to the best of his knowledge, the effect of fuel had not been considered in the design.

 
Fuel was considered.

"Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed," he said. "The building structure would still be there."-Jeff Skilling Head Structural Engineer WTC.  Source: Seattle Times after the first WTC bombing. 

Pay particular attention to what Skilling thought would bring the buildings down...or read my quote at the bottom of this.  

It makes little sense to design the towers to the slower speed of the airplane. This IMHO tarnishes the education and intellectual abilities of the structural engineers who designed the towers. 181 or more mph's and the towers are destroyed? Skilling and company most likely would have considered mechanical failures, pilot errors, etc. i.e worst case scenarios when designing for the impact of a plane, not just planes preparing to land.

Robertson in his quote is completely wrong. Either he failed to remember or failed to tell the truth. Liability is a biaach.
 
 
 
Pay particular attention to what Skilling thought would bring the buildings down...or read my quote at the bottom of this.  

 
i always thought the quote was kindof silly, what was skilling (and you) trying to refute, the notion that the towers were somehow impervious to explosives?

its strange some take only Robertson's word.
it was the firm Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson that maybe made that analysis. Robertson worked for them, afaik. and later started his own company.

i always thought the quote was kindof silly, what was skilling (and you) trying to refute, the notion that the towers were somehow impervious to explosives?

 
"However," he added, "I'm not saying that properly applied explosives - shaped explosives - of that magnitude could not do a tremendous amount of damage."
 
 
 
Fuel was considered.

"Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed," he said. "The building structure would still be there."-Jeff Skilling Head Structural Engineer WTC.  Source: Seattle Times after the first WTC bombing. 

Pay particular attention to what Skilling thought would bring the buildings down...or read my quote at the bottom of this.  

It makes little sense to design the towers to the slower speed of the airplane. This IMHO tarnishes the education and intellectual abilities of the structural engineers who designed the towers. 181 or more mph's and the towers are destroyed? Skilling and company most likely would have considered mechanical failures, pilot errors, etc. i.e worst case scenarios when designing for the impact of a plane, not just planes preparing to land.

Robertson in his quote is completely wrong. Either he failed to remember or failed to tell the truth. Liability is a biaach.

 
Sad to see you have not learned anything about 9/11 in 6 years.

Skilling never said 600 mph. Sorry, the fuel would be a big fire, but at a slow speed the building would survive. It is a matter of energy. You have not provided the KE to figure out anything.

The fuel injected in a high speed impact was not studied. 10,000 gallons of fuel? The low fuel state would be 1,000 gallons of fuel or less due to being lost in the fog. With more fuel, as the pilots told Robertson, the plane would not risk being lost trying to land!

So we have statements which mean nothing, and you who can not explain it! Wowzer. What a bunch of lame ideas on design. Now we have all our buildings for 600 mph, 2600 pounds of TNT KE events? Right. Good job 9/11 truth supporter;

and about the VMO at SL

taking in consideration that even ppl inside the US army, set up a plan of false flag terrorism including remote controlled faked airplane, Operation Northwoods, 1962 (was not carried out)

how far fetsched would it be in 1964, to consider the full speed and the fully loaded 707,flying on purpose into the buildings ?

The kinetic energy released by the impact of a Boeing 707 at cruise speed is
= 0.5 x 336,000 x (890)^2/32.174
= 4.136 billion ft lbs force (5,607,720 Kilojoules).

The kinetic energy released by the impact of a Boeing 767 at cruise speed is
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (777)^2/32.174

Could you please explain to me what those numbers mean? (yes I'm sandbagging you because I do know)

Hint= Velocity+mass (KE) doesn't equal fuel load
 
 
This is just crazy. DC is clearly jerking everyone's chain. He hasn't read any technical literature or serious reports on 9/11. This is like talking with LC or Red Ibis; DC is a "no-claimer." Just JAQ-ing around.

I mean, good luck with this, but the discussion has no point.

W = 0.5*m * v²

W is kinetic energy of a mass (m) at speed v².

The kinetic energy of an object is the energy wich it gets do to its motion. It is the summ of the work needed to accelerate that object of mass(m) from 0 to its speed v². and once it has that energy it will be unchanged untill another force is applied. like airresistance or a WTC tower.

what does one have to do with the other? northwoods would not have used a large airliner, nor was the intent to crash it into a building

The question was fuel load why are you quoting KE equations we all know? We know the planes where similar in size (mass).

Let me give you some advice. When your already in a hole and you want to get out, STOP DIGGING.

hell northwoods was classified at the time of the WTC construction so the designers wouldnt even have known about it

 Nope .

 
"We looked at every possible thing we could think of that could happen to the buildings, even to the extent of an airplane hitting the side," said John Skilling, head structural engineer. " However, back in those days people didn't think about terrorists very much."

Seem to be using two different speeds for the aircraft

707 = 600 mph or 890 fps

767 = 525 mph or 777 fps

Comparing apples to oranges as they say - a 767 is about 15% larger than 707 so
if velocity is the same expect 15% more energy generated by 767 impact.

I don't know what to make of such grammar, but as per usual a twoofer using pure conjecture.
 
 
I see the argument however (I feel) there is a fundamental difference between analyzing a building design's performance in an assumed likely situation (707 low on fuel looking to land), which seems to be what Skillings, Robertson, et al, did, and designing a building to withstand what would be a design basis disaster condition (fully loaded/fueled airliner at full speed) which seems to be what SD thinks they did or should have done.

If I mistated SD's position, sorry, but I would point out that one underlying presumption by Skillings, et al, was that any aircraft hitting the WTC towers would be an accident not a deliberate act. That affects the assumptions that one would make about the nature of the disaster. An accidental impact assumes the pilot wants to live and is looking for a safe way or place to land (i.e. low on fuel, can't fly to another airport, and flying relatively slowly), whereas a deliberate impact assumes the pilot does not care to live and, for whatever reasons, would or could decide to fly at maximum speed into the building. There is no indication that the deliberate act case was a consideration in their analysis.

i dont see it that way, but that oc is dependend on the poiint of view.
i still think 180 MPH is not a fact, like that fire consideration is not a fact, even when skilling says so. the word of one man is not enough.

sure you can always belive the word of someone, but i would not call it a fact.

like, just cause Aaron Russo said David rockefeller had foreknowledge about 9/11, does not make it a fact, while i doubt he just made it up. but i dont consider it a fact. and that was actually my whole point.

some ppl take that as fact what fits theyr belive. thats the same on both sides.

How exactly, then, does either analysis fit with what you believe? The whole question of what was calculated by hand in 1964, whatever its starting assumptions, is quite irrelevant given that the truth movement routinely discards the conclusions of state-of-the-art computer modelling carried out forty years later. The whole question of the 1964 calculation is one of the biggest non-issues ever raised by the truth movement, despite the stiff competition.

Dave
 
 
That's a terrible contradiction. Maybe it was already stated on a post, but ask yourself this question:

When you try to park with a car, do you park at 200 KPH? No, you don't. Same goes for the 707. When you land, you must go with a specified approach speed. Also you must consider that if there is a dense fog the approach speed would be a tad slower because of the fact that you have to travel with instruments, etc.

I don't believe that a 707 would try to land at 600 miles per hour. That's outright silly.

i did never refuse the FE models of impact for example.
FE modeling and sims are part of my job. but i can only dream of the detail level that NIST was able to do  

for me the 600 MPH seems to fit, not exactly to my theory, but the damage caused by the impact of the planes was what they described. if they calculated it or not. the towers withstood the impact, sure it was weakened, but it was standing atleast 56 minutes.

but then there was those huge fires.

but thats why i added that tiny little ?

because that is just all the avaible info puttet together into one question. and indeed landing at 600 MPH while lost in the fog, makes no sence at all.
 
 
 
taking 180 mph as a fact, is not very rational  

 
Yes it was very rational. It fitted into the assumptions made when Skillings and Robertson had to analyze probable building performance for an aircraft impact. You can dispute whether the basic assumptions -- aircraft lost in the fog, low on fuel, seeking to land -- or even the overall premise -- that the impact would be an accident and not deliberate -- was rational or reasonable, but given those assumptions trying to effect a safe landing while at 600 mph would be a ludicrous one.

Note I am not saying that the pilot would touchdown at 600 mph, but that using 600 mph as a starting speed, given the assumptions, would be ludicrous.

It might also be noted that 180 mph or whatever was not a boundary condition beyond which the building would collapse or, at least, behave differently (this is more aimed at what I think was SD's posting, so if I am wrong sorry). When making assumptions, the person making the analysis has to make decisions about what the parameters were for the analysis. They didn't start at say stalling speed of a 707 and then incrementally work their analysis again and again up to 180 mph and then found that at 181 the building would do something different (like collapse) and chose to stop there. They chose parameters consistent with their understanding of their assumptions and worked it out.

They weren't being paid to find out at what point the building might collapse, they were being paid to see how it would perform under the given assumptions.

Back to the usual back and forth.  
 
 
Until 1968, there had been 5 or 6 aircraft hijackings in the United States.
The assumption that any pilot would be willing to kill himself and everybody on board was a silly notion back then, and indeed, still was up until Sept 2001.
No pilot was going to be flying faster than max maneuvering speed when he KNOWS that there is stuff as tall as he is high around, unless he is unable to maintain altitude (too slow).
That was the scenario they analyzed, post-design--and by hand. You kids have to remember--you pretty much have as much computer capability on your desk as the total that existed in the world back in 1964.
 
 
You might also consider the context of the study. It was a response to politically motivated emotional arguments by people with opposing financial interests. "What if an airliner hits these buildings you're building?"
As an answer, you're going to want your analysis to make the building design look as safe as possible. And to do that, you're going to choose the lowest energy plausible scenario.
Off course in the fog, flying approach speed, is plausible. Six hundred miles an hour, when the speed limit below ten thousand feet is 250 knots, is not. Low on fuel is plausible, because if you were full of fuel, you'd fly to an alternate airport that wasn't fogged in.
 
 
 
FE modeling and sims are part of my job.

 
How many degrees of freedom would you use to model an element loaded axially (and in no other direction) for an elastic analysis? Let's assume that it is made up of concrete with dimensions 12"x12" and 4 #9 rebar with 3" clear cover.
 
 
 
The title of this thread is a good analogy for the truth movement: lost in the fog and trying to land at 600 mph...

 

They're lost in fog alright, but they're not trying to land - they never took off. They got lost taxiing to the runway and have gone off into the weeds.

I never said I was a claim adjuster or agent when I was the mailroom clerk at the insurance company.
He could have some knowledge but then he would be able to trust Robertson's engineering tradeoffs on the issue of a the slow-flying impact. And I believe if he has some expertise in structures or analysis he could see that the many narratives talking about local damage to the WTC in an aircraft impact study can not mean at 600 mph. It is impossible for a truther to have expertise in anything to do with 9/11 and be in the truth movement without some fatal bias making them override their science to become false information hounds.

The photo that shows what I would call global damage was a plane at 590 mph, a fully loaded 707 would be a KE event of 2600 pounds of TNT, this photo is an impact event of 2200 pounds of TNT. These events are 11 and 14 times bigger than the impact event Robertson studied. Robertson's event would be local damage, as you can see the order of magnitude greater event seems to be global damage. Robertson's event had only fatalities near the impact zone, the events of 9/11 were fatal for those much further from the impact area.
 
Is this global damage instead of local damage?

A civilian passenger jet flying at 600 miles per hour at an altitude of 1,000 feet for any reason makes no sense.

Well, that accusation would hurt if you weren't the one actually doing that yourself. Then it is just funny. You accept the word of conspiracy videos and websites as if they are the gospel truth, no questions asked. You also reject anything that supports the 'official story' without question. I hope you don't consider yourself to be a skeptic.

Like most truthers, you think the ONLY information we have about the attack come from 'official' sources, as if the government just told us what to think and we accepted it. You wish that was the case, I'm sure, but I think it's a little arrogant of you to imply that whoever disagrees with you is just blindly obeying the government.

We have absolutely no problem imagining people inside the government lying. Many of them are lawyers, after all.  

What we have a problem with is the idea that so many of them could lie about something that killed so many people, and yet no one can detect the lie except Scooby and the gang.

Nixon, as powerful as he was, couldn't even keep a simple burglary quiet. Clinton couldn't keep a sexual indiscretion quiet. These were things that only involved a small number of people, and yet their lies were uncovered relatively quickly.

Why? Because the more powerful you are in government, the more powerful your political enemies are going to be. This will guarantee that there will be a constant vigil for any misstep that might be used against you.

Well, if you paid close attention to the snarky, back-biting partisan politics in Washington, you would have a little more trust. Opponents of, say, President Bush will trumpet any perceived misstep by him, even though most of the time it's of little consequence (they constantly criticize his language skills, for instance). Why would they expend so much energy attacking him for mundane flaws if they had such heavy ammunition to use against him? If your beliefs about 9/11 were true, Bush would have been out of office (and possibly sitting in a jail cell) six years ago.

It would be more helpful to actually provide evidence that 911 was a crime or conspiracy instead of talking about hypothetical situations. Is every crime or conspiracy inside YOUR government exposed? Perhaps YOUR government was behind 911.
 
 
 
was every crime or conspiracy inside your government exposed?

 
Impossible to say. The statement, "there are crimes or conspiracies within the government that have never been exposed" is unfalsifiable, and therefore only of speculative interest.

However, the ones that were exposed were done so by qualified investigators...either law enforcement or journalists. As far as I know, not one crime or conspiracy on the part of individuals within the government has been uncovered by amateurs Googling conspiracy theory websites on the Internet.

i suspect there to be a conspiracy.
for your government, it is enough for them to lock up ppl, kidnapp them, torture them, all based on suspecting them to be terrorist.

well i would say when they have a right to do that, i have a riht to demand reinvestigations becuase i suspect there is a conspiracy.
 
 
i suspect Cheney, can i waterboard him?
 
 
 
Until 1968, there had been 5 or 6 aircraft hijackings in the United States.
The assumption that any pilot would be willing to kill himself and everybody on board was a silly notion back then, and indeed, still was up until Sept 2001.
No pilot was going to be flying faster than max maneuvering speed when he KNOWS that there is stuff as tall as he is high around, unless he is unable to maintain altitude (too slow).
That was the scenario they analyzed, post-design--and by hand. You kids have to remember--you pretty much have as much computer capability on your desk as the total that existed in the world back in 1964.

 
This is a poor excuse to disavow the point. Pilot error would be taken into consideration as well as mechanical failure of the plane that would consider the speed of the impact greater than 180mphs.

Motivation, such as "hijacking" or being "lost in fog" would not be used to consider design parameters of a building, but the performance capabilities of the jet at that time period would be.

Just because you suspect something does not give you right to demand anything. For you to demand anything you have to present evidence to back up your suspicions.

When you are ready feel free to do so.

...except that the people doing the study were the very same ones who would benefit from a positive conclusion. What possible incentive would they have to use parameters that could possibly lead to a negative conclusion, one that would cause investors to balk?

And why do you guys always question the motives of people, except where it seems to help your case to do otherwise?

Since you have no, as in zero, facts for your pilot error, or mechanical failure as a probable accident for a building in NYC making the plane go past it's normal speeds, your ideas are on the not applicable list of failure. Logical thinking could help or a degree in engineer so you can think about trade offs made during design, then course on how to research so you can read Robertson's work which says lost plane in fog, slow-flying speed. (oops, lost in fog, pilot error)

See, Cory Lidlle's plane hit at a normal speed pilot error.

The plane that hit the Empire State building pilot error, normal speed (lost in fog, oops).

So you need to back up your empty rhetoric with some numbers and events.

But your post is as empty as my post. What was your point? Oh, 6 years and still no breakthroughs from 9/11 truth just empty rhetoric, false information, and wild speculation.

and beachnut, i call that local damage yes.

and i know how it looked like, no need to post that ppic over and over again.

can you imagen what is also in that fireball?

 
In the global fireball, yes, the people you say would be alive because you are calling this local damage like the narratives you posted with a speed in error! The max weight 707 fully fueled would have been BIGGER event. Then you would be saying local damage and what do you tell the families, Herr local damage guru. Right, you made an error. oops

Local damage. Local damage does not damage the core and kill most the people on the floor. You listed narratives which stated local damage would only kill those in the area of impact. You see the photo is killing people all over the building not just in the area of impact. As you see, the area of impact did not stop the aircraft on 9/11 because the impact energy was 11 times greater than design.

Therefore you have chosen poorly and failed to understand even the stuff you posted does not fit a 600 mph impact. BTW, the 600 mph impact is a 14, the photo was an 11, and the design impact would be a 1, in terms of impact energy. If you were an engineer, the order of magnitude would come to bear, and you would say significant.

What I am saying the photo shows global damage from the impact point, with local damage being an impact 11 times less than the photo.

But you claim to be able to do the energy thing, but fail to analysis, you may as well flip burgers, cause any real training in logical thinking or math and physics has been wasted. And since you dismiss first hand testimony in the form of a written paper by Robertson to use hearsay bs from the internet, you may want a refund on you education.

 
You say local damage confined to the impact area; you need to tell the person in the far corner why he died when you said he would not die form local damage you posted it!
 
 
In design--any design--we consider contingencies.
Why would an aircraft be below 1300 feet AGL over NYC at the time of the original design?
1. It was attempting to land
2. It was out of fuel
3. It had an instrument malfunction
4. a set of combinations of 1,2, and 3
5. It was deliberate--pilot show-boating sort of thing
6. It was out of control (crashing)

of those contingencies, 1 and 3 involve a loss of visual clues, i.e., fog/clouds, otherwise the pilot would avoid being at that location.
for no. 2, it would take an amazing number of failures, and it would be assumed the pilot would steer clear (ditch in, say, a near-by ocean or river) while he still had altitude to maneuver, unless he was on approach at the time.
For 1, 2, and 4 he would be fairly slow-approach speed--and certainly without a full load of fuel. With 3, he would have auditory and performance clues that he was lower than expected.
For 5--there is a reason that the crew consists of more than just a pilot. One would assume that the copilot, navigator, and cabin crew would wrest control away from the pilot before such a contingency arose.
For 6, and 5a(deliberate sabotage, intent to cause mayhem, pilot disabling everybody on board) these are deliberate and intentional, or unpreventable acts. You cannot design to envelope that. You have to hope that they will miss.
So, of all the scenarios, the most probable involve slow speed, reduced fuel load, and a lack of visual clues as to location.
thus, the events designed for had a higher probability of occurrence, while the event with the lowest probability of occurrence is what actually happened.
You cannot envelope every contingency. You have to hope that the guys who do other jobs--pilots, aircraft designers, ATC, maintenance, security, etc, are as good at their jobs as you are at yours.

what a bunch of false claims and ad hominem atacks.

kid

like Skilling said, the biggest problem would be the jetfuel. it would kill alot ppl he said. but the steel structure would remain.

it was local damage, including the damage at the core. and sure not global damage, well after 56 it became global damage. but until then it was local damage. local on those floor that got hit by the planes.

and btw, do you like to post pictures of 100's of ppl exploding in a huge local fireball? thats not a hollywood fireball. its full with pieces of ppl.

others go and kidnap ppl, fly them all over the planet and torture them, after it turns out they are innocent they let them free.

that seems to be total legal. suspection is enough nowadays, get used to it.

i will let Cheney go if it turns out he is innocent.

It proves the 600 mph junk was in error, as does first hand evidence from Robertson instead of the hearsay junk you posted with 600 mph in it.

Even NIST posted 180 and the 600 mph junk as a history of the building design and ownership statements. Did you miss that when you posted the hearsay junk? Yes, the 180 would be hearsay in NIST, but when Robertson published it also, your 600 mph melts into an error, which you prefer to repeat, so the image of global damage to the WTC in proof in practice, in reality, that the 600 mph was added in error just like when you looked it up at Boeing without using logic to place in in context.

I do not understand why are posting anyway since you are only here to study how I and others react when people post hearsay and false information and present it to others. Like you are doing.

There's no reason at all why you should prevent evidence. You could try holding your breath until your face turns blue unless you get a new investigation instead, or writing a letter to Santa Claus asking for a new investigation for Christmas, or refusing to eat up your cabbage until you get a new investigation. However, presenting evidence is the only way you'll ever achieve anything.

its interesting that you take Robertson's word for fact.
got any ecidence that Robertson was involved in that Analysis?
how some that he has no clue if fires was considered, while Skilling remembered it?
Skilling was atleast a Senior Partner of that firm that made that analysis, or claim to have made it. Robertson was just working for them.

You have not paid attention. The hearsay narratives, the stuff you posted, allude to local damage as predicted by Robertson's slow-flying aircraft. The hearsay stuff you posted has actual facts in it, but you glommed on to the 600 mph, as they did in error. You have presented evidence for the slow-flying study Robertson did on the WTC towers.

Sorry, Robertson was the one in charge of the structural design, you have made an big error again. You need to get at least one fact straight, Robertson is the one who signed off on the structure and was responsible for the design study. He was the man on the structure. Please study before posting.

Evidence, he was in charge of those design issues. Ask him, I have studied him, I have given you enough clues to figure this out, I have use repetition, a key to learning for some. Yet you persist on showing you have not done enough research to grasp the stuff you posted..

You have had 6 years to figure this out and you have not even studied 9/11 and the topics? Why?

lol, you have read, now you are just a troll

not a single useful input since the OP where you had the answer I distilled for you

you seem to be intent of spreading hearsay and false information and not searching for the truth, totally content in your lack of knowledge?

lol
 
 
DC, here's the put up or shut up question:

If there was an engineering study done in 1964, when the computing power available was less than you have on your desktop, that concluded that the Twin Towers would withstand the impact of a Boeing 707 travelling at 600mph, in what way do the results of this study suggest any anomaly in the events of 9-11, and in what way does any such anomaly suggest the need for a new investigation into the collapse of the WTC towers given that a study done after the event concluded that the combined effects of the impact and the jet fuel initiated fire resulted in collapse initiation?

A few points that will be irrelevant to your answer are: any speculation on whether collapse initiation will lead to global collapse (as this has nothing to do with the parameters used in the 1964 study), any speculation on the possibility of the Twin Towers being demolished using explosives (as this has no bearing on the conclusions of the NIST study) and any attempts to complain at the audacity of anyone who actually calls upon you to back up your arguments with evidence and reasoning.

If you can't formulate a satisfactory answer, why are you still here?

failure to spot errors and correct them, most of 9/11 truth suffers the same affliction

But then you have to translate all this while living in the UK, it is hard to do, maybe you lack of knowledge of English is the key?

Your political bias is so strong it does not let you use logic to figure out 9/11, so you support the lies of 9/11 truth to make up for your feelings on war. Not very good logic. Take your anti-war stuff and stop making up false information about 9/11.

thats what happened on 9/11....

 
The WTC towers were designed in the 1960s. Unless you can demonstrate that the WTC designers were prescient, they had no reason at all to design against a civilian passenger jet flying at 600 mph at 1,000 feet.

Backed up! (even your OP supports Robertson)

If you read the information you supplied in the OP, you will see nothing you posted disputes what Robertson said. The only problem is the 600 mph, and you have yet to go beyond hearsay and false information to show a first hand source for a 600 mph design, yet I have produced with evidence supplied to you, support of Robertson's work, and first hand written slow-flying proof.

You will never produce first hand evidence, you will repeat your hearsay or rant about Iraq. Worthless as evidence.

but noone brought up any evidence.
 
 
 
This is a poor excuse to disavow the point. Pilot error would be taken into consideration as well as mechanical failure of the plane that would consider the speed of the impact greater than 180mphs.

 

Wishful thinking. Just to add to the previous comments, a 707 low enough to have collided with the World Trade Center would have either been flying an instrument approach, or executing a missed-approach procedure, both of which are flown at about 150 knots (about 175 mph). Even in the highly unlikely event that the pilot flying would significantly exceed these speeds, the pilot not flying and/or the flight engineer would almost certainly notice the error and correct the situation.

As for mechanical failure, beachnut can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the only one that would increase airspeed would be failure of the flaps, necessitating a no-flaps approach, which would add about 20 kts to approach and climb-out speeds, if I'm reading the 707 chart correctly.

In any case, neither of these events would increase approach airspeed to 600 mph, or even 300 mph, and to claim otherwise is simply absurd.

 
Motivation, such as "hijacking" or being "lost in fog" would not be used to consider design parameters of a building, but the performance capabilities of the jet at that time period would be.

 

No. This comment frankly belies a tremendous ignorance of the way engineers and other design professionals do their jobs. All designs involve trade-offs; money, time, and other resources on any project are invariably limited, and increasing safety almost always entails either increasing cost or decreasing functionality. Further, at some point increasing safety inevitably runs into the law of diminishing returns, where small increases in safety require large increases in cost or reductions in functionality (or both).

For example, automobiles are crash-tested in Europe and the United States at speeds of 30-40 mph (about 50-70 kph). By your logic, vehicles should be tested at at least twice those speeds (or higher), because those are the "performance capabilities" of most models.

No flap approaches would be fast for landing; but 200 knots or lower. It is absurd for high speeds.

Available evidence indicatest that the issue of nuclear-reactor resistance was not seriously considered until the 1980s. See  here . There were definitely no established standards for resistance to an aircraft crash.

By the same token, aircraft impact was not considered in the construction of military buildings.

As a side note, the resistance of the containment vessel to aircraft impact is not particularly relevant, as using a kamikaze to take out the control building would have a high probability of causing a meltdown.  

Frankly, DC, I think your question demonstrates that you are either unable or unwilling to grasp a basic point that has been made several times, namely, that in 1964 the idea of terrorists' using an airliner as a weapon was so far beyond the ken of most Americans that it would have been extremely unlikely to have been considered. Bear in mind also that since the end of World War II there had only been a handful of what could properly be called terrorist incidents in America, resulting in the deaths of only a handful of people.
 
 
I only have anecdotal (i.e. usenet and no personal) information that reactor containments were designed to withstand an impact by a 707 (largest aircraft of that time). Supposedly the reactor's FSAR would say something about that. I would conjecture that, given the concerns expressed by concerned people, and opponents of nuclear power, there would have been some effort to determine adequacy.

I did find this ???paper??? "  Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors  " dated September 2007 of which the following extract might be relevant (FWIW):

 
...
The analyses used a fully-fuelled Boeing 767-400 of over 200 tonnes as the basis, at 560 km/h - the maximum speed for precision flying near the ground. The wingspan is greater than the diameter of reactor containment buildings and the 4.3 tonne engines are 15 metres apart. Hence analyses focused on single engine direct impact on the centreline - since this would be the most penetrating missile - and on the impact of the entire aircraft if the fuselage hit the centreline (in which case the engines would ricochet off the sides). In each case no part of the aircraft or its fuel would penetrate the containment. Other studies have confirmed these findings.
...

 
 
 
 
what impact speeds are considered for nuclear facilitys or Military buildings in the 60's?

 
They weren't. At least not plane impacts. They were (to a degree) designed for blast, and you can try and find TM51300 which outlines the method in which later facilities (probably 90's) were designed. The codes that say what level of protection a certain type of facility needs to be designed for were classified and still are. Even civilian buildings that are designed for blast have their level of protection under lock and key.

It doesn't make sense to design a building for a certain blast event, say a 1000kg truck bomb at close proximity, and then tell the world that 1100kg bomb would cause extreme damage, now does it?

That's a viable alternative theory to why we've not seen specific calcs, I suppose. Why would they publish them?
 
 
 
i have been told several times what some belive is the reason for those 600mph beeing wrong.

but noone brought up any evidence.

 
Well, maybe people are waiting for your evidence to support your views. It IS only fair, you know. You're the one claiming inside job. You aren't going to prove your case by trying to poke holes in the official theory and shove an unsupported theory down our throats in its place.

Oh, wait. You've yet to provide ANY alternative theory that fits all the available evidence better than the 'official story'. I guess you're safe, because you're Just Asking Questions.

I posted before that your OP had the back up. So your own OP answers the question and you fail to understand it was found in NIST, 180 mph, told by the chief, 180 mph. After being shown the facts, you are too much a faithful truther to even make an attempt to discuss it. You post more useless junk without even posting evidence, you just want an opinion to count, your own in a factual event, where opinions are worthless and evidences rules.
For you a powerful political bias wins; knowledge, and logical thought, failed to penetrate another 9/11 truth mind shielded with impenetrable opinions based on hearsay, false information, and ignorance of 9/11 details.

I'm a she, Beachnut.  

A bit tangential to the topic, but

I was looking for information on the 1945 Empire State Building crash and found this  article  which is quite interesting. It describes some of the similarities and differences between that crash and 9/11:

 
The crash tore a hole about 18 ft (5.5 m) wide by 20 ft (6 m) tall in the 34th Street exterior of the Empire State Building. While the 78th and 79th floors bore the brunt of the damage, one of the B-25's engines fell down an elevator shaft and set off a major fire in the basement. The other engine hurtled across the building and tore through seven walls before emerging from the 33rd Street side of the tower. The debris crashed through the roof of a thirteen-story building across the street where another fire erupted. Other heavy wreckage, including the landing gear, also caused damage to the Empire State and nearby buildings while Stan Lomax reportedly saw part of a wing catapulting towards Madison Avenue.

 

It's worth listening to the radio news report that is linked. It includes interviews with two women who were on one of the lower floors, and also a recording (from a dictaphone, I guess) with the sound of the plane and impact in the background.

Interestingly, the author claims that the ESB is still considered one of the world's safest skyscrapers in the event of a fire.

This is where part of the design parameters came from for planning for an aircraft impact at the WTC. Bad weather, like fog, and a lost plane. Robertson mentions this accident. The 707 was much larger, but about the same speed. The impact energy of the 707 would be 10 times the B-25. The WTC had a much stronger shell than the ESB due to the design. 9/11 was 7 to 11 times the KE impact design for an impact of the 707.

Not even close to derail; it is one reason Robertson did a design study for a 707 impact of a slow-flying, lost plane.

First, Robertson was the head structural engineer; that fact creates a presumption that what he says is accurate. In order to overcome that presumption, you must present compelling evidence that he's mistaken (or that the Men in Black are threatening his family, etc.). There is no original source or other back-up available for the 600 mph claim; for all we know it could have been a misinterpretation or a typo. Most likely it was a misinterpretation; 600 mph is the approximate cruise speed of a 707 at altitude.

Second, as has been pointed out to you repeatedly, there is no logical reason to believe that anyone would have used 600 mph as the impact velocity, and every reason to believe that 180 mph would have been used. The only way a 707 could have been a) traveling anywhere near 600 mph, and b) low enough to hit the WTC, is if the pilot had been crazy and/or suicidal. Had one of the pilots attempted to fly the plane in such a manner, he would undoubtedly have been subdued by other crewmembers. Finally, as noted, the idea of a suicide terrorist attack using an airliner would have been virtually inconceivable.

i think they used 600 MPH

after pearl harbor im pretty sure they used full speed.

Robertson is not good in remembering stuff. he forgot about the fires, while Skilling did remember it.

its nonsence to take one mans word without any evidene and call it fact.

and the Buildings did take the impact on 9/11 very well.

In order to overcome that presumption, you must present compelling evidence that he's mistaken (or that the Men in Black are threatening his family, etc.). There is no original source or other back-up available for the 600 mph claim;

 
This is comical. You need to show why the 600 mph claim is false, not the other way around. In light of the fact the study was done which could be used by the defense in a lawsuit by real estate baron Lawrence Wien called reporters to his office to charge that the design of the Twin Towers was structurally unsound. it lends even more credibility to the study.

 
for all we know it could have been a misinterpretation or a typo. Most likely it was a misinterpretation; 600 mph is the approximate cruise speed of a 707 at altitude.

 
For all you know, you are making things up to not accept the number. Hey maybe aliens made up the number. Sheesh.
I suggest you offer factual evidence as to why the 600mph is wrong in the white paper. I find it interesting that you ask for compelling evidence to support the number but offer NONE to disprove the number. The fallacy of hypocrisies!
Not only that, you would expect to find a correction of the speed if it were wrong.

 
Second, as has been pointed out to you repeatedly, there is no logical reason to believe that anyone would have used 600 mph as the impact velocity, and every reason to believe that 180 mph would have been used.

 
Wrong. I listed several reasons, and not to mention the impending lawsuit. You apparently think airliners traveled without mechanical failure.

 
The only way a 707 could have been a) traveling anywhere near 600 mph, and b) low enough to hit the WTC, is if the pilot had been crazy and/or suicidal. Had one of the pilots attempted to fly the plane in such a manner, he would undoubtedly have been subdued by other crewmembers. Finally, as noted, the idea of a suicide terrorist attack using an airliner would have been virtually inconceivable.[/quote]
 
1. Pilot error.
2. Mechanical malfunction.
3.Collision
4. Finally the motive of a pilot isn't going to determine a design parameter.

A pilot going crazy gets stopped by crew members, but a hijacker with a boxcutter does not. Hmmm. And finally an act of terrorism goes back to the motive issue and can wholeheartedly rejected.
By changing act of terrorism to accident, I can completely reject that line of reasoning.

 
As for mechanical failure, beachnut can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the only one that would increase airspeed would be failure of the flaps, necessitating a no-flaps approach, which would add about 20 kts to approach and climb-out speeds, if I'm reading the 707 chart correctly.

 
Wow! Planes don't accelerate in a dive. Imagine that!  

 
No. This comment frankly belies a tremendous ignorance of the way engineers and other design professionals do their jobs. All designs involve trade-offs; money, time, and other resources on any project are invariably limited, and increasing safety almost always entails either increasing cost or decreasing functionality.

 
Actually I agree with your comment. It just doesn't apply to this scenario.
THE BUILDING AS DESIGNED IS SIXTEEN TIMES STIFFER THAN A CONVENTIONAL STRUCTURE. THE DESIGN CONCEPT IS SO SOUND THAT THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE IN HIS DESIGN WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMICS OF THE STRUCTURE....Source: Richard Roth, partner at Emery Roth & Sons, the architectural firm that was designing the Twin Towers, in a three-page telegram in response to a lawsuit as discussed in City in the Sky.
After all, the both Towers survived the impact now didn't they?

 
By the same token, aircraft impact was not considered in the construction of military buildings.

 
Now your just confusing the issue.
Comprehensive studies of blast effects and their mitigation began during World War II, when the outcome of near-field explosions on structures was examined. In the United States, the Cold War era led to extensive evaluation of methods for increasing the blast resistance of military facilities.Source:  Here. 
I guess your statement would be factual if you don't consider a plane impact as causing a blast.

So in summary, you must accept the 600mph figure as being correct, until proven wrong. Perhaps a document showing a change in the design parameter, etc.
Real world events proved that the towers withstood nearly 600mph impact but you can't accept that figure as fact because of one man's faulty memory? Why is that?

 
For example, automobiles are crash-tested in Europe and the United States at speeds of 30-40 mph (about 50-70 kph). By your logic, vehicles should be tested at at least twice those speeds (or higher), because those are the "performance capabilities" of most models.

 
Hmm your comparing an automobile crash test to 9/11. I thought I'd heard it all until that.
But to counter that, I present a crash test based upon worst case conditions which if you want to be bored can read about   here .
Or to get your point to some relevance to designing buildings, I offer

The main performance goal is to ensure that adequate performance of structural fire behaviour so that:

* Means of escape is not affected by smoke and/or heat from the fire;
* The structure survives the burnout of a realistic, worst case fire and significance collapse is prevented;

 
So according to your logic, engineers did not consider worst case scenarios in building design in 1964, but nowadays they do. Wonderful logic used to attack the intelligence of engineers worldwide both in the past and the present.

because, would they have considered only 180 mph, im totaly convinced that the towers would not have resisted those impacts that well.
i cannot prove that they indeed considered 600 mph, just like noone can prove that 180 MPH was considered.

do you have any evidence, that Robertson himself was involved in the calculations for this Analysis?

and what is your evidence that Skilling was not involved in this analsysis or its calculations?

wasnt Skilling the Senior partner of the firm that made those calculations, or atleast the firm that claimed to have done those calculations.
 
 
Shouldn't you be away working on your list?
 
 
why did the Chief engineer of the American Bridge Devision of US steel corporation, who reviewed the construction, write a letter to John Skilling, the Structural Engineer of the World Trade Center. why when Robertson is the Chief structural engineer?
 
 
 
Real world events proved that the towers withstood nearly 600mph impact but you can't accept that figure as fact because of one man's faulty memory? Why is that?

 
Oh? Show me the towers. Nice try, you lack experience and what is it called when you say something that is not true. Show me the towers after less than two hours after impact. Can't show me them standing because and impact 10 times greater than design destroyed them. Oops, you would understand 10 times is significant. But you post and lack knowledge and judgment. This is engineering not a opinion posting of false information from your gurus of goo.

Sorry, Robertson is correct and if you read your post of endless goop, you actually prove Robertson correct. I gained great insight from your attempt to be smart and rant about Robertson. You posted the key to his design and support his 180 mph impact study which proves him right and you have no clue. Pearl Harbor? What the heck does that have to do with the WTC design. Not very rational at all.

Why did people list 600 mph when Skilling and Robertson never said it? Are they dumb or stupid?
Why are the designed parameters Skilling and Robertson always about a local damage scenario with less deaths than the ESB impact yet the design impact used is 10 times the impact energy of the ESB?
 
 
 
why did the Chief engineer of the American Bridge Devision of US steel corporation, who reviewed the construction, write a letter to John Skilling, the Structural Engineer of the World Trade Center. why when Robertson is the Chief structural engineer?

 
Why would the chief of a BRIDGE division care about a BUILDING? Maybe the two were buddies. Source for this letter?
 
 
 
i did not say its fact, they used 600 mph, i clearly said, i think.
because, would they have considered only 180 mph, im totaly convinced that the towers would not have resisted those impacts that well.

 
Which is not based on any calculation of any type that you have presented.

 
i cannot prove that they indeed considered 600 mph, just like noone can prove that 180 MPH was considered.

 
Except that we have the chief engineer stating the 180mph claim.

 
do you have any evidence, that Robertson himself was involved in the calculations for this Analysis?

 
He specifically states that he did. Do you have proof that he wasn't

 
and what is your evidence that Skilling was not involved in this analsysis or its calculations?

 
Where is your proof that he was.

 
wasnt Skilling the Senior partner of the firm that made those calculations, or atleast the firm that claimed to have done those calculations.

 
Skilling was a senior partner in one of the firms, but had no part in actually creating the calculations. He specifically states that "his people" made calculations. However, they weren't the only ones.

You only go with the 600mph claim because that supports your fantasy. However, you cannot state any legitimate reason why they would even consider it.
 
 
 
lack of knowledge and ESL is showing (so you have proof of 600 mph? Or just hearsay?)

You are going backwards. Like throwing out knowledge, facts and evidence to be more truthy? Back to the dark ages? Why does 9/11 truth dumb down so much of their ideas?
What was Robertson?
What was Skilling?
When will you find out?

Who is Skilling?

 http://www.djc.com/special/century/skilling.html 

 
In 1947, a bright young engineer named John Skilling graduated from the University of Washington and went to work for the small engineering firm of W.H. Witt Co. Almost 50 years later, John retired from the firm, now known as Skilling Ward Magnusson Barkshire Inc., leaving a legacy of landmark structures throughout the Pacific Northwest and around the world.

Born in Los Angeles, in 1921, John moved to Seattle to attend the U.W. He never left, although he traveled extensively both for business and pleasure.

John married young and had three children, two girls and a boy. His enthusiasm for how things work spilled over from his business side into his personal life. While most fathers teach their children to build a model airplane or car, John helped his son make a fully working television set.

John quickly advanced to principal and, together with his talented co-workers, set out to show the world what engineering could be. In the 1960's, the firm competed with prominent East Coast companies to win the structural design of the twin towers of the New York World Trade Centerthe tallest towers ever at the time.

The project catapulted John and the firm into international recognition.

John gained a reputation for his lightening-quick mind, his ability to "think like an architect," and his refusal to admit that something couldn't be done.

In 1983, John became Chairman of the firm and led its growth in the local, national, and international markets.

Prominent Northwest projects designed under his leadership include Rainier Bank Tower, the Seafirst Building and Seafirst Fifth Avenue Tower, Century Square, the 76-story Columbia Seafirst Center, and the freeway-spanning Washington State Convention and Trade Center.

Then we have to rely on common sense. There is every reason to believe the 180 mph claim since there were nearby airports and a similar event did happen. There is no possible reason why, in the '60's, they would consider 600 mph in their designs.

im sure in your mind there is indeed no possible reason for it  

but oc your free to belive the 180 mph claim, just dont call it fact  
 
 
Let's not forget that Skilings and Robertson were doing, what was in effect, a building performance appraisal in response to concerns of aircraft collisions with regarding the height of the towers. Their assumptions would have to be plausible with respect to why such an accident would occur. They were NOT designing the building to withstand aircraft collisions as a design basis for the structural engineering.

It was not (as far as I know) in the contract documents, contract specifications, or in the building code. With respect to this, it would be obviously easy to prove if it was (similar to you-know-who's concrete cores   ). In addition, meeting those specifications would entail detailed calculations (and probably actual tests of designs) else how are the engineers to PROVE they met the specifications. They have a client to satisfy if they want to get paid. No mealy mouthed statement of "of course we met the specs".

Therein lies the difference in the argument. Skilings and Robertson, as most believe, did one thing (in effect, I think a building performance apprsaisal) and Swing, in particular, wants to say the design basis for the structural design included a high speed, (I assume Swing also includes fully loaded) aircraft collision. Those are two very different things.

In the end, they made their assumptions then did some calculations. So much would be unknown -- effectiveness of the fire proofing (which might be assumed to be fully protective - remember they were probably using asbestos fire proofing among their assumptions), the extent of the fires, how long the fires might last, the actual physical damage the crash would do, etc. -- that they'd have to make guesses and not necessarily very educated guesses. At the time, they were probably reasonably sure the structure would survive the impact, but probably no way certain about the fire. A necessary, simplifying assumption might be that fire was not going to seriously affect the structure. At the time it probably was the best they could do.

OOPS, presenting Skilling stuff why? Does presenting Skilling stuff negate Robertson as chief structural engineer? More research needed by you? How will you be able to post fact filled one liners if you have to do more research? 

Why are you calling Robertson a liar? Do you have a degree in Engineering? How are you uniquely qualified to call Robertson a liar when you lack basic knowledge on most topics related to 9/11?

Robertson still chief. So? 180 mph confirmed by Skilling statement and the WTC design, don't you think?

What does pearl harbor have to do with the WTC design?

Why is Swing always wrong? But why does he present evidence he does not use but debunks his claims? And can you point out why Swing's post confirms the 180 mph design point?

Why are you posting proof Robertson was the key on the 180 mph design as backed up by Skilling? And why did you miss that NIST backs it up too? Even NIST has 180 mph, why?

You are wasting time doing one liners while the rest of the world has done the research and you are about 4 years behind if not 6. Your repition is like a history lesson of truthy stuff from way back. This is like an oldie week. Why? Have you posted here before as someone else?

Why are you acting like a troll, or are you really lacking this much knowledge on 9/11?

Why are you unable to accept evidence? Even the evidence you present and forget to read the whole section? Your OP has the source to confirm the 180 mph design point, and even Swing present enough information to do a structural assessment of the WTC on why Rogertson and Skilling used the 707 impact accident and 180 mph?

Got physics?
 
 
Can someone please post the calculations used to test the building for a 600mph impact? that should settle the issue right?
 
 
 
But thats exactly what they claimed in 1964, that they considered a 707 impacting at 600 MPH.

what evidence is there that theyr claim is false?

 

Do you have evidence anywhere in the world where a plane lost in the fog was traveling at 600 MPH below 1320 feet?
 
 
 
But thats exactly what they claimed in 1964, that they considered a 707 impacting at 600 MPH.

Which they? I don't recall an author's name on the paper that declares 600 mph. I could be wrong, of course. Can you tell me the name of the author?
 
 
I seem to recall it being mentioned somewhere that it was an architect possibly associated with PANYNJ who may have made that claim. I don't have a reference for that though.

In that regard, since it was not written down (i.e. Robertson's calculations and Skiling's analysis) or at least was not documented very well back then, any idea that the lost airliner was traveling at 600 mph may be attributed to the normal miscommunication that can happen when someone says something and the listener interprets it their way and on down the line to the point where the lost airliner, low on fuel, looking for an airport (i.e. traveling at 180 mph) is now or becomes a fully loaded 707 traveling at nominal maximum speed (600 mph).
 
 
Basically Port Authority claimed they tested for 600mph. Robertson, the guy who actually did the testing basically said "No, that's ********, we did no such thing."

are you calling Skilling and DeMartinin liars?
what is your unique qualification to do so?

i would accept evidence, but there is non. why cant you accept that there is no real evidence?

my qualifications are not important for that.

you showed me your lack of engineering knowledge already, i really doubt that you are qualified to call Skilling and DeMartini liars.

When this has come up  before  the author was said to be Malcolm P. Levy, a Port Authority engineer. (The reference at the end of the paper is MPL:fg).

 
I seem to recall it being mentioned somewhere that it was an architect possibly associated with PANYNJ who may have made that claim. I don't have a reference for that though.

 

Architect Richard Roth mentioned the 600mph claim in a  NYT article  on 15 February 1964 (not long after the date of the Port Authority paper.
 
 
why do ppl want a backup for the 600 mph claim, but not for the 180 mph?`
not very skeptical thinking.

just cause i erfuse to call something fact that is indeed not a fact?
when robertson or anyone else is able to show me those calculations i will directly accept that it is 180 MPH for fact and not 600 MPH.

or when enyone can conclusive prove that the 600 MPH was wrong.

till then i prefer the 600 MPH claim, because for me that fits alot more the damage we saw on the towers.

but again, those 600 MPH are NOT a fact.
 
 
you've already been shown why the 600 mph figure is wrong. the fact you ignore that when the reasons have been given to you and of course REFUTED BY TEH PERSON who designed the buildings, shows that you are not here to learn

9 pages, you were given the answer on page 1.

keep on trolling.

hey you are free to accept the speculations about the 600 MPH, i dont think that are valid reasons to take that 180 mph as a fact.

if you want to call it fact, thats your problem.
i will not call it fact till i saw those calculations

sorry mister teacher
but i find your evidence that NIST is wrong about the 600 MPH not very conclusive.

and just because someone is the leader of something does him not make right.
also Chiefs have to backup theyr claims, when they make claims.

for some here it is enough when the chief says something, for me it isnt.

do i do not accept the 180 nor the 600 MPH as a fact.
i do belive the 600 MPH is more likely, but i dont call it fact.
 
 
This is why you don't make claims. You can't back them up, right?

No, that is his cover story. The truth is easily discernible; he's an ideologue who believes that 911 was an inside job but doesn't have the knowledge or investigative skills to come to a conclusion on his own, so he is forced to simply try to cast doubt on the 'official story' with other people's words in the midst of those here who actually know what they are talking about. The truth is there's a HUGE amount of evidence to support the 'official story'. What is pointless is somebody arguing that evidence isn't 'proper' without providing any reason WHY he thinks so.

It's a recipe for disaster.

Even if we accept that the original analysis assumed a 600 mph impact, then the most we can conclude is that the analysis was wrong.

YES!! You are now privy to the dirty little secret: EXPERTS CAN BE WRONG! And they often are.

However, it's usually about things that only become an issue in rare, difficult-to-anticipate conditions.

At any rate, the buildings did withstand the impact and stay standing long enough to save over a thousand lives. That's really the most we can expect from any building design in such extreme circumstances.
 
 
Just from reading through this thread, I have yet to figure out its purpose. Here are the facts:

-Two Boeing jets loaded with jet fuel smashed into the towers at 500+ MPH

- The towers withstood the impacts for a good hour

-The towers then collapsed

-There were predictions made over 40 years ago that the towers could withstand jet impacts

-9/11 proved that they could, at least for about an hour

So anyways, who the hell cares what was predicted or assumed 40 years ago? Just because an expert makes an assumption does not always mean that it is going to hold true. Twoofers try and bring up the whole "Oh it was designed to withstand a jet impact!" argument all the time. That argument means exactly DICK. Technically, the towers withstood the impacts for an hour. Honestly though, you cannot predict how one of the most massive structures in the world is going to fare against that kind of impact. So many different factors have to be taken into account. Hell, the designers for sure didn't take into account the fireproofing.

So twoofers, can we please drop the whole "designed to withstand a jet impact" argument? It is extremely pointless. There are bridges that were designed to stay standing through earthquakes, but sometimes they fail. Does that mean there was a conspiracy?

You are probably right but I try to address his specific claim on this thread.

You guys are easy to rip on him and not address his specific claim.

Whether I agree with his views or not, I must agree with him that there doesn't seem to be physical evidence of these calculations.

But like I said.... it really doesn't matter to either side so who cares?
 
 
 
You are right. With you, as an engineer, who cares if someone has the story wrong? Who cares if they spread false information? Gee, who cares if the false information is spread as truth, as a starting point to spread more false conclusions and lies?

I never said anything that should give you the impression that I am for the spreading of false information.
 
 
 
I think all that DC is trying to say is that we can't be sure either way without proper evidence.

I am not sure why you guys cannot agree. It's pointless anyways.

 
You are right
We cannot be sure.
The overwhelming burden of evidence, however, indicates that the 600mph figure is not supportable:
Until 1968, there had been a total of 5 hijackings of aircraft in the US. All had been for a free ride to somewhere the hijacker(s) wanted to go but nobody else on the plane did.
There were absolutely no conceivable reasons a commercial aircraft would have been at <1300 ft AGL at speeds in excess of 200mph while still under control of the pilot.
There were numerous of reasons for a commercial aircraft to be at <1300 ft AGL at speeds of 200 mph or less.

What analysis do you do?
 
 
 
im sure in your mind there is indeed no possible reason for it  

 
It would be safe to say that in any reasonable mind there is no possible reason to believe the 600mph claim other than to support a fantasy.
 
 
56 Minutes......
 
 
 
I have said this before and I will say it again... you are a strange dude.

 

 
I never said anything that should give you the impression that I am for the spreading of false information.

 

Strange that you come in, oblivious to the evidence, you say the obvious true answer if you are in a vacuum, "without proper evidence" he can't be sure.. You make no real analysis, no contribution, just a blind statement showing you have no grasp of whether evidence was supplied or not. Just a cozy statement of assurance "why can't you guys" agree and off you go without using your own engineering abilities to weigh in on an issue you said was pointless anyways (goes to show)! Well, is there proper evidence?

I thought your post implied you think it is pointless to stop false ideas from spreading. And by your passive statement and a typical truth movement like hit and run, you go on not really caring if people make up false stuff from points that are "pointless" in your opinion.

Truth movement engineers use this point of speed in their failed false papers. They say the building were designed to resist a 600 mph impact so CD had to be used. Given the fact you are an engineer, is this the way to treat a false statement? Do you let the false information and errors continue in our job? What kind of an engineer are you?

 
I think all that DC is trying to say is that we can't be sure either way without proper evidence.

 

 
I am not sure why you guys cannot agree. It's pointless anyways.

 

Do you have some research to share? Did you even read the thread to see the evidence presented? What is Pointless? If you had defined what you really meant I may not suspect you of passive support for lies, false information and not caring if people spread false information.

Is there proper evidence available in the thread?
Why should someone agree to 600 mph when it is a false assumption?
What is pointless opposing ignorance or supporting people who spread false information?
Why are people who lack knowledge on 9/11 not able to comprehend evidence of a slow-flying study done by Robertson on the WTC?
Why do people who lack knowledge in 9/11 truth deny 180 mph study by Robertson, call him a liar behind his back, and due to their complete ignorance and biases deny the evidence?
 
 
I decided to go back you the OP and address the NIST 600mph claim fallacy.

 
According to L.Robertson, the Chief Structural Engineer of the WTC. it was a slow flying 707, trying to land, lost in the fog.

 
This is what he states his calculations were based on.

 
but according to NIST investigation, it was considering a 707 at top speed, 600 MH.

 
This is false. NIST was simply quoting a white paper that they received from the PANYNJ and nothing more. This is not a NIST claim. NIST also states the 180mph claim as well as you blatantly ignored. Since the only one who is actually making a speed claim based on calculations is Mr. Robertson, I will go with him. Please give us a realistic reason why we should believe the 600mph claim. (hint: Pearl Harbor is nowhere near realistic)
 
 
 
So twoofers, can we please drop the whole "designed to withstand a jet impact" argument? It is extremely pointless.

 

It's also a fiction. The studies of survivability that were done (whatever form that analysis actually took) occurred after the building had been designed.

indeed its wrong to say its NIST's claim, actually its PANYNJ's claim.

but are you sure that you are not ignoring anything from the NIST report?

who was the only one that actually did deliver some calculations according to NIST?
 
 
 
but are you sure that you are not ignoring anything from the NIST report?

 
Not at all.

 
who was the only one that actually did deliver some calculations according to NIST?

 
Nobody did. NIST simply reported what info they had received from both the Port Authority and FEMA.
 
 
Just thought I'd amend my earlier postings about the analysis by Robertson and Skillings being a post-design building performance oriented analysis. From the FEMA report and from NAE article written by Robertson, I find that the WTC towers were the first to apply aircraft crash as a parameter outside of military and nuclear facilities. That said, the assumed conditions for why an aircraft might crash into a WTC tower remain unchanged and in no case justifies a presumption of 600 mph as an impact speed -- that the 707 could cruise around that speed is true but irrelevant since it would not be cruising that low if it was lost in fog and seeking to land.

 Reflections on the World Trade Center 

 
The two towers were the first structures outside of the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airliner, the Boeing 707. It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark. To the best of our knowledge, little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft, and no designs were prepared for that circumstance. Indeed, at that time, no fireproofing systems were available to control the effects of such fires.

 

If not much was know about the effects of fire, chances are they would not be able to determine what else to do. Certainly the fire would kill most anyone unlucky enough to be caught on the impact floors as I believe someone pointed out that Skilling said so.
 
 
 
Not at all.
Nobody did. NIST simply reported what info they had received from both the Port Authority and FEMA.

Just thought I'd amend my earlier postings about the analysis by Robertson and Skillings being a post-design building performance oriented analysis. From the FEMA report and from NAE article written by Robertson, I find that the WTC towers were the first to apply aircraft crash as a parameter outside of military and nuclear facilities. That said, the assumed conditions for why an aircraft might crash into a WTC tower remain unchanged and in no case justifies a presumption of 600 mph as an impact speed -- that the 707 could cruise around that speed is true but irrelevant since it would not be cruising that low if it was lost in fog and seeking to land.

Not impossible is it? They probably also didn't test for another building toppling onto it either. I am sure we can think of a million other possibilities that they didn't test for.

  Welcome to JREF! It gets better.
 
 
DC,

Let's assume for the sake of argument that the WTC towers were designed to withstand a 707 impact at 600mph (leaving aside the fact that they did stand for over an hour after a 757 impact).

What does that mean, in your opinion? That they therefor needed some demolition help in order to fall?

If so, then what do you make of the fact that the "unsinkable" Titanic sank?

Oh come on Swing. You know what DC is doing. He's JAQing off. You know what that is and what the tactic entails. You know what the fallacy of trying to poke holes into a competing theory and inserting one of your own without supporting it, right?

This isn't about his English.
 
 
 
See, the people who wrote the paper did what you did, they blindly use a number they do not even understand.

You have proven my point. BTW, a 707 at 1000 feet was limited to 355 KCAS, since the skin starts to peel off above that speed and would led to sever damage and destruction if repeated, or done for long periods.

So 607 mph is not a good speed for 1000 feet, but people who lack knowledge use it to make up junk about 9/11.

 http://forums.randi.org/imagehosting...66b7c96bf7.jpg 
This is the area the KE is applied to, the WTC. You can see details in NIST. Oh, you already have. You can also get the cross sectional areas on the planes at Boeing.

 
No he did not?
 
 
 
Well lets rid the woo here..

 
 

 
John Skilling was the head structural engineer.

 

My mistake in not looking up Robertson's actual title before posting. My point was that he was the one actually creating the structural design (Skilling was supervising him) and the one responsible for signing the plans.

 
This is comical. You need to show why the 600 mph claim is false, not the other way around. In light of the fact the study was done which could be used by the defense in a lawsuit by real estate baron Lawrence Wien called reporters to his office to charge that the design of the Twin Towers was structurally unsound. it lends even more credibility to the study.

 

What's comical, frankly, is your breathtaking ignorance of both aviation and engineering. Several people have explained why no reasonable person with an understanding of flight operations would have believed that a 707 could have been flying anywhere near that fast near the WTC, but frankly you seem to be being deliberately obtuse, so I'll spell it out for you. The following  data  are from Qantas 707 manuals from the 1960s:

V NE below 25,000 ft = 387 kts (445 mph)

V LE = 320 kts (368 mph)

V NE (Velocity Not to Exceed) is the velocity beyond which the aircraft will suffer structural damage in a clean configuration. V LE (Velocity with Landing gear Extended) is the velocity beyond which the aircraft will suffer structural damage if its landing gear is extended.

 
 
1. Pilot error.
2. Mechanical malfunction.
3.Collision
4. Finally the motive of a pilot isn't going to determine a design parameter.

 

You can laugh all you want, but you're only making yourself look even more ignorant, arrogant, and foolish. Please give an example of either pilot error or mechanical failure that would have resulted in a 707's flying (as opposed to crashing) at even 450 mph below 1500 feet AGL. (hint: there aren't any) Come to that, please find an example from any accident or incident report where a jet airliner exceeded V NE while attempting to land, either due to mechanical failure or pilot error. "Collision" is even more laughable; if the aircraft in question were anywhere near the WTC when they collided, they were already moving at less than 250 kts. A collision wouldn't have magically made them speed up (except possibly straight down   ).

As for "motive," it goes to the likelihood of such a scenario, which would have been considered vanishingly small in 1964.

 
A pilot going crazy gets stopped by crew members, but a hijacker with a boxcutter does not. Hmmm.

 

Childish attempted derail noted. That aside, it would have been one crazed pilot against two other flight crew members, who possibly have assistance from the cabin crew. Four or five hijackers who claim to have a bomb, have already subdued the cabin crew, and are trained in hand-to-hand combat, against two flight crew members, who aren't expecting to be knifed. Hmmmmm.   And, despite your attempt to belittle them, box cutters can cause very serious, and even fatal, wounds.

From a Florida Supreme Court  opinion  :

 
The victim suffered a minimum of sixty incised slash and stab wounds, including severe wounds to the face, neck, back, torso, and arms. The victim also had blood stains on the knees of her pants, indicating that she had been kneeling in her blood. A forensic pathologist, Dr. Michael Berkland, testified that some of the wounds cut through the tissue into the underlying bone, and while several wounds had the potential to be fatal, the victim probably would not have survived more than fifteen minutes after the wounds were inflicted. Dr. Berkland also testified that the victim’s wounds were consistent with the use of a box cutter. A box cutter was found on a baker’s rack close to the victim’s body. Later testing showed that the box cutter had the victim’s blood on it. It was not the type of box cutter that was used at Popeye’s, but was similar to a box cutter that Hurst [the defendant] had been seen with several days before the crime. [bolding mine]

 

So please explain, if you would, Swing, how box cutters can't be used as hijacking weapons.

 
And finally an act of terrorism goes back to the motive issue and can wholeheartedly rejected.
By changing act of terrorism to accident, I can completely reject that line of reasoning.

 

No. You can't come up with an "accident" scenario involving a 707 going anywhere near 600 mph below 1500 feet (except possibly straight down after some catastrophic failure or collision, in which case what building it hits is effectively random, and the height of the WTC is irrelevant), so you can't just change that aspect arbitrarily

 
Wow! Planes don't accelerate in a dive. Imagine that!  

 

This comment demonstrates a Hollywood-level knowledge of aviation. A plane loses gravitational potential energy when it descends, and this will be converted into kinetic energy. But if the aircraft increases drag and/or decreases thrust sufficiently, it won't necessarily gain speed, especially if the dive is sufficiently shallow. Further, air resistance increases as altitude decreases, thus increasing drag. And diving madly toward an airport will not result in a landing; the aircraft will simply be moving too fast to line up on the runway and land at the proper speed.

 
Actually I agree with your comment. It just doesn't apply to this scenario.

 
THE BUILDING AS DESIGNED IS SIXTEEN TIMES STIFFER THAN A CONVENTIONAL STRUCTURE. THE DESIGN CONCEPT IS SO SOUND THAT THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE IN HIS DESIGN WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMICS OF THE STRUCTURE....Source: Richard Roth, partner at Emery Roth & Sons, the architectural firm that was designing the Twin Towers, in a three-page telegram in response to a lawsuit as discussed in City in the Sky.

 
After all, the both Towers survived the impact now didn't they?

 

My comment applies to all engineering projects, and the quoted claims in no way prove that it doesn't. Even if accepted at face value, they merely suggest that the safety returns will diminish more slowly than on most projects. See also comments on Robertson's purported bias below.

 
Now your just confusing the issue.
Comprehensive studies of blast effects and their mitigation began during World War II, when the outcome of near-field explosions on structures was examined. In the United States, the Cold War era led to extensive evaluation of methods for increasing the blast resistance of military facilities.Source:  Here. 
I guess your statement would be factual if you don't consider a plane impact as causing a blast. [bolding mine]

 

An aircraft impact does not cause a blast by itself; impacts and explosions are very different events. Sometimes an explosion can occur incident to an air crash, but the great majority of damage is likely to be caused by kinetic energy from the aircraft, and subsequent fires from its fuel supply. Though making a building generally tougher can improve its resistance to both blast and impact damage, most reinforcements are more effective against one or the other.

 
So in summary, you must accept the 600mph figure as being correct, until proven wrong. Perhaps a document showing a change in the design parameter, etc.

 

This is absolutely not the case. Sufficient evidence exists to cast significant doubt on the 600 mph figure, as has been noted.

 
Real world events proved that the towers withstood nearly 600mph impact but you can't accept that figure as fact because of one man's faulty memory? Why is that?

 

First, you're begging the question of whether Robertson's memory is faulty. Second, the fact that the towers did initially withstand those collisions is not evidence that they were intentionally designed to do so. It is possible that the strength required to withstand hurricane-force winds was greater than the strength required to resist such a collision, and that therefore the ability to absorb such impacts was merely incidental. In fact, this is suggested on p. 132 of City in the Sky.

 
Hmm your comparing an automobile crash test to 9/11. I thought I'd heard it all until that.

 

The comparison is between crash tests and a building-performance evaluation, as examples of the engineering design process. Frankly, your comment is totally asinine, and not even worthy of a 9th-grade debating class.

 
But to counter that, I present a crash test based upon worst case conditions which if you want to be bored can read about   here .

 

The link is just a Google search for the terms "crash", "test", and "parameters".   Further, whatever it is you were trying to link does not change the fact that European and American crash-test standards are based on cars' traveling at about half their maximum speeds (or less).

 
Or to get your point to some relevance to designing buildings, I offer
[url="http://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/project/research/structures/strucfire/CaseStudy/Others/default.htm"]

So according to your logic, engineers did not consider worst case scenarios in building design in 1964, but nowadays they do. Wonderful logic used to attack the intelligence of engineers worldwide both in the past and the present.

 

Affirmed consequent fallacy. The fact that some engineering projects are designed to meet a certain "worst case" does not mean that all engineering projects are designed to meet a certain "worst case." Further, the telegram shown in DC's OP states that the towers were designed for wind loads of up to 45 pounds per square foot (psf). Yet a Category 5 hurricane can generate wind loads in excess of 81 psf (see  here  ). So please explain, if you would, Swing, why the designers didn't build the towers to withstand a Category 5 hurricane? After all, you claim that engineers always design for the "worst case."

 
I suspect that the fear of a massive lawsuit is backing up Robertson's opinion.
No one can be blamed for anything. If they are, well that might just open up an investigation where someone actually can be blamed for the alleged failures.

 

The "600 mph" opinion was given in response to a lawsuit that was attempting to stop construction of the World Trade Center. Why do you assume that that claim is unbiased?
 
 
 
how much did they know about aviation, did they know that an airplane cannot fly with cruise speed at lower altitudes?

 

That actually is irrelevant.

One very implicit assumption, that hasn't been challenged, is that the pilot is responsible, and will behave as his training and experience will dictate for the conditions he's flying in.

So, if a pilot chose to fly at 600 mph at low altitude, actually very low altitude (under 1,500 feet or what 1384? feet), in a known urban area of tall buildings, the question would be WHY?

If visibility allowed for a pilot to presumably be able to avoid an obstacle while flying at 600 mph, which would be a reasonable assumption, then one presumed basis for an aircraft crash -- that it was lost in the fog -- would be invalid and an inadvertent crash would not occur. OTOH if visibility was not sufficient, the question about flying at 600 mph would still be WHY?

Assuming that sudden foggy conditions occurred, the rational response for the pilot, flying at 600 mph (going a mile every six seconds) at low level would be to hurriedly decrease his speed to something consistent with foggy conditions and, since we're talking sudden onset, he'd have a good idea that that there was a building up ahead (actually a whole skyline) and would turn away. Unlike flying in an aviation simulation or game, a pilot does not fly at an obstacle course (as the skyline would be to an aircraft) expecting to thread his way through the buildings especially with a 707 and if he expects to keep his license. As opposed to a game, hitting one of the "obstacles" will tend to permanently end his "turn".

So for the assumed conditions, after all the engineer has to start somewhere, of lost in the fog (so the collision is inadvertent), low on fuel (so the plane can not just be flown and to another airport) and looking to land (the pilot expects to be able to execute a proper landing at the local airfield), an aircraft flying at 600 mph at very low level in conditions of limited visibility would be ludicrous.

I would like to hear your explanation (or more accurately the reasoning) of why, given the assumed conditions, a pilot would be flying in limited visibility, in or towards an urban area of tall buildings, below the maximum height of the tallest building, at basically high speed (even if it was a reasonable cruising speed at altitude) for the flight conditions (which in this instance I am defining as he'd be unable to turn his aircraft to avoid an obstacle that became visible)?

A bland assertion that the 707 is capable of flying at 600 mphs is not a sufficient reason to claim that, given the assumed conditions, any rational pilot would do so. I will note that IF Robertson, et al, had used your assertion about speed, they would probably have been called upon to justify that speed by their own engineers, supervisors and managers (after all they have to sell their design to the client) as well as the PANYNJ in the face of the assumed conditions. That explanation would probably be sufficient noteworthy that people would remember it. If you choose to think that the assumed conditions were not as stated, then you should try and explain WHY you believe they are lying NOW.
 
 
 
No he did not?

 
No, he did not. He said it's not good to do so for long periods of time because it can damage the skin of the plane. And hence it is too unlikely a scenario to warrant such testing, much like testing for a school bus hitting the building at Mach 5. Both are not very probable threats. A plane low on fuel and lost in the fog at slower speeds is not uncommon.
 
 
when you make a worstcase scenarion, would you take fully loaded and full speed?
 
 
 
Actually I agree with your comment. It just doesn't apply to this scenario.

Bolding mine.

Swing, do not confuse stiffness, in a structural sense, with strength. It's quite evident from your post here that you don't know the difference between the two (or that there even was one).

Stiffness is the ability of a structure or individual structural element to resist deflection.

Strength is the ability of a structure or individual structural element to transmit a load.

The quote you're mining above doesn't say anything about the load-carrying capacity of the structure, no matter how much you think it does. Also, it's worth noting that the means for measuring each property occur on a completely different scale. For instance, in an extremely simplified example to explain the difference between these terms, let's say you have a beam that can carry 1000 lbs over a 10-foot span (small beam) and deflect 1 / 2 inch in doing so (not very stiff either). A beam that is 16x stiffer will carry the same 1000 lb load, but only deflect 1 / 32 of an inch, whereas a beam which is 16x stronger will be able to carry a 16,000 lb load. There are ways to increase the stiffness of something without necessarily directly increasing the load-carrying capacity.

Furthermore, you don't realize it, but your quote above doesn't suggest at all that the structure was over designed in any way. When engineers talk about the economics of the structure, they're usually talking about the cost of the steel involved. When he says the economics weren't effected, that suggest that all of the steel used in the design was still optimally loaded for the situation, given whatever safety factors were required in each condition, so as to not make the design extremely costly to build and remove valuable tenant space with needless structural redundancy.

NIST did not do the study, they report that PANYNJ has a paper that say:

I am saying either the 600 mph is in error, or the guys who made the complete statement are nuts! So is the speed in error, or are these people idiots? Because a 600 mph impact is equal to 2600 pounds of TNT and that is twice as much energy Flight 11 delivered to the WTC, and the damage was GLOBAL not local. Do you understand physics?

So you are trying to say the 600 mph is correct when the result would be twice as much damage as flight 11 and 30 percent more damage than flight 175! That is not local damage, it is worse than 9/11 damage. Did you even run the numbers for KE on a 600 mph, fully loaded 707? I did and the 600 mph figure is in error, or the people who said it are total idiots, no engineer helped them with that 600 mph fantasy figure resulting in local damage.

Review of Causes of WTC Collapse

Although the structural damage inflicted by aircraft was severe, it
was only local. Without stripping of a significant portion of the
steel insulation during impact, the subsequent fire would likely
not have led to overall collapse (Bažant and Zhou 2002a; NIST
2005).

Are you completely unobservant to what happened? The towers stood for almost an hour after the plane impacted. Therefor we can conclude the that plane impacts minus the fires would likely not cause collapse.

However fires + damage did.  That's the whole point.  How ignorant can one person be?

The plane impact caused global damage. How do I know this? The plane impacts severed columns and started fires. This led to the entire building being rubble on the ground.

The structural damage itself was contained to a few floors, you might call it local since it itself did not cause a collapse. But the plane impacts DID globally damage the entire building.

I know what you're trying to do here, it won't work.

according to the official theory (Bazant), the impact caused local damage.
the combination of that local impact damage and the fires triggered a global progressive collapse.

The immediate damage was local, but ultimately, the damage was global. So, neither.

You're arguing semantics now. It is a trivial fact that the entire building wasn't damaged in the initial collision, but the entire building was damaged in the collapse.
 
 
 
There was an Analysis for the WTC Towers, that considered a 707 impacting.
most do agree on that. but there is however a discussion about the considered speed.

According to L.Robertson, the Chief Structural Engineer of the WTC. it was a slow flying 707, trying to land, lost in the fog.

but according to NIST investigation, it was considering a 707 at top speed, 600 MH.

 
Can a 707 fly at a speed of 600 mph at that altitude?

Boeing claims they can cruise at about 600 mph (  source  )

Engine cruise capabilities are determined off of load condition.
Takeoff often uses 100% of max engine rpms, a speed the engine can only maintain for a short while (typically about 5 minutes) before the blade creep due to temperature and stresses causes problems.
Climb power runs the engine a little slower, at which speed the engine can normally operate for about 30 minutes.
At cruise, the engine can operate almost indefinitely because it is runnign slower still.
For examply, static conditions for a Rolls Royce Viper 20(at sea level) are shown below: Takeoff (5 min): 100% of max rpms | 13.35 kN thrust | 100.4 kg/kN*h specific fuel consumption
Climb (30 min): 95% of max rpms | 12.30 kN thrust | 98.2 kg/kN*h specific fuel consumption
Cruise: 95% of max rpms | 10.90 kN thrust | 95.1 kg/kN*h specific fuel consumption Ambient air temperature plays a part, increasing overall thrust as it decreases.
Ambient pressure also affect thrust, reducing overall thrust as it decreases.
I'm not going to go into the mechanics of how this happens (as much as I do enjoy gas turbines engine analysis, it is a lot of explaining and math), so you'll have to take it from me.
(source for above is one of my textbooks, which cost me a mere $112, a very reasonable price for a textbook: Gas Turbine Theory, 5th ed., by HIH Saravanamuttoo, GHC Rogers and H Cohen. (c) Pearson Education Limited, England, 2001, pp403-404.)

It should be common knowledge that as you increase your altitude, you decrease air pressure (exponentially) and temperature (linearly).
Just in case, I'm going to include a link to a diagram of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere  here . Note that differnet layers exhibit different properties, but since jet airliners seldom go above 15 kilometers, you can see that the reduction in temperature is largely linear over that range.
I'll also link to a diagram of pressure change,  here .

The loss of thrust from reduced pressure at altitude outweighs the gain provided by the lower temperature. This means a jet engine has less power (but more efficiency) at hhigher altitudes than at lower ones.

Unless density or humidity in the air at low altitudes would pose a risk to engine integrity (not that someone looking to crash into a building would be particularly worried, and a pilot looking to land would not be going 600 mph), there seems to be no reason why a jet plane could not go 600 mph at low altitude.

Besides, Thrust SSC  (Wikipedia link)  has gone faster, and it's a car, so you know (or at least fervently hope) it's at low altitude.

Summary, for those who don't want to read my boring verbiage:
Yes, a 707 can fly at 600 mph at sea level.

Oh, the 607 mph is at altitude. The airframe has max limit of350 KCAS. Why do you make up stuff?

Oh, not on a regular basic! The skin will start to peal at high Q, you know what I mean? You are a pilot, or an aero major, right? If you luck out an make it past a prolong period, Boeing will not service your plane until you will be pay big bucks to have your plane inspected which has exceed the top speed somewhere near, 355KCAS. How do I know, a fellow pilot was chasing me, I was going 350 KCAS, after passing.9 MACH down. He lost skin, the maintenance people were livid. So, go ahead test pilot who may die, take your 707 to 600 mph at seal level (safer at 1000 feet) and find out the meaning of high Q. cool, another person like the guy chasing me who thinks limits are for the other fellow. So cool

Can a 707 do 600 mph. If your rigging is wrong, a gear door out of place, a flap loose, an elevator, an aileron, you may wish you had not pushed the limit, and when you are in purgatory, you may get a lesson from other BOLD pilots who defied limits. Lucky you, could loose parts and loose your aircraft, the reason it is speed limited at low altitude is the tremendous pressure of air. High Q. Look it up. Hope you have an aero degree and are kidding us, or dont have an aero degree, because if you tell a client he can do 600 mph in his 707, you are going to be sued, when the bill comes in remember I told you so.

Your statement is foolish, you can not go 528 KIAS without knowledge why the airframe has a limit of 350 KCAS. Who said a man/woman has to know his limitations?

On 9/11 the planes were only over limit for 10 to 20 seconds, it also depends on how you are flying. Good luck as you over speed your 707/757/767, you better have lots of money.

I said that a 707 can fly at 600 mph at low altitude (based on a quick analysis of turbofan engines and cruise speed capabilities). Not that it should.

I sure as hell would not recommend it without a lot more analysis of structure, power, effects on engine, performance, etc etc.

As for the degree, I am a student or Mechanical Engineering, taking the Aerospace option.
I confess I have not taken an aero structures course. They can't offer it. If I graduate in December, I will have to take a technical elective in its place. If I wait until next April, they may be able to offer it. It's tempting to wait the 4 months just to take that course.

You are right. But you can have problems. And as you saw on 9/11 the new engines just keep pushing.

I was going max speed the best I could get by the book,.9 MACH and 350 KCAS. The guy behind me by about a mile or two caught me in the descent (you really have to watch the cross over from.9 MACH to 350 KCAS as you get lower) as we pitched out together in our KC-135s. Ground crews loved the high speed pitch outs, but his crew was pissed.

You really know much more than I, carry on, and ignore most of the bs. But high Q is a cool thing, it was great seeing the test pilot school trained wing commanders talk to the young pilots who had just stripped their gear doors off their T-38 when they were super sonic over the ocean. Good luck.

You are right, the terrorist ignored the limits, and rules, shoved the throttles up and hit at speed over Vmo. I have even spent a few seconds without damage above Vmo.

Good post, you covered the important points.

I know the KC ( a 707 derivative, kind of, but pre in a sense) lost skin by experience, not sure of all the real problems with a 707, but one person brought up the 757/767 may have a problem with the engine, as in overheat. Definitely a systems approach is needed.

But when I was going too fast, there was no wall, gee, the plane does.9 MACH at altitude easy, you can feel some slight buffet if you hold the yoke carefully, and the KC was flight tested to.95 MACH. Like I said at 150 MSL the KC was showing no signs of not able to go well past 355, but having known another over speed plane was loosing skin, I went to idle and almost coasted past the SR-71 who use to be in front of me a mile. No damage.

Thank you.
IMO, I feel you were right to correct me for not specifying the theoreticalness of my answer. I appreciate it.

And don't assume I know more than you. It's all still theory, and base-level at that.
Nor can I fly (someday, perhaps) and I will always take instruction from those with experience in the relevant fields.

If you build them, add as much margin as you can! If you know the consequences tell them.

 

If I was attacked by fighters or missiles, we were going to the limits and further, the more margin I have as a pilot, the better. It was cool I was pushing the limit for 3 hours, and the guy behind me was whining, I had no damage, he did. It is cool being right, and humbling to make errors.

I have some aero, but what pilots and instructor pilots need. I am a EE and have my MSEE, but my job experiencem, is very broad. I have my aero book on the dining room table; Aerodynamic for Pilots.

You may be surprised how much you do know. Being able to figure out the engine can push the 707 to 600 mph is more than most. And I bet the 707 can go 600, unless there is some problem missed. I was laughing to myself when that guy lost his skin under the wing, it was funny after listening to him whine about being behind us for a couple hours. I can't believe he exceeded the limits just to be close to us. I never was big fan of wingtip formation with 300,000 pound class jets.
 
 
 
Read your own quote. Structural Damage = local. Fire = local. Fire + Structural Damage = Global (i.e. building collapses). It's pretty straight forward.

 
wasn't it the falling upper towerpart that caused the global damage?
 
 
I think what is important to note as far as an aircraft flying at 600MPH at low altitude is that while the engines may be able to propel a given aerodynamic mass at that speed, the question still remains as to whether the airframe is capable of absorbing the stress.

A fighter aircraft is build very strong, and has a small compact frame with (notably) small wings. A large aircraft such as a 707, in contrast, has a less robust frame with very large wings.

So while the engines may propel a larger aircraft at 600MPH at low altitude, it may cause the airframe to lose integrity, resulting in a break up. (The flip side of this, of course, is that aircraft are more susceptible to break up at higher altitudes due to the difference between internal and external air pressure.)

i dont know, but how much more airresistance is there at sealevel do to the densier air?

Well at sea level air has a mean density of 1.224kg/cu m and a mean pressure of 101.292kPa. (Air temperature also affects pressure and density).

At 10,600m (cruising altitude) it has a density of 0.38338kg/cu m and a pressure of 24.151kPa.

So air at sea level is about 3 times as dense and has about 4 times as much pressure as air at cruising altitude of 10,600m (35,000ft).

Higher density equals more particles equals more resistance.

I think you'd be safe saying, nominally, that air that is twice as dense offers twice as much resistance. I don't know what affect air pressure has on air resistance. I would think it would be safe to safe that air resistance is at least 3x higher at sea level than at 35,000ft (assuming nominal temperature, moisture levels, etc).
 
 
 
DC,

Let's assume for the sake of argument that the WTC towers were designed to withstand a 707 impact at 600mph (leaving aside the fact that they did stand for over an hour after a 757 impact).

What does that mean, in your opinion? That they therefor needed some demolition help in order to fall?

If so, then what do you make of the fact that the "unsinkable" Titanic sank?

 

I didn't see this addressed, though I was only skimming the thread. If you have addressed this DC, could you link to it, or if you did not, could you please do so?

The question is more complex than it seems.

The total drag on an airplane comes from many different phenomena: skin friction, wave induction in the air (such as the formation of the sonic wake near mach 1), wing lift, and the transfer of kinetic energy needed to simply push the air ahead out of the way of the fuselage (aka form drag). Each has its own equations that depend on the pressure in different ways at different velocities.

The combination of all these factors means that in general, at typical velocities within the plane's normal operating range, drag increases with air pressure but slightly less than proportionally. In the  basic drag equation,  the dependence on air density is given as linear, but other more subtle effects of air density are hidden inside the "drag coefficient" which does not stay constant over wide ranges of conditions.

ETA: The specific phenomenon that one is concerned about might depend on specific types of drag rather than the total drag. For instance, if you want to make sure the skin stays on the airplane, you might be more concerned about skin friction -- at least until an edge begins to bend, at which point the form drag from induction of turbulent flow in a region that's supposed to be laminar then becomes the issue.

My mistake in not looking up Robertson's actual title before posting. My point was that he was the one actually creating the structural design (Skilling was supervising him) and the one responsible for signing the plans.

What's comical, frankly, is your breathtaking ignorance of both aviation and engineering. Several people have explained why no reasonable person with an understanding of flight operations would have believed that a 707 could have been flying anywhere near that fast near the WTC, but frankly you seem to be being deliberately obtuse, so I'll spell it out for you. The following  data  are from Qantas 707 manuals from the 1960s:

V NE below 25,000 ft = 387 kts (445 mph)

V LE = 320 kts (368 mph)

V NE (Velocity Not to Exceed) is the velocity beyond which the aircraft will suffer structural damage in a clean configuration. V LE (Velocity with Landing gear Extended) is the velocity beyond which the aircraft will suffer structural damage if its landing gear is extended.

You can laugh all you want, but you're only making yourself look even more ignorant, arrogant, and foolish. Please give an example of either pilot error or mechanical failure that would have resulted in a 707's flying (as opposed to crashing) at even 450 mph below 1500 feet AGL. (hint: there aren't any) Come to that, please find an example from any accident or incident report where a jet airliner exceeded V NE while attempting to land, either due to mechanical failure or pilot error. "Collision" is even more laughable; if the aircraft in question were anywhere near the WTC when they collided, they were already moving at less than 250 kts. A collision wouldn't have magically made them speed up (except possibly straight down   ).

As for "motive," it goes to the likelihood of such a scenario, which would have been considered vanishingly small in 1964.

Childish attempted derail noted. That aside, it would have been one crazed pilot against two other flight crew members, who possibly have assistance from the cabin crew. Four or five hijackers who claim to have a bomb, have already subdued the cabin crew, and are trained in hand-to-hand combat, against two flight crew members, who aren't expecting to be knifed. Hmmmmm.   And, despite your attempt to belittle them, box cutters can cause very serious, and even fatal, wounds.

From a Florida Supreme Court  opinion  :

So please explain, if you would, Swing, how box cutters can't be used as hijacking weapons.

No. You can't come up with an "accident" scenario involving a 707 going anywhere near 600 mph below 1500 feet (except possibly straight down after some catastrophic failure or collision, in which case what building it hits is effectively random, and the height of the WTC is irrelevant), so you can't just change that aspect arbitrarily

This comment demonstrates a Hollywood-level knowledge of aviation. A plane loses gravitational potential energy when it descends, and this will be converted into kinetic energy. But if the aircraft increases drag and/or decreases thrust sufficiently, it won't necessarily gain speed, especially if the dive is sufficiently shallow. Further, air resistance increases as altitude decreases, thus increasing drag. And diving madly toward an airport will not result in a landing; the aircraft will simply be moving too fast to line up on the runway and land at the proper speed.

My comment applies to all engineering projects, and the quoted claims in no way prove that it doesn't. Even if accepted at face value, they merely suggest that the safety returns will diminish more slowly than on most projects. See also comments on Robertson's purported bias below.

An aircraft impact does not cause a blast by itself; impacts and explosions are very different events. Sometimes an explosion can occur incident to an air crash, but the great majority of damage is likely to be caused by kinetic energy from the aircraft, and subsequent fires from its fuel supply. Though making a building generally tougher can improve its resistance to both blast and impact damage, most reinforcements are more effective against one or the other.

This is absolutely not the case. Sufficient evidence exists to cast significant doubt on the 600 mph figure, as has been noted.

First, you're begging the question of whether Robertson's memory is faulty. Second, the fact that the towers did initially withstand those collisions is not evidence that they were intentionally designed to do so. It is possible that the strength required to withstand hurricane-force winds was greater than the strength required to resist such a collision, and that therefore the ability to absorb such impacts was merely incidental. In fact, this is suggested on p. 132 of City in the Sky.

The comparison is between crash tests and a building-performance evaluation, as examples of the engineering design process. Frankly, your comment is totally asinine, and not even worthy of a 9th-grade debating class.

The link is just a Google search for the terms "crash", "test", and "parameters".   Further, whatever it is you were trying to link does not change the fact that European and American crash-test standards are based on cars' traveling at about half their maximum speeds (or less).

Affirmed consequent fallacy. The fact that some engineering projects are designed to meet a certain "worst case" does not mean that all engineering projects are designed to meet a certain "worst case." Further, the telegram shown in DC's OP states that the towers were designed for wind loads of up to 45 pounds per square foot (psf). Yet a Category 5 hurricane can generate wind loads in excess of 81 psf (see  here  ). So please explain, if you would, Swing, why the designers didn't build the towers to withstand a Category 5 hurricane? After all, you claim that engineers always design for the "worst case."

The "600 mph" opinion was given in response to a lawsuit that was attempting to stop construction of the World Trade Center. Why do you assume that that claim is unbiased?

 

Swing Dangler, kindly answer the questions I've posed.

I'll recap them for your convenience:

First, please explain, in light of the Florida Supreme Court opinion that I quoted, why box cutters cannot be used as hijack weapons.

Second, please explain why the World Trade Center towers were not designed to withstand Category 4 or 5 hurricanes, if, as you contend, "engineers always design for the worst-case scenario."

Third, please explain why Robertson's purported fear of a lawsuit would have caused his opinion to be biased, but the "600 mph" opinion, which was actually given in response to a lawsuit, would not have been biased.

I accept the recognition of your mistake. Very noble of you I might add as most debunkers wouldn't dare admit to a mistake while discussing issues with a truther.

 
What's comical, frankly, is your breathtaking ignorance of both aviation and engineering.

V NE (Velocity Not to Exceed) is the velocity beyond which the aircraft will suffer structural damage in a clean configuration. V LE (Velocity with Landing gear Extended) is the velocity beyond which the aircraft will suffer structural damage if its landing gear is extended.

 
Lets tear this apart shall we.
1. Your suggesting the location of WTC determines how fast a plane will fly or worst yet the lack of a scenario where a plane would exceeed its parameters. Nonsense.
2. What was that speed above 25,000 feet?  
3. The cruise speed itself was 607mph. Don't you think that has any relevance to the 600mph number cited? IHMO, that is exactly
why the design was to resist 600mph. It matched the cruising speed of the largest plane at the time.
 
The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact.

 

That also explains why the buildings survived the initial impact quite well. Dam fireproofing....

3. Here is the problem you run into. They designed the buildings to withstand the collision with the largest passenger jet during that time period, but NOT at the top end speed of that plane? Yet the white paper closely matches the cruising speed of the plane. That of course makes complete engineering sense to me.

Now what we might agree on is what situation in which the cruising speed was exceeded by the pilots.

Lets examine some other comments: THE BUILDING AS DESIGNED IS SIXTEEN TIMES STIFFER THAN A CONVENTIONAL STRUCTURE. THE DESIGN CONCEPT IS SO SOUND THAT THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE IN HIS DESIGN WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMICS OF THE STRUCTURE.From the Roth Telegram.

 
You can laugh all you want, but you're only making yourself look even more ignorant, arrogant, and foolish. Please give an example of either pilot error or mechanical failure that would have resulted in a 707's flying (as opposed to crashing) at even 450 mph below 1500 feet AGL.

No the motive is accident or deliberate which can be cast aside of course and has no relevance to the conversation.

Can the jet fly 600 mph? Yes. Enough said. Your lack of imagination or your assumed lack of the structural engineering firm's imagination does not discredit the 600 mph figure.

 
Childish attempted derail noted. That aside, it would have been one crazed pilot against two other flight crew members, who possibly have assistance from the cabin crew.

Hmmmmm.   And, despite your attempt to belittle them, box cutters can cause very serious, and even fatal, wounds.

 
Not a derail attempt. It simply was a response to your post about a pilot fighting back against another pilot. Yet no description of a pilot fighting back occurs on 9/11. But we do read accounts of pilots being moved to the back of the plane.

 
So please explain, if you would, Swing, how box cutters can't be used as hijacking weapons.

 
Please link to where I stated box cutters can't be used as a hijacking weapon?

 
No. You can't come up with an "accident" scenario involving a 707 going anywhere near 600 mph below 1500 feet (except possibly straight down after some catastrophic failure or collision, in which case what building it hits is effectively random, and the height of the WTC is irrelevant), so you can't just change that aspect arbitrarily

 
I supposedly can't come up with an accident scenario however you just list one. Great logic there. Can the 707 travel 600 mph at 1500 feet or below? If so, there is your scenario.

 
This comment demonstrates a Hollywood-level knowledge of aviation. A plane loses gravitational potential energy when it descends, and this will be converted into kinetic energy.

 
Please describe the type of decent you are referring to? Are you suggesting limiting the decent rate via increased resistances or a reduction in velocity to support this statement?
And by the way, we weren't discussing potential energy upon decent, but the speed of decent.

 
But if the aircraft increases drag and/or decreases thrust sufficiently, it won't necessarily gain speed, especially if the dive is sufficiently shallow.

 
Well duh!

 
Further, air resistance increases as altitude decreases, thus increasing drag. And diving madly toward an airport will not result in a landing; the aircraft will simply be moving too fast to line up on the runway and land at the proper speed.

 
It will result in a landing...a crash landing. Of course we aren't discussing a landing approach only scenario.

 
An aircraft impact does not cause a blast by itself; impacts and explosions are very different events.

 
An airplane by itself without fuel wouldn't be much use in the air now would it?

 
Sometimes an explosion can occur incident to an air crash, but the great majority of damage is likely to be caused by kinetic energy from the aircraft, and subsequent fires from its fuel supply.

 
Precisely...that fuel supply.

 
This is absolutely not the case. Sufficient evidence exists to cast significant doubt on the 600 mph figure, as has been noted.

 
Really? Please site the engineering firm that corrected the 600 mph figure in their study. The burden of proof is on you.
The 600 mph figure has enough support: 1. The white paper. 2. The cruise speed of the 707. 3. 9/11.

 
First, you're begging the question of whether Robertson's memory is
faulty.

 
Nope. His own comments verify that.

 
Second, the fact that the towers did initially withstand
those collisions is not evidence that they were intentionally designed to do so.

 
Accidental engineering?  
It is not evidence that they were intentionally designed to do so? My goodness the white paper lists the 600 mph figure! I would argue that the Towers provide evidence that they were designed just as the white paper described and how the towers performed.

 
It is possible that the strength required to withstand hurricane-force winds was greater than the strength required to resist such a collision, and that therefore the ability to absorb such impacts was merely incidental. In fact, this is suggested on p. 132 of City in the Sky.

 
Or perhaps they designed it to withstand both as the Towers did.

You left this part out as well. Why?

 
The Vierendeel trusses would be so effective, according to the engineers' calculations, that all the columns on one side of a tower could be cut, as well as the two corners and several columns on the adjacent sides, and the tower would still be strong enough to withstand a 100-mile-per-hour wind.
--City in the Sky, p 133

 

 
The comparison is between crash tests and a building-performance evaluation, as examples of the engineering design process. Frankly, your comment is totally asinine, and not even worthy of a 9th-grade debating class.

 
Your character attack is noted as a dodge to the point that you can't counter. You suggested worst case scenarios are not consider in the design of buildings. I gave an example of how they are considered.

 
The link is just a Google search for the terms "crash", "test", and "parameters".   Further, whatever it is you were trying to link does not change the fact that European and American crash-test standards are based on cars' traveling at about half their maximum speeds (or less).

 
The link was suppose to point to a worst case design scenario where a building, a high rise structure, was being designed with a worst case fire in mind.
Do structural engineers and architects consider worst case scenarios when designing projects? I think you know the answer, thereby eliminating this entire point.

 
Affirmed consequent fallacy. The fact that some engineering projects are designed to meet a certain "worst case" does not mean that all engineering projects are designed to meet a certain "worst case." Further, the telegram shown in DC's OP states that the towers were designed for wind loads of up to 45 pounds per square foot (psf). Yet a Category 5 hurricane can generate wind loads in excess of 81 psf (see  here  ). So please explain, if you would, Swing, why the designers didn't build the towers to withstand a Category 5 hurricane? After all, you claim that engineers always design for the "worst case."

 
Please source where I stated ALL engineering projects are designed for the "worst case"? Thanks.
There is no need to discuss wind speed, as we are discussing the MPH figure of a plane's impact into the towers, not continuous wind. You can also refer to the analysis above.
As far as the winds peed design, I suppose you can't make an indestructible tower now can you?

 
The "600 mph" opinion was given in response to a lawsuit that was attempting to stop construction of the World Trade Center. Why do you assume that that claim is unbiased?

 
Please source where this number is an opinion and not fact? Thanks.
If you are suggesting the claim is a biased number, please cite the engineering study that led you to believe this or the results of the lawsuit that found the number to be in error. Thanks!

The burden of proof is upon you to prove that the claim was biased. Can you do that? If not will you retract that statement?
 
 
Cruising speed is 607mph? what would be the top speed then?

Let's say for the sake of argument that the claim was absolutely correct, that a thorough analysis was done and found that the towers could withstand a 600 mph collision without collapsing, even when fires are taken into account.

Given the fact that theoretical models are often proven wrong in practice, why is it not possible that this analysis was wrong? Thanks.

It would have been proven wrong had the towers collapsed due to impact alone. The events of the day substantiate the 600mph figure.
 
 
****buzzzer****** Wrong.
 
 
 
The events of the day substantiate the 600mph figure.

 
The events of the day suggest, but don't necessarily prove, that the towers would have survived the impact of a Boeing 707 travelling at 600mph absent a fuel-initiated fire. They don't in any way substantiate the suggestion that a calaulation was done in 1964 that resulted in a prediction that the towers would have survived the impact of a Boeing 707 travelling at 600mph. And what they least of all substantiate is that there might be anything suspicious about the response of the towers had such a result been obtained. Having said which, can this issue be in any way related to the compilation of evidence in favour of a new enquiry any more, or is it simply a meaningless attempt to score points off a group you see as your rivals?

What swing is saying is that the fact that the buildings were hit by 600mph planes and collapsed substantiates the claim that the buildings were designed so they wouldn't collapse if hit by 600mph planes.

One, I did not claim the 9/11 planes were hit by 600 mph planes.

Two, who was responsible for fire proofing?

1. Good point. The planes weren't 707's.
2. I would suggest, albet without direct evidence, that his study did contain the calculations.

 
THE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT BY THE FIRM OF WORTHINGTON, SKILLING, HELLE & JACKSON IS THE MOST COMPLETE AND DETAILED OF ANY EVER MADE FOR ANY BUILDING STRUCTURE. THE PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS ALONE COVER 1,200 PAGES AND INVOLVE OVER 100 DETAILED DRAWINGS.

 
3. Is it common for engineering firms who building skyscrappers to make statements and assessments that do not have a basis in mathematical calculations or do you think it would be rather uncommon for a firm to not provide calculations supporting their structure's design?

Who needs evidence when you've got the trooooth? Evidence just gets in the way.

I like his application of higher level mathematics: "Well Duh!" is clearly an exotic expression of symbolic logic. ETA: above #434.
