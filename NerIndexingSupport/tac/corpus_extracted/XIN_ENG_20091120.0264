Ugandan rally driver Posiano Lwakataka has registered his two sons for the
Mbarara Motor Club (MMC) Super Sprint slated for November 29 at the Festino Cite
in Mukono, local media reported on Friday.

MMC coordinator Saeed Kakeeto was quoted by the state-owned New Vision daily
saying that 11-year-old Amis Bukenya will be navigated by his 10-year-old
brother Paddy Kafeero in a Toyota Levin.

"We are aware that the law bars juveniles from driving. But we shall seek
permission from the police licensing department to allow them like we did at
Botanical Gardens," said Kakeeto.

The boys practiced at Lubiri circuit on Thursday and vowed to put up a good show
at Festino.

"They will drive as a festive team. This is meant to encourage other drivers to
train their children and promote the sport," he added.

According to Lwakataka, the only way of having good rally drivers is by getting
talent at an early age and builds their confidence.

"Zimbabwean driver Conrad Rautenbach started driving at an early age and at 19
years he was featuring in the world championships," noted the father of the two
boys.

So far, twenty seven drivers including Lwakataka himself have registered for the
rally.
