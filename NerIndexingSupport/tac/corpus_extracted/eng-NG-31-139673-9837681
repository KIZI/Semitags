Hello Cameron,

FSRecorder is a great little utility for saving your flights for
playback later.

You can even record whilst flying, save it and play it back as an AI
aircraft whilst flying beside yourself. Â Its good for creating
formation flying videos.
It works better than the default recording but still wont record as an
independant video format.
