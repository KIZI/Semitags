 
 
An Observation
 
 
Most of those that claim to be for 'peace' whatever the conflict, in fact are just for the 'other side.'
 
 
Did you mean your OP as a joke, Annie?

I disagree.

As far as the Palestinian and Israel conflict, for example, I'd like to see a Palestinian state and the state of Israel living in peace and cooperating to avoid further conflict.

I find the loss of people's lives on both sides equally tragic and agonizing.

I'm rooting for peace. Israel has a right to exist. Palestine has a right to exist. The Palestinians need to replace Hamas before there can be any significant peace making in the region. JMO.
 
 
 
I'm rooting for peace.

 

Right. But which side is 'wrong?'
 
 
What makes you think it has to be one side is wrong and the other is right? They've both made mistakes. Both sides have legitimate claim to the ancestral land.

The land is sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians.
 
 
Anyone for peace would find particular acts wrong, not particular sides, it seems to me.

Possibly certain acts are being condemned and you are translating it into certain sides being condemned?

I haven't followed the Gaza threads though, been too busy elsewhere.

Exactly. Both sides are not acting peacefully. They are committing acts of attack and retaliation.

The aggressive acts are what need to be condemned, not the sides.
 
 
 
Fine, which side has the 'most' mistakes?

 

I get the idea that you think there is some score card somewhere keeping track of which side is making the most mistakes. Is God keeping track?

I get the feeling you have a side, and my guess is that you favor Israel. Is that correct?

I do not favor Israel over Palestine or vice versa.
 
 
 
Exactly. Both sides are not acting peacefully. They are committing acts of attack and retaliation.

The aggressive acts are what need to be condemned, not the sides.

 

Again, for both of you, which side is 'more wrong' or is at war for the wrong reasons?

Simple hog wash. Israel allowed missiles to rain down on her for a WEEK. Then she responded by attacking ONLY military targets. Further Israel allowed for 6 months the same missiles to strike her over and over while she kept the truce.
 
 
 
Again, for both of you, which side is 'more wrong' or is at war for the wrong reasons?

 

Why don't you answer that for yourself? It's not so simple IMO. Both sides have long histories. It's complex. Where would we begin to look at the cause of this conflict? In the short term? 1949? 2000-4000 years ago?

We, Americans, tend to have a short attention span and we don't always value long term history.

I recommend the book by Madeline Albright called THE MIGHTY AND THE ALMIGHTY. She takes a dispassionate view of the Arab Israeli confict and religious wars in general.

If you want to discuss this specific event, fine. The OP was asking the question rhetorically and I responded in kind.

It's not hogwash. It's just a general view. If you want to talk specifics we can. Those tend to be somewhat endless.

Right. But which side is 'wrong?'

 

The flaw of the warmonger... thinking one side has to be right and the other wrong instead of just allowing for people to be people.
 
 
 
Most of those that claim to be for 'peace' whatever the conflict, in fact are just for the 'other side.'

 

I think that's true in some cases. When someone starts a fight and they get their butt kicked, they know that if they play the victim they'll get sympathy from somebody. Then, of course, there are those who truly want peace. That reminds me of an X-File episode where Fox Moulder wished for world peace and everyone on the planet disappeared.

Isn't Annie asking who is the real victim? Who is in the right?
 
 
 
Again, for both of you, which side is 'more wrong' or is at war for the wrong reasons?

 

The question simply does not apply. The closest question that would apply is which act is more wrong, of all the acts.

To my way of thinking that is like asking which type of sin, among all sins, is worst. I think you are catholic, if I recall, and this particular question doesn't make sense, right? Besides dividing into venial and mortal sins, in general sins are to be avoided as best as one can.

It does explain a lot.

She's very nice. And she is a teacher.

Annie, I only recall it vaguely from one thread, and I have senior moments. I am sorry if I blew any sort of cover that you had.  
 
 
I haven't noticed how 'nice' she is. I'll have to take your word for it. She hasn't taken my olive branch.
 
 
 
It does explain a lot.

 

Yes but if pagans are superior surely you can demonstrate it? <wicked>
 
 
Catholics. They're always right, even when they're wrong.

There's the flaw that many have... most pagans know that no one life form is superior... better at some things but worse at others. Any pagan who thinks they are superior in all things is just like a... well... christian and therefore not pagan but agnostic who claims to be pagan.
 
 
 
Catholics. They're always right, even when they're wrong.

 

LOL Yes we are. And when we disagree, we're both right.

I'm rooting for peace. Israel has a right to exist. Palestine has a right to exist. The Palestinians need to replace Hamas before there can be any significant peace making in the region. JMO.

 

I ask this as non-confrontational as I can.

Why do you feel Palestine has the right to exist? Palestine, literally means Land of Phillistines. Phillistines were Mediterianin -- not Arab.

This is not an opinion. This is a fact.

Why do the Arabs need yet another country? What's wrong with the ones they have?

The Arab world (Arabic: العالم العربي; Transliteration: al-`alam al-`arabi) is a term to define all of the Arabic-speaking countries stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. It consists of about 20 countries and territories with a combined population of some 325 million people spanning two continents.

1: Kuwait (Kuwait)
2: Iraq (Bagdad)
3: Kingdom of Sudia Arabia (Riyadh)

Really? You're the first Catholic I've ever known to say the other side may have a point.

 

I may say that but secretly I know that I am right      
 
 
Of course you're right. You're Catholic.
 
 
 
What makes you think it has to be one side is wrong and the other is right? They've both made mistakes. No sides have legitimate claim to a large plot of sand.

The land is sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians.

 

I fixed it for you, you can see that in the bolded parts.

Nobody has a right to any land. AND if anyone even did then it would be the Native Americans when it comes to America.

Anyone willing to give up their home right now?
 
 
 
Fine, which side has the 'most' mistakes?

 

I don't like how you're trying to find a "right" and a "wrong" side here Annie.

If Israel truly wanted to get rid of Hamas and his missile attacks, they would of gone to the UN and told them they are going to invade the land Hamas controls and get rid of them.

Both sides are wrong, both sides have killed innocent civilians. Neither side is fighting for freedom because either side could of left the land long ago. It's simply due to religion that many of the people even want to claim a piece of sand land in the desert.

Both sides have their screwballs (Sunni Man and David come to mind here) and both sides are out to get the best result for their own side.

We both know these attacks will not cease until one side is dead. This is war, however it is not a black and white picture. It is a picture full of grey.
 
 
 
LOL Yes we are. And when we disagree, we're both right.

 

God's will right?  
 
 
FYI everybody: America only supports Israel because they are our foothold in the Middle East.

Which is why Israel despite being one of the more smaller nations has some of the best weapons in the world.

Nobody on either side could deny the fact that if not for America then Israel would be nowhere near where it is today.

Sure, some countries have the weapons amount to give to Israel but not the quality of weapons or the diplomatic support the U.S holds.

(I'm not saying this means Israel should/should not exist, I'm simply stating facts).

And if not the reason I listed above then why?

Because we feel they are being unjustly attacked? If that were the case then how come we're not in Darfur stopping the genocides going on there? Or the other genocides of years past? In fact, America and the rest of the world only stepped in to stop Hitler's Genocide of the Jews, Atheists, and anyone who disagreed with him in Germany because Germany and Japan invaded their countries.

The rest of the world sat idle by while Hitler committed Genocide.

So lets see, why else could it be?

Because we like their flag? Their national anthem? Because we liked their windsurfing team that won a gold medal in the 2004 olympics?

Gee, I do believe I'm right.
 
 
 
But you are rooting for?

 

omg this is hardly the op i wanted to see on new year's day...when did peace become a bad and evil thing?

wanting peace does not mean you are "rooting for the other side" again when did americans...become so selective in their horrors?

i would hope for peace for the world...so who am i rooting for...the parents...the kids....the littlest of creatures...to have what we all want for ourselves and our loved ones....a safe secure home, a place to work and a place for your family to grow and prosper...if that wrong?

peace is not rooting for one side over another...it is hoping for both sides..or has that been lost too?

That's why I keep bringing up strengthening the United Nations, and eliminating warring implements held by nations. Anyone who has any sense can see that warring is no longer a viable option to settling differences.
 
 
 
FYI everybody:

Gee, I do believe I'm right.

 

Robert, are you Catholic?  
 
 
 
And if not the reason I listed above then why?

 

One of the biggest reasons was religious reasons. The Christians believe that the creation of Israel will bring about the building of the 3rd temple and the return of Jesus, or as Jews would put it, the coming of the messiah for the first time.

But, yes, you're right, it is to have a diplomatic foothold in the middle east, and it certainly helps with the Jewish vote politically here in the US.
 
 
 
Most of those that claim to be for 'peace' whatever the conflict, in fact are just for the 'other side.'

 

You've observed this, have you?

So like if somebody says to you: " Peace on earth and goodwill toward men "

You assume they're what? Martians or something?

See my point?

What is "the other side" ??

Actually, the U.S. didn't always support Israel. Initially, we and the Brits refused to give weapons to the Jews while the Soviets were giving weapons to the Arab populations. Israel still won. And, FWIW, we give money and weapons to Arab countries too. No one gets offended by that.

What I will say, is that sometimes we should just do the right thing, though I don't suspect for a second that nations do that frequently.

There is a flip side to your argument... the U.S. needs to get oil independent so we stop giving money to governments that fund terrorists who hate us.

This fantasy that terrorists would be nice to us if we would just toss Israel under the bus is just silliness. Fundamentalists who work with the goal of making the world in their image or killing everyone else in the process don't respond to huggy feely stuff.
 
 
 
Most of those that claim to be for 'peace' whatever the conflict, in fact are just for the 'other side.'

 

So unless one champions Israel, they can't be for peace in your opinion?

Surely you aren't serious.
 
 
 
So deep or avoiding? Doesn't matter, the number of posts make it clear.

 

Yet YOU won't answer the qusetion yourself. You're admonishing others for not answering a question you won't answer.

Kinda' makes your question silly and irrelevent.

It appears that "peace" is not your objective.
 
 
I am so damned sick of the whole Isreal/Palestinian question.

You people are obsessed.

Navigating between the unreasonable NAZIs and the unreasonable Zionists is a real pain the ass, you know?

Do you suppose it might be possible that every thread not be turned into still another place where you two opposing camps say the same damned thing over and over again?

It'd be nice.

Frankly, it's a good thing that the Isreal/Palestine question has taken center stage. America avoids this discussion like a disease.. yet we pay dearly for our bigoted support for Israel.

I'll ask again the question that zionists run from..

QUESTION:.. What are the benefits of our undeniably biased support for Israel bringing to America and the American people that outweigh the tremendous costs of that support?

Costs such as,

Billions and billions of DWINDLING US taxpayer dollars pouring into Israel.. which was just increased by 25% in 2007 and with Barack Obama promising to increase military aid to Israel by another five billion dollars when he takes office.

Growing resentment against the United States all over the world and proving to the world that the problem with America ain't George Bush.... a world we are increasingly dependent on.

Exponentially increasing the rise of terrorism, and in fact, giving support to those who use it.

Giving support to more radical elements in the arab world, thus endangering moderate leaders by giving a stronger voice less US friendly opposition.

Creating a greater divide between the EU and the US.

Opening the door to Russia, China, and the SCO to make gains in trade, treaties, and military cooperation throughout the middle east, far east, Africa, and even in South America.. and makes them appear friendlier and more acceptable in some cases to the EU.

AND, not the least of which, endangering the lives of American soldiers fighting in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. Does anybody believe situations in both wars didn't just suddenly become more dangerous? Does anybody believe that those elements our troops are fighting aren't seeing a boon in their recruitment?

These are sane questions that will have to be answered. America can no longer afford to be Israel's bitch.. but I'm betting the zionists will run away and avoid answering again.
 
 
 
Most of those that claim to be for 'peace' whatever the conflict, in fact are just for the 'other side.'

 

Interesting observation. I'd tend to agree. Back someone far enough into a corner and eventually they will reveal a preference or at least a sympathy for one side or another. In most cases anyway.
 
 
ok--this crap couldn't go on for years liek this unless someone is benefitting from it. Only chance I see stopping it is to take on those benefittnig from contant mideast turmoil.
 
 
 
Frankly, it's a good thing that the Isreal/Palestine question has taken center stage. America avoids this discussion like a disease.. yet we pay dearly for our bigoted support for Israel.

 

No it's not.

Want to know why?

Because this question takes all the oxygen out of the room because the opposing camps are fucking crazy with hate and fear and frankly, they're both either ractist or ethnocentrists who make ration discussions about this subject im- fucking -possible.

And this happens every damned time that Isreal is having problems keeping the Palestinians on the reservation and NOTHING ever gets resolves.

This is a family squabble that infects our nation.

America is facing REAL PROBLEMS that make the whole issue of Israel/Palestine issue mighty small potatoes by comparison.

If Israel cesased to exist would any of OUR PROBLEMS be solved?

No, they would not.

And if the Palestinians ceased to exist, would any of OUR PROBLEMS be solved?

No, they would not.

We., the US of A's masters of the universe created most of the problems we are facing.

DDon't blame the Jews.

Don't blame the Palestinians, either.

They are BOTH convenient scapegoats our masters use to explain a lot of the problems we have in foreign affairs and that, my friend, is largely BULLSHIT.

It's bullshit when some terrorist trys to tell us that it's all about Israel, and it's bullshit when our leaders try to tell us it's all about Israel, too.

It's about EVERYTHING that the West and the Arab world have going on.

It's about a long stormy history of two civilizations colliding of which Isreal is but the lightening rod.
 
 
Annie,

Here's an observation for you that blows your "you're either with us or against us" illogic completely away.

The following humble suggestions are based on my seventy years of experience as an underground fighter, special forces soldier in the 1948 war, editor-in-chief of a newsmagazine, member of the Knesset and founding member of a peace movement:

A Memo to Obama on Israel Israeli/Palestinian Conflict

Uri Avnery: The following humble suggestions are based on my 70 years of experience as an underground fighter, member of the Knesset and founding member of a peace movement in Israel.
1) As far as Israeli-Arab peace is concerned, you should act from Day One.

2) Israeli elections are due to take place in February 2009. You can have an indirect but important and constructive impact on the outcome, by announcing your unequivocal determination to achieve Israeli-Palestinian, Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-all-Arab peace in 2009.

3) Unfortunately, all your predecessors since 1967 have played a double game. While paying lip service to peace, and sometimes going through the motions of making some effort for peace, they have in practice supported our governments in moving in the very opposite direction. In particular, they have given tacit approval to the building and enlargement of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian and Syrian territories, each of which is a land mine on the road to peace.

4) All the settlements are illegal in international law. The distinction sometimes made between "illegal" outposts and the other settlements is a propaganda ploy designed to obscure this simple truth.

5) All the settlements since 1967 have been built with the express purpose of making a Palestinian state--and hence peace--impossible, by cutting the territory of the prospective State of Palestine into ribbons. Practically all our government departments and the army have openly or secretly helped to build, consolidate and enlarge the settlements--as confirmed by the 2005 report prepared for the government by lawyer Talia Sasson.

6) By now, the number of settlers in the West Bank has reached some 250,000 (apart from the 200,000 settlers in the Greater Jerusalem area, whose status is somewhat different). They are politically isolated, and sometimes detested by the majority of the Israel public, but enjoy significant support in the army and government ministries.

7) No Israeli government would dare to confront the concentrated political and material might of the settlers. Such a confrontation would need very strong leadership and the unstinting support of the President of the United States to have any chance of success.

8) Lacking these, all "peace negotiations" are a sham. The Israeli government and its US backers have done everything possible to prevent the negotiations with both the Palestinians and the Syrians from reaching any conclusion, for fear of provoking a confrontation with the settlers and their supporters. The present "Annapolis" negotiations are as hollow as all the preceding ones, each side keeping up the pretense for its own political interests.

9) The Clinton administration, and even more so the Bush administration, allowed the Israeli government to keep up this pretense. It is therefore imperative to prevent members of these administrations from diverting your Middle Eastern policy into the old channels.

10) It is important for you to make a complete new start, and to state this publicly. Discredited ideas and failed initiatives--such as the Bush "vision," the Road Map, Annapolis and the like--should be thrown into the junkyard of history.

11) To make a new start, the aim of American policy should be stated clearly and succinctly. This should be: to achieve a peace based on the two-state solution within a defined time span (say, by the end of 2009).

12) It should be pointed out that this aim is based on a reassessment of the American national interest, in order to extract the poison from American-Arab and American-Muslim relations, strengthen peace-oriented regimes, defeat Al Qaeda-type terrorism, end the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and achieve a viable accommodation with Iran.

13) The terms of Israeli-Palestinian peace are clear. They have been crystallized in thousands of hours of negotiations, conferences, meetings and conversations. They are:

13.1) A sovereign and viable State of Palestine will be established side by side with the State of Israel.

13.2) The border between the two states will be based on the pre-1967 Armistice Line (the "Green Line"). Insubstantial alterations can be arrived at by mutual agreement on an exchange of territories on a 1:1 basis.

13.3) East Jerusalem, including the Haram-al-Sharif ("Temple Mount") and all Arab neighborhoods will serve as the capital of Palestine. West Jerusalem, including the Western Wall and all Jewish neighborhoods, will serve as the capital of Israel. A joint municipal authority, based on equality, may be established by mutual consent to administer the city as one territorial unit.

13.4) All Israeli settlements--except any which might be joined to Israel in the framework of a mutually agreed exchange of territories-- will be evacuated (see 15 below).

13.5) Israel will recognize in principle the right of the refugees to return. A Joint Commission for Truth and Reconciliation, composed of Palestinian, Israeli and international historians, will examine the events of 1948 and 1967 and determine who was responsible for what. Each individual refugee will be given the choice between (1) repatriation to the State of Palestine, (2) remaining where he/she is living now and receiving generous compensation, (3) returning to Israel and being resettled, (4) emigrating to any other country, with generous compensation. The number of refugees who will return to Israeli territory will be fixed by mutual agreement, it being understood that nothing will be done that materially alters the demographic composition of the Israeli population. The large funds needed for the implementation of this solution must be provided by the international community in the interest of world peace. This will save much of the money spent today on military expenditure and direct grants from the United States.

13.6) The West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip constitute one national unit. An extraterritorial connection (road, railway, tunnel or bridge) will connect the West Bank with the Gaza Strip.

13.7) Israel and Syria will sign a peace agreement. Israel will withdraw to the pre-1967 line and all settlements on the Golan Heights will be dismantled. Syria will cease all anti-Israeli activities conducted directly or by proxy. The two parties will establish normal relations between them.

13.8) In accordance with the Saudi Peace Initiative, all member states of the Arab League will recognize Israel and establish normal relations with it. Talks about a future Middle Eastern Union, on the model of the EU, possibly to include Turkey and Iran, may be considered.

14) Palestinian unity is essential for peace. Peace made with only one section of the people is worthless. The US will facilitate Palestinian reconciliation and the unification of Palestinian structures. To this end, the US will end its boycott of Hamas, which won the last elections, start a political dialogue with the movement and encourage Israel to do the same. The US will respect any result of democratic Palestinian elections.

15) The US will aid the government of Israel in confronting the settlement problem. As from now, settlers will be given one year to leave the occupied territories voluntarily in return for compensation that will allow them to build their homes in Israel proper. After that, all settlements--except those within any areas to be joined to Israel under the peace agreement--will be evacuated.

16) I suggest that you, as president of the United States, come to Israel and address the Israeli people personally, not only from the rostrum of the Knesset but also at a mass rally in Tel-Aviv's Rabin Square. President Anwar Sadat of Egypt came to Israel in 1977, and, by addressing the Israeli people directly, completely changed their attitude towards peace with Egypt. At present, most Israelis feel insecure, uncertain and afraid of any daring peace initiative, partly because of a deep distrust of anything coming from the Arab side. Your personal intervention, at the critical moment, could literally do wonders in creating the psychological basis for peace.
 A Memo to Obama on Israel 

Uri Avnery is a veteran of Israel's 1948 war, a former Member of the Knesset, founder of the Gush Shalom peace movement and winner of the 2001 Right Livelihood Award, often called the "alternative Nobel Peace Prize." His book "1948: A Soldier's Tale, the Bloody Road to Jerusalem," which was published in Hebrew soon after the 1948 war and was a bestseller in Israel, has just been translated into English for the first time by Oneworld Publications.

The flaw in the your argument is there are ever-growing JEWISH voices against the macinations of the zionist government.
 
 
 
No it's not.

Because this question takes all the oxygen out of the room because the opposing camps are fucking crazy with hate and fear and frankly, they're both either ractist or ethnocentrists who make ration discussions about this subject im- fucking -possible.

DDon't blame the Jews.

Don't blame the Palestinians, either.

They are BOTH convenient scapegoats our masters use to explain a lot of the problems we have in foreign affairs and that, my friend, is largely BULLSHIT.

It's bullshit when some terrorist trys to tell us that it's all about Israel, and it's bullshit when our leaders try to tell us it's all about Israel, too.

It's about EVERYTHING that the West and the Arab world have going on.

It's about a long stormy history of two civilizations colliding of which Isreal is but the lightening rod.

 

Irrespective of how you see the problems, avoiding the discussions will not make them go away. That's not what mature and intelligent people do.

Are the questions difficult?.. Absolutely.. but avoiding them because they're difficult does not in my opinion solve anything.

Will situations get better if we don't talk about them?

What about the tremendous costs that America pays for it's biased support of Israel.. can we afford to just keep paying these costs ad infinitum?

I completely disagree and I remind you of something someone wise once told me.. SILENCE IS FAILURE

Nor will anything we say here make them go away.

 
That's not what mature and intelligent people do.

 

What mature people do when they reach an impasse in a debate is acknowledge that there isn't enough common ground to find a solution or reach a conclusion, BAC.

The don't do this because they have relented or because the problem isn't important, but because all they;re doing by continuing to insult each other is make it worse.

 
Are the questions difficult?.. Absolutely.. but avoiding them because they're difficult does not in my opinion solve anything.

 

Is there a single argument on either side which you or I have not heard, discussed to death and found unresolvable?

I don't think so. I've been involved in these debates about Isreal for years and years and I have never seem them create anything but hard feelings.

And I cannot help but note that the people who most often start these discussion have no desire to discuss issues rationally, but merely uses these discussion to insult others, try to hurt other people's feelings, and spead their messages of hate and racism and ethnocentrism.

 
Will situations get better if we don't talk about them?

 

Most of us cannot talk about them.

We insult one another pretending that by doing so, we're discussing the issues

 
What about the tremendous costs that America pays for it's biased support of Israel.. can we afford to just keep paying these costs ad infinitum?

 

America's OTHER problems will make our continued support of Israel unlikely. A broke nation isn't a very good ally, is it?

 
I completely disagree and I remind you of something someone wise once told me.. SILENCE IS FAILURE

 

And going over the same racist paths we have been going over, navigating our way around the racist/hnocentrists who seek to destabilize RATIONAL DISCUSSION about this issue is worse than failure...it exascerbates the problem.

All I see happening here is this "issue" becomes a platform for NAZIs to spew their vile poison about Jews, and for ZIONISTS to spew their hateful assults on Palestinians.

I see nothing good coming from this on THIS BOARD because there are so many crypto NAZIs and people who love Isreal more than the nation which sustains them.

Until people learn to compromise, I agree.
 
 
 
Yet YOU won't answer the qusetion yourself. You're admonishing others for not answering a question you won't answer.

Kinda' makes your question silly and irrelevent.

It appears that "peace" is not your objective.

 

BAC, I don't think it's a secret that I favor Israel, I think they've been the victim more often than the aggressor. I think your posts show that you feel the opposite, which is certainly your prerogative and it's obvious you've arrived at your position logically, as have I mine. We choose to emphasize different factors to arrive at our positions, which is really the basis of making a compromise of some sort down the line, IF we had any influence on the situation.

My 'observation' was about those who keep saying, "They both have done wrongs, they both kill, they both lie, they both...." Eventually, when pressed they'll say, "but,...... has to do......", that was what I was referring to. Trying to find some relevancy in this situation is what is silly. I find what the Palestinians and current/former allies have done worthy of Israel's reaction, first regarding checkpoints, later the retaliation for missiles. You find Israel's refusal to remove the checkpoints, wall a convincing argument for subsequent Palestinian terror.

Citing individuals, whether Jewish or not, former IDF military leaders or not, as the basis for what 'should happen, well it would be as effective as if my or your ideas were implemented. No, at some point the terrorists will have to give up terrorism, Israel is going to have to give up some lands, but not without a clear agreement that if that results in more of the same, what they take from that point on, will be theirs. Or something to that effect. Neither side is there yet.
 
 
 
Robert, are you Catholic?  

 

Yes, I would be.

But I don't support people who use religion as a way to justify their wars, genocides, and murders among other crimes against humanity.

Actually that was a joke, meant from earlier posts about 'Catholics always believe they have the truth or are right.'  
 
 
 
One of the biggest reasons was religious reasons. The Christians believe that the creation of Israel will bring about the building of the 3rd temple and the return of Jesus, or as Jews would put it, the coming of the messiah for the first time.

But, yes, you're right, it is to have a diplomatic foothold in the middle east, and it certainly helps with the Jewish vote politically here in the US.

 

Mind showing me that source?

And to be honest, so many people in the U.S. in power who saw this as a huge opportunity for the U.S. didn't give a fuck about Israel and the jews who live there.

Otherwise, we would of stepped in and stopped Hitler alot earlier huh?
 
 
 
Actually that was a joke, meant from earlier posts about 'Catholics always believe they have the truth or are right.'

Oh yeah, all Catholics think the 'same.' Right.  
 
 
 
Actually, the U.S. didn't always support Israel. Initially, we and the Brits refused to give weapons to the Jews while the Soviets were giving weapons to the Arab populations. Israel still won. And, FWIW, we give money and weapons to Arab countries too. No one gets offended by that.

What I will say, is that sometimes we should just do the right thing, though I don't suspect for a second that nations do that frequently.

There is a flip side to your argument... the U.S. needs to get oil independent so we stop giving money to governments that fund terrorists who hate us.

This fantasy that terrorists would be nice to us if we would just toss Israel under the bus is just silliness. Fundamentalists who work with the goal of making the world in their image or killing everyone else in the process don't respond to huggy feely stuff.

 

I'm first going to ask: Can you read?

Not to sound rude but:

I said where it would be today, not that it supported Israel at first. Though it is true that we have always given them aid since 1948.

We don't give nearly the amount we give to the arab countries that we give to Israel. Besides, there are plenty of reasons we give arab countries money. Unrelated example, we give Columbia lots of money to fight the drug cartels there (though none of it probably goes to actually fighting but helping).

Again, you either went off on your own rant or totally took my words out of context. I don't believe this conflict would end if we threw Israel under the bus. But don't bullshit me in the reasons we help them.

It's purely political and military reasons. Not out of the goodness of our damn hearts.

Besides, who are WE to say any nation has a right to exist? We came here, took the land from the Indians and then people like John Hancock who were smugglers didn't want to get taxed heavily by the British and wanted to leave British Rule. Let us not forget men like Benjamin Franklin and George Washington who wanted to go west and take over the indian lands there, but the british didn't want them to.

No nation has a right to exist. Not Palestine, Israel, America, or any other country.

And religion because one's God "says" that those people have a right to the land over all others is bullshit.

In every religion, doesn't God love all his children (us) equally? If that is true, then why the fuck is he sitting there picking out his favorite group of people supposedly?
 
 
 
The flaw of the warmonger... thinking one side has to be right and the other wrong instead of just allowing for people to be people.

 

Yep. Both sides have valid points. Both sides can be criticized for certain actions.

That said, the Israelis have the legal right to Israel and the Palestinians are basically shit out of luck.

Did I miss the trial where this was decided?
 
 
"It would be wrong to try to use this history to determine "who is right," though many "histories" have certainly been written by partisans of either side, with precisely that purpose in mind. Those who are interested in advocacy, in collecting "points" for their side, cannot find the truth except by accident. If they find it, and it is inconvenient, they will bury it again. This account intends to inform, and nothing more. Two separate documents explain how I think we should gather facts and learn about the conflict, and the importance of words in making Middle East history, as well as in understanding it. A timeline provides details of many events not discussed in this history, and source documents provide additional background. Serious students will also refer to the bibliography for more information and different viewpoints, and will always seek out primary source documents to verify whatever claims are made about those documents or about quotes from those documents."

 Brief History of of Palestine, Israel and the Israeli Palestinian Conflict (Arab-Israeli conflict, Middle East Conflict) 
 
 
 
Did I miss the trial where this was decided?

 

The trial is a trial by combat and terrorism and it has been happening for about 60 years.

Damned shame, too.

Imagine what that land might have become had the European Jews and Palestinians found -- as many of them had done already, before the fucking Zionists and fucking Islamisists turned it into a civil war based on ethnics-- a way to live together in peace.

But no...Palestine had to become the Jewish Homeland, ergo the Palestinians, (much like the AmerInidans) had to get out of the way.

Sadly, the Arabs are still in the way 60 years later.

No no no no! They didn't have to get out of the way. They had to live side by side. The Arabs steadfastly refused to do that.

Go look up the nazi Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.
 
 
 
No no no no! They didn't have to get out of the way. They had to live side by side. The Arabs steadfastly refused to do that.

Jillian, it looks like the propaganda war is all but won by the Arabs. Seems there will not be any coverage of the other side. There was a reason Channel 4 put Ahmadinejad on for Christmas message.

And there's the fact that even many educated people like to hear only from the 'downtrodden.' The facts of 'why' they are in that position? They like hearing it's due to the oppression of those who pretend to be 'good.'

Spoils of war.

They steadfastly refused to allow the European Jews to move in (en masse) in the first place, Jillian.

The Ababs of Palestine made it perfectly clear they didn't want to become a European colony the moment the Balfour Declaration was made public.

The Zionists of Europe knew perfectly well they were not welcome there.

And so, much like European colonialists for the last 500 years, they came anyway and began the process of driving the original occupants off their own land.

There is essantially no moral difference between Israell, and the United States.

Morally and ethically, neither nation has a leg to stand on.

The major difference between the USA and Isreal now is simply that Israel, cannot simply exterminate the majority of the Palestinians to make that indigenous population problem go away.

The time for the European Zionists to have established their colony in the land formerly known as Israel, would have been in the 17th - 19th century, but of course back then, Europe couldn't dominate the Islamic world, could it?

And it looks to me like European and American and Zionist power still cannot dominate the Arab-Islamic world, either.

You and I both know damned well, that Palestinians could not continue this civil war without the covert or overt aide of their fellow Arab (and a few Islanice, but not Arab) nations.

So basically Israel is the lightening rod, the surrogate war serving as the clash of the Western v Islamic-Arab civilizations.

The Jews of Isreal, and the Arabs of Palestine are pawns in the grander game of world geo-politics, Jillian.

It annoys the crap out me, when the NAZIs balme this whole mess on the Jews.

They give England and France a complete pass when those two nations have the majoroty responsibility for the mess.

Of course at this stage of the game, the Isrealis have NO CHOICE but to fight and continue fighting.

What many of the boards Zionists sympathizers refuse to acknowledge is that the Palestinians don't really much choice, either.

Look at how the majo9rity of Palestinian refugees from the war of 48 are STILL living, JILLIAN.

THAT is entirely the fault of the Isreali government.

Not the arbas, not the American not the birts, but the Isrealis who decided that anyone who left their home, whether at gun point or by choice, any arab who abandone their homes while that CIVIL WAR and INVASION by the ARba states was happening LOST their property rights, and THEIR RIGHT TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES.

Nobboy but the Zionists can be blames for that policy, Jill.

That ethnocentrism cannot be blamed on anybody else.

So to whine that the poor Isrealis just want to live in peace is a lie.

The Isreali government will STILL will not acknowledge the property rights of the vast majority of Palestinians.
 
 
Imagine for a minute native Americans deciding to retake the USA using terror tactics...they'd all be vaporized in a heartbeat.

I see nothing good coming from this on THIS BOARD because there are so many crypto NAZIs and people who love Isreal more than the nation which sustains them.

 

Perhaps our different views on this come from my being I'm older then you good brother. I've lived the civil rights era and if you think the differences are wide on Israel imagine what they were on race in this country. Although the internet wasn't yet alive, there were plenty of mediums and opportunities for people to express their views. Ultimately, through all the hundreds of years of a racist culture, intelligence began to break through the noise. America was forced to take a hard look at itself because the conversations would not stop, would not just go away.

We should never allow the percieved extremes to dictate society of what should or should not be discussed. I say "percieved" extremes because what one sees as extreme another sees as a critical element of the discussion. Again, race is a prime example.

Additionally, why run from the extremes? If a position is indeed extreme, shouldn't a more proper position be able to demonstrate its logical soundness, particularly when compared to the extreme?

In my opinion, what is demonstrated about this issue even here on this board.. even through the noise.. is those who profess this undying love of Israel before the best interests of their own country cannot intelligently support their position, cannot answer the critical question of how this benefits America, and hide behind the mask of "anti-semitism." I've posted the thoughts of JEWISH thinkers who support the same position of Israel that the vast majority of the world support. They're only answer is to call other Jews "self-loathing" and to claim the entire planet is "anti-semitic."

I'm obviously getting more from these discussions than you are, but I'm sure there are other people who come away with the same. There is a reason why this discussion has been censored in America.. and that reason is because there is no logic that supports our position in the ME.

Or something to that effect. Neither side is there yet.

 

I don't disagree with much of what you've said here.. however, citing Jewish indiviuals, particularly former IDF military leaders, demonstrates the fallacy of the "antisemitism", "self-loathing" arguments. It clears the air and forces the conversation towards dealing with the issue based on facts and merit, not the evasion of shooting the messenger. It's much easier to label me anti-semitic and run from the message than it is to dismiss the thoughts of some of those I've posted. It's easier to call Chomsky "self-loathing" than it is to label a former IDF leader as such.

You speak of peace, but I see no peace coming from your side.. which even condemns helping Palestinian women and children. All I see coming from Israel is defiance and a belief that they are above all the rest of the world. Where is the intelligence in that? Where are any long-term prospects for peace to be found in that posture? Where is peace to be found when you're the most hated nation on earth?

If you would, please answer my question of how our undeniably biased position on the ME benefits America and the American people.

ALL THE MEDIA has supported our bigotry in the ME and Israeli propaganda was all Americans got.. until recently.. and much of the change in coverage and opinion comes from the internet, where unbiased thoughts can be expessed.

Your side is losing the "propaganda war" because, free of Israeli propaganda, it fails on it's merits. Not a single person here who defends Israel can answer how this is in America's best interest. Not one of you, including Jillian and David S have even attempted. That's not propaganda, that's a truth.

Be that as it may, how would supporting the Palestinians, which is what you and others are doing, help our national interest?
 
 
 
Be that as it may, how would supporting the Palestinians, which is what you and others are doing, help our national interest?

 

Good question.

First, we don't have to support the Palestinains as much as we have to be seen as supporting real efforts at peace.

1. It would demonstrate that America is an honest broker. With our current position in the ME, nobody believes that.. AND, Obama is going to be exposed on the world stage if he just parrots the same bullshit about Israel first on this issue.. which is why he's hiding from it now. America is dependent on the rest of the world and unless we strike a new course and remake our face globally, we will continue to pay the price in antiamericanism and all its forms.

2. It would put the onus on the Palestinians and the arab world to work more effectively in coming to terms with Israel. It removes the justified rational that peace can never be achieved as long as America has a hand in the ME.

3. It would force Israel to take a hard look at their actions. Without unbridled US support, Israel cannot survive giving the finger to the rest of the world and the UN. It would force Israel to think a lot smarter and to seek the value of soft power and true accomodation with their arab neighbors.

4. It would be the biggest blow to the justification for terrorism that we could possibly deliever. Bombs only make more terrorists and supports the justification for it. We cannot honestly claim to be fighting "terrorism" while we support Israel's terrorist activities.. particularly when much of what is happening today in the ME is because elections are forthcoming. If that what "democracy" looks like it's no mystery of why many reject it.
 
 
BAC, I do see your rationale, but seems to be underlaid with the assumption that first Israel loses its one ally and then tries to find 'an honest broker.' What you fail to acknowledge there is a clear absence of such, yeah I'll throw the US into that category too.

You give Palestinians the right for 'an honest' broker, but fail to see it would be the reverse to throw Israel to a body such as the UN, which has time and again allowed anti-semitism to stink up the place.
 
 
 
Perhaps our different views on this come from my being I'm older then you good brother. I've lived the civil rights era and if you think the differences are wide on Israel imagine what they were on race in this country.

 

Perhaps, but I too lived through the civil right movement and was ducking when the race riots were happening in the late 60s and early 70s, too.

 
Although the internet wasn't yet alive, there were plenty of mediums and opportunities for people to express their views. Ultimately, through all the hundreds of years of a racist culture, intelligence began to break through the noise. America was forced to take a hard look at itself because the conversations would not stop, would not just go away.

 

Of course. But the oppression of the Palestinians is far worse than what was happening to the Blacks of the 1950s.

 
We should never allow the percieved extremes to dictate society of what should or should not be discussed. I say "percieved" extremes because what one sees as extreme another sees as a critical element of the discussion. Again, race is a prime example.

 

I'm all over discussions, BAC, it's when these discussion are infected by the racists and ethnocentrists such that I am on hand viewed as JEW hater, and on the other as a JEW lover that I think the venue is too toxic to be doing any good.

 
Additionally, why run from the extremes? If a position is indeed extreme, shouldn't a more proper position be able to demonstrate its logical soundness, particularly when compared to the extreme?

 

Am I running to extremes?

 
In my opinion, what is demonstrated about this issue even here on this board.. even through the noise.. is those who profess this undying love of Israel before the best interests of their own country cannot intelligently support their position, cannot answer the critical question of how this benefits America, and hide behind the mask of "anti-semitism."

 

No argument from me on that point. I was called an antisemite for merely pointing out the history that disaster came out of about two days after I got here.

 
I've posted the thoughts of JEWISH thinkers who support the same position of Israel that the vast majority of the world support. They're only answer is to call other Jews "self-loathing" and to claim the entire planet is "anti-semitic."

 

Yeah, understood. Now do you understand how terrified these American Jews are that there will be another holocaust if they don't take a hard line?

I sure as fuck do.

 
I'm obviously getting more from these discussions than you are, but I'm sure there are other people who come away with the same. There is a reason why this discussion has been censored in America.. and that reason is because there is no logic that supports our position in the ME.

 

The reason American policy supports Isreal has NOTHING to do with American not bewing able to have discussion about it, BAC.

I've been having this discussion with rational Zionists for decades.
 
 
 
ALL THE MEDIA has supported our bigotry in the ME and Israeli propaganda was all Americans got.. until recently.. and much of the change in coverage and opinion comes from the internet, where unbiased thoughts can be expessed.

 

The discussion really started back in the mid 1960s.

Until that time the vast majority of Americans didn't give a moments thought to the Palestinians. They all saw EXODUS and that was the end of their thinking.

It really wasn't until the PLO started killing people that anyone started asking themselves what the hell was going on.

I hate to say it, but it took Palestinian terrorism to make people even LOOK at what was happening.

 
Your side is losing the "propaganda war" because, free of Israeli propaganda, it fails on it's merits. Not a single person here who defends Israel can answer how this is in America's best interest. Not one of you, including Jillian and David S have even attempted. That's not propaganda, that's a truth.

 

BAC I think they think they're losing the propaganda war because of the inherent anti-Semitism that they assume every non-Jew has.

Given the history of the Jews, and the treatment they got from the White non-Jewish races, one really cannot blame them for being paranoid.

The lesson of the Germany Haolcaust is not one that any Jew is EVER going to forget.

The fact that this lesson is to some extent making them untractably pqaranoid of anyone who doesn't completely agree with their jaded view of what's happening in the MidEast is completely understandable to me.

It doesn't excuse it, but at least I understand where it's coming from.

The Jews know perfectly well (as you must) that there is a small but dangerous group of Jew haters who would, if they could, kill every Jew in the world.

What I think many of them doubt is the fact that many people who do not support Israel as it functions today, would come to the aid of the Jews if those NAZI motherfuckers ever tried that crap here.

American NATIONALISTS have very little reason to support Isreali policies that we see about how the Palestinians are being treated.

But we have every reason to defend Jews from these nitwits who hate Jews.

And so the NAZIs on this board play this game of making every damned thread an indictment of Zionism.

I grow weary of thier games...just as I grow weary of people talking about the Palestinians as "animals"

Such thoughtless hatred offends me no matter who it is aimed at or who is saying it.
 
 
Bac the chief problem I have with your view is that it is so damn short sighted from a historical perspective. Islamic terrorism isn't new. In fact it predated the colonization of the Western hemisphere by at least 300 years. You ever hear of the hashishin from which the English word assassin ultimately derives? Mohhamed was a warrior every bit as much as a prophet, 5 of the first six Caliphs were mudered by other followers of Islam, and all of them were generals as much as religious leaders except possibly Mohhamed's immediate succesor who died too soon after taking the office for any one to be sure.

And lets not forget the doctrine of abnegation as seen in the Hadiths, which are at least as important to one's understanding of Islam as the Koran itself, and in which most of the worst doctrine's appear to be at least reinforced when not created out of whole cloth, pretty much means you can ignore whatever verses within the Koran you wish and take which ever one's you wish. Hence Osama doctrine of ever lasting war with the infidels is as justified as the view of those claiming that Followers should live in peace as the situation permits.

I do not hate all followers of Islam or for that matter any follower of Islam but I'd sure as hell like to know which version of Islam he follows before he moves in next door!
 
 
 
Bac the chief problem I have with your view is that it is so damn short sighted from a historical perspective. Islamic terrorism isn't new.

 

Indded, terrorism is a tried and true method of fighting. There's certainly nothing Islamic about it. Americans fought a war of terror against the Loyalists starting BEFORE 1776 and right through to the end of that war.

 
In fact it predated the colonization of the Western hemisphere by at least 300 years. You ever hear of the hashishin from which the English word assassin ultimately derives?

 

He was, if anything the Murder Incorporated of the Islamic world, you know. His assassin were FOR HIRE.

Yes, Mohammed was no pacifist and the mercuricuric rise of Islam from the backwater musing of desert tribes to a world wide religion was largely driven in that first century or so by the sword.

 
And lets not forget the doctrine of abnegation as seen in the Hadiths, which are at least as important to one's understanding of Islam as the Koran itself, and in which most of the worst doctrine's appear to be at least reinforced when not created out of whole cloth, pretty much means you can ignore whatever verses within the Koran you wish and take which ever one's you wish.

 

Much like I do when I discount the vast majority of what I read in the Christian Bible.

 
Hence Osama doctrine of ever lasting war with the infidels is as justified as the view of those claiming that Followers should live in peace as the situation permits.

 

An asute observation, my friend. The Islamic world is no less a house divided thatn Christendom's is, I gather.

 
I do not hate all followers of Islam or for that matter any follower of Islam but I'd sure as hell like to know which version of Islam he follows before he moves in next door!

 

What a sensible fellow you are, gary.
 
 
 
No no no no! They didn't have to get out of the way. They had to live side by side. The Arabs steadfastly refused to do that.

Go look up the nazi Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.

 

Sounds like peace to me.  
 
 
 
Spoils of war.

 

And which war was this? Last I checked, the Jews didn't fight WWII by themselves. No, I do believe it was America who won the war for the allies, without us they would of lost.

So technically, that land is ours.

But do humor me, which war was this that Israel won that automatically grants them to do whatever they want with the land and the people in it.
 
 
 
Imagine for a minute native Americans deciding to retake the USA using terror tactics...they'd all be vaporized in a heartbeat.

 

  Great example

The Native Americans would of been RIGHT to retake their land. We stole it, tricked them, and killed them for it.

What the fuck is with certain topics of the forum?

Does everybody decide to leave facts, common sense, and logic at the door?

The Allies won the war and as such earned the right to do as they pleased. If it was the right choice or not hardly matters.
 
 
WE didn't do anything. None of us were Alive! I refuse to take the blame for something that happened before I was even born.

I don't disagree with you but it isn't going to happen. And terrorist tactics are frowned upon these days...maybe if all the old tribes banded together and declared war they'd have a case.

Never said whether it was the right choice.

So since the Allies won the war (U.S, U.K, Russia) being the main three.

France was merely us supplying them at that point.

So Russia and U.S decide to split up the land of Israel; they would be justified under your logic since it's a spoil of war.

Or, as an American I can go to Israel tomorrow and not pay anything since I have the right to do as I please.

I fixed what I bolded for you.

When America considers it terrorist tactics is when America considers it terrorism.

We had no problem in the 80's with giving Saddam weapons to go and kill Iran. (The same weapons he used to invade Kuwait with in the early 90's).

Nor did we have a problem with giving Iran weapons secretly to go and kill Iraq.

Oh, and of course nor did we have a problem with giving Afghanistan "Freedom Fighters" in the 80's who were fighting the Soviets. Who out of that group did we give CIA training and billions to? Osama Bin Laden and indirectly helped put the Taliban in power.

I'd appreciate it if you didn't twist my posts. It isn't only America that judges what is a terrorist tactic, it is America and its allies. I'm not saying we aren't guilty of doing things wrong, just trying to be realistic. Terrorism is a non-state sponsored attack for the most part.

If I can add to that, terrorism is an act of violence against an INTENDED CIVILIAN TARGET for the purpose of affecting political conditions.

Except that Hamas and Hizbollah are funded in large measure by Iran.

And did America really think Saddam was going to stop at using the weapons on the military? Same thing for Iran and Osama.

Don't be naive, we gave them all weapons because we wanted them all to kill one another.

As far as I know, Saddam didn't even hate us until he realized we doublecrossed him by giving the Iranians weapons to go and kill him.

MAYBE. Regardless, Iran isn't attacking Israel and has not declared war on Israel so any and all attacks are terrorist attacks IMO.

No maybe, it's fact. Just like how so many of the weapons we've been finding on the dead terrorists in Iraq are made in Iran. Along with the roadside bombs.

Just like how the U.S gave weapons to Osama Bin Laden and crew to go and kill the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 80's.

Just like how the Soviets gave the NVA and VC weapons to kill the U.S. in Vietnam.

Just like how the Soviets gave North Korea weapons to kill the U.S. in North Korea.

Just like how the U.S. gave weapons to France to go and continue the fight during WWII.

I could go on, other countries have been funding groups or other countries in wars and fights for centuries now.

It's called indirect warfare.

I seem to recall reading that even the CIA was uncertain about Iran funding terrorists. And that the weapons may have been made in Iran but could have easily come from Russia. We don't know the facts, Robert, so don't pretend we do.

Really? The same CIA that proclaimed over and over that Saddam had WMDs? Their word today isn't worth that much to me.

We do know the facts. For the weapons to come from Russia they would of had to been built in Iran, sold to Russia, and then Russia would of had to have them sent to the terrorists in the Middle East.

That make much sense to you?

Yes it makes sense to me. But that doesn't mean Iran is supplying terrorists with weapons...it would mean Russia is doing it.

That's your screwed up logic.

Iran is supplying terrorists in Iraq and I believe even Afghanistan with weapons.

Russia has more nukes then even the U.S. now by the way.

A slightly over simplistic definition really, but only because many other tactics can fit in as well.

Of course it matters. It matters because of the terrible situation it created in the Middle East.

If we win in Iraq, (whatever winning in Iraq means) will you say it doesn't matter why Bush got us involved in that war?

Exactly.

David Petraeus already said there is no "victory" in Iraq. It's not a war that you can plant a flag somewhere and say you won.

It's a victory when a democratic government exists that can protect it's own nation and people and keep civil order. They are pretty much getting there, finally. Focus is shifting now to Afghanistan, and more specifically, Northwest Pakistan.

We all know that won't happen in Iraq though.

The second we leave, the Civil War that has been waiting to be fully unleashed will begin.

I always said the focus should of been on Afghanistan.
 
 
 
I haven't noticed how 'nice' she is. I'll have to take your word for it. She hasn't taken my olive branch.

No, we don't all know that, at all. We will be there, in force through 2012, at least, that's three more years. Iraqis have made great strides in the past year as a result of the Surge to finally get their house in order. In three more years they should be in passable shape.

And we will remain indefinitely, in some level in Iraq, mostly and Striker Airbase in the Kurdish region as that gives us a massive Airbase in fighter escort range of every valuable target in South Central Asia, including targets like Georgia and Tehran.

We will not be there for more then three years.

Here's why:

Why do you think it has to be a democratic govt.? Given the situation, a Saddam style dictatorship would probably be better for all involved.

No, part of the agreement is a PERMANENT US Airbase Base in Iraq and Camp Striker up near Mosul. I know, I get the unclassified versions of the Defense Intelligence Briefs every day, and that is a very definite part of the agreement.

We will be in Iraq as long or longer than we have been in Korea. The primary reason we invaded in the first place was for a permanent strategic airbase in the heart of South Central Asia.... Now we have it, for as long as we need to be there.
 
 
I believe the US military will be in Iraq in some capacity or another until the oil there runs out.

The withdrawl is for GROUND COMBAT Units, only. It does not apply to the Air Forces at all. We will have upwards 10,000 Air Combat forces in Iraq in perpetuity.

Do you mean to say that you think the situation in the Middle East wasn't terrible before?

There were wars in the Middle East before there was Muslims and they managed to up the ante on what has always been one of the most violence prone areas of the world since God said "Let there Be light" The war in both Iran and Iraq remains in many ways a war to see if Democracy can tame the Baser instincts of Islam as it once tamed the baser instincts of Roman Catholicism.
 
 
 
The reason American policy supports Isreal has NOTHING to do with American not bewing able to have discussion about it, BAC.

I've been having this discussion with rational Zionists for decades.

 

Again, I do not agree. Censorship surrounds everything Israel in this country.

Any guess why this thread which supports zionism isn't in the basement?

Rational conversation on Israel would force the recognition that our policy in the ME is mindless.. and the crap about jewish victimhood is bullshit.

America deserves every drop of anti-americanism that is growing around the world.. and Americans will justly deserve the blowback.

Thanks for the laugh first thing in the morning. Unfortunately a stable Iraq is a pipe dream. The current regional and civil war has been brewing for years, Saddam was the wedge and force that kept a lid on the Sunnis and Shia.

When I was in Iraq, the number of Iraqi National Guard members who played for both sides was the biggest problem. We had guys who would receive money and training from our forces in the day, only to join the insurgency and attack our gates with mortars at night. This is why our military leaders our very humble about the situation, being there is sobering, and like Sec.Gates already stated, any gains in stability and security can be rolled back rather quickly.

Even the most optimistic person, can see the situation for what it is, and realize stability without major US involvement is laughable.
 
 
If the Palestinians took all their weapons and dumped them into the sea, what would happen?

If Israel took all of their weapons and dumped them into the sea, what would happen?

It really is a case of 'being on the other side...'
 
 
 
If I can add to that, terrorism is an act of violence against an INTENDED CIVILIAN TARGET for the purpose of affecting political conditions.

 

Absolutely right.

Terrorism is a tried and true method of effecting political conditions and it is nothing new.

Is is as old as war itself. Using terror tactics as a means of war is far older than the existence of nations or of national armies.

Terrorism WAS the first conventional system of war.
