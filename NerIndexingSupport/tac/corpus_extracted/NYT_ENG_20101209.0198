Nationwide Title Clearing, a Palm Harbor company at the center
of the nation's robo-signing controversy, is going on the offensive
against its critics.

On Wednesday, the company sued a St. Petersburg foreclosure
defense lawyer, Matthew Weidner, for alleged libel and slander.

And it recently obtained an injunction, ordering Sarasota lawyer
Christopher Forrest to remove videotaped depositions he had posted
of three Nationwide Title employees describing an assembly-line
process of signing mortgage-related documents.

The ACLU of Florida said Thursday that it has filed an emergency
appeal of the injunction, which it called a "gag order" and a
restraint of free speech.

The legal action marks another chapter in a storm over the
validity of documents used to foreclose on millions of American
homes. Earlier this fall, Bank of America and other lenders
temporarily halted foreclosure proceedings because of evidence that
many documents contained errors and fraudulent statements.

One of the most outspoken critics of the foreclosure process is
Weidner, who writes a widely read blog in which he has criticized
not only banks, but judges, lawyers and companies like Nationwide
Title that process mortgage-related documents.

Nationwide Title does not prepare foreclosure papers. However,
lenders have authorized several of its employees to sign for them
on assignments of mortgage, which transfer ownership of a loan from
one party to another and are key in determining who has the legal
right to foreclose.

In a suit filed in Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court, the company
says Weidner has "deliberately and maliciously" used the term
robo-signers "to vilify NTC for signing documents  when (Weidner)
knew that it is entirely legally and appropriate to do so."

The "gist" of statements on Weidner's blog, the suit says, is
that Nationwide Title is an "unethical company" that manufactures
false evidence used to foreclose. The statements have permanently
damaged the company's reputation and subjected it to "public
hatred, scorn and ridicule," according to the suit, which seeks
damages in excess of $15,000.

Weidner declined to comment.

Barbara Petersen, president of Florida's First Amendment
Foundation, praised him for bringing to light serious problems,
including court hearings from which the public was barred.

"I've been working with Matt on trying to open the foreclosure
process and we've made great strides that have a lot to do with his
activism," Petersen said. "He's bringing a great deal of national
attention to what's going on in Florida."

In the Sarasota case, Nationwide Title obtained an injunction
Nov. 19, ordering Forrest to remove the depositions he posted on
YouTube of employees Bryan Bly, Crystal Moore and Dhurata Doko. All
three said they signed hundreds of documents at a time and Moore
acknowledged she never read any of them.

Because of the postings, Nationwide Title said, the three had to
endure veiled death threats and "highly offensive" comments about
their appearance.

"The defendants are not public figures but rather enjoyed quiet
private lives until the abrupt disruption caused by Mr. Forrest and
his firm," Nationwide Title said.

As of Thursday, the depositions were still on YouTube. Forrest
said he took down the ones he posted but "what appears to have
happened is that a whole bunch of people re-posted them."

Forrest represents a Sarasota couple challenging their
foreclosure, partly on the grounds that Nationwide Title improperly
prepared certain documents related to their mortgage. However, the
company is not a party to the foreclosure suit.

In appealing the injunction to Florida's Second District Court
of Appeal, the ACLU said that putting the videotaped depositions on
YouTube "gives the world an opportunity to see how the practices
of banks and title companies are affecting homeowners having
serious financial problems."
