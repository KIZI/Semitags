At 10:39 a.m. Tuesday, a small Beacon Hill wire service posted a
one-paragraph item on its website reporting that foreclosures in
Massachusetts had jumped almost 80 percent in July from a year
prior.

Less than a half-hour later, ever-vigilant aides to Republican
gubernatorial candidate Charles D. Baker began Tweeting and
re-Tweeting the
news to try to undercut Governor Deval Patrick's argument that the
state
economy is heading in the right direction.

"Foreclosures up 80% in MA during the past year," Amy
Goodrich, Baker's
communications director, wrote on Twitter. "Def not 'on the mend,'
but if
that's 'on the move' it's in the wrong direction."

Such is the state of the Massachusetts governor's race these
days, where no
shred of economic news goes un-Tweeted, un-blasted in press
releases, or
un-mentioned on the campaign trail. It's a never-ending effort to
spin
economic news to bolster the candidates' fundamental political
narratives.

In Patrick's world, the state is experiencing six straight
months of job
gains, with 60,000 new jobs, and ranks third in the nation in job
creation
this year. "The economy is responding to our strategy, which is
education,
innovation, and infrastructure," Patrick said after the most
recent job
numbers came out. His campaign produced web ads emphasizing the
same point.

In Baker's world, 150,000 fewer residents are working than four
years ago,
the unemployment rate has nearly doubled since Patrick took office,
and a
recent drop in the state's consumer confidence level is "news of a
failed
recovery." Four New England states having lower jobless rates, his
campaign asserted on Monday, rendering Patrick's optimistic
economic
assessments "ridiculous."

At this point, the campaigns are trying less to influence
voters, who are
paying scant attention to the constant stream of Tweets and
e-mails, than
to influence opinion-makers, insiders, and the press.

Economists, however, dismiss the endless skirmishes, arguing
that the
state's economy is influenced by large forces outside the
governor's
control, and that using one index to either hail or disparage his
leadership is misleading.

"We're not looking at one data point in isolation," said Gus
Faucher, an
economist who studies the state's economy at Moody's Analytics.
"We're
looking at trends and all the data together ... to give a broader
picture
of where the Massachusetts economy is going."

The candidates' aides, however, carry out their arguments minute
by minute
and day by day, underscoring the extent to which they believe that
the
race, will be won or lost on economic turf, even more so than in a
typical
political contest.

Despite the rhetoric from both camps, economists say the overall
economic
picture is mixed: Massachusetts enjoys a high bond rating and is
recovering
faster than other states, but still faces a long and uncertain path
to cut
its unemployment rate to prerecession levels.

"Massachusetts' economy, as bad as it is, is better than most
other
states, and that continues to be true," said David G. Tuerck, an
economist
who heads the conservative Beacon Hill Institute.

"But the local, state, and regional economy is pretty much a
captive of
the national economy, so there's not much to be said there. No
uptick or
downturn of the jobs number is very consequential as far as the
qualifications of these candidates are concerned," he said.

Tuerck said he agrees with state Treasurer Timothy P. Cahill, an
independent candidate, and with Baker that Patrick's tax and
regulatory
policies, as well as his support of the Cape Wind project, could
hurt the
state's ability to attract businesses.

But "it's not plausible to say that Deval Patrick can do much
harm or much
good in terms of rescuing the state from the overall picture
nationally,"
Tuerck said.

Although all the candidates want to reduce the state's 9 percent
unemployment rate by five or six points, "that's something you
can't fix
outside of Washington," he said.

Michael D. Goodman - an associate professor of public policy at
the
University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who edits MassBenchmarks, an
economic
journal - reflected a similar viewpoint.

"The future economic trajectory of the state is going to be a
function of
international economic and national economic developments and
federal
decisions, and a lot of these day-to-day economic conditions in the
state
are driven by forces outside of the control of state officials,"
he said.

"There are certainly policies that can make a valuable
difference, but
these large economic challenges are being played out at a much
larger
scale,' Goodman said.

That has not stopped the candidates and their aides from waging
battles on
anything that seems to fit their platforms, including Tuesday's jab
on
foreclosures, based on an item in State House News Service.

Faucher said that even though candidates try to frame economic
indicators
for their own ends, voters' perceptions will ultimately be shaped
by their
personal experiences.

"You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear," Faucher
said. "They
know if they've lost a job or if their neighbors have lost a job or
can't
find one."
