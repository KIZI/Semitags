In a press conference Friday on the street
where Andrew Joseph Stack III is suspected of burning down his own
house before flying a small plane into a North Austin office
building, his wife issued a statement through a spokesperson
expressing her sympathy for those affected and declining to speak
further on the matter.

"Words cannot adequately express my sorrow or the sympathy I
feel for everyone affected by this unimaginable tragedy," Stack's
wife, Sheryl, said in a statement read by family spokesman Rayford
Walker. He was standing near the family's North Austin house, which
was gutted by fire a short time before Stack's plane took off
Thursday morning.

"Due to the ongoing investigation related to this tragedy, I
feel it best to make no comment beyond this statement, and to not
repond to questions of any nature," the statement said.
