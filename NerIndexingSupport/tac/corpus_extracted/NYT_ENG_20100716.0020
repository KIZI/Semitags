A conference of border governors from the United
States and Mexico that Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona had canceled
after the Mexicans refused to come here because of the state's
immigration enforcement law is being salvaged by Gov. Bill
Richardson of New Mexico.

Aides to Richardson, a Democrat, said that the conference would
be in Santa Fe, N.M., in late September instead of Phoenix and that
all six Mexican governors planned to attend, along with Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican.

Brewer, a Republican, said she would not attend. Gov. Rick Perry
of Texas, also a Republican, has said he doubts he will attend.

The conference has been held for nearly 30 years. Brewer, who is
this year's chairwoman, canceled the meeting after receiving a
letter from the Mexican governors condemning the Arizona law as
discriminatory.
