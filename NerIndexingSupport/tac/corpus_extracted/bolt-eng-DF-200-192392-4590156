I found this article in the daily mail:

 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz...tery-girl.html 

I'm a bit jealous, frankly. I have a huge crush on Dan -if you can call it that, I think my feelings might even go a bit deeper. He seems just perfect for me although I barely know him. I keep hoping and dreaming that one day I'll be able to meet him. My father has contacts, you see, (long story) so I just hope and pray that I'd meet him on whatever project he has next (e.g. a film premiere). I missed my opportunity to meet him during work experience at Leavesden Studios, which was really frustrating.

Seems unusual for a person my age to have a celebrity crush, but there you are.

Are there any others that have a crush on daniel radcliffe?
 
 
This guys represents everything that's wrong with middle-class teenagers.
 
 
He looks like a creepy middle aged man..

why, what's wrong with him?  

he's pretty much perfect in my opinion. Compared to most middle class guys, especially the ones on tsr, he's an absolute angel.
 
 
she's massive, they don't look right together
 
 
lmao what the **** is he wearing
 
 
I know he's a bit of a twunt, but he's loaded and famous, so I can't see him going out with that girl. She's a bit of a beast. Look at those thighs!
 
 
Dan Radcliffe is hot, but those photos are truly terrible. He looks like an aging woman.

Regarding your 'crush': thinking you have a connection with someone you've never met is not a useful thing to do.

The woman in your sig... *drools*. I love her in True Blood. I'd give all my money to them if they made a sex scene with her and Jessica.

Moving on...

OP, don't be a loser, Daniel Radcliffe is a horrible actor ;p. I truly hope you're trolling...

this is exactly what i thought.

I, on the other hand, am shorter than him, we'd look perfect together...

lol. it's not his acting i find attractive, it's his personality in general.
 
 
Talk about undershooting - she's a beast of a bird and he's a rich, famous actor.....

You don't really know his personality though, even if you think you do. He has to convey a certain image to the public.

Anyways, if you're really that upset... I will try to be serious... ahem *holds back laughter*. They don't look like they're together, they're not even holding hands or anything! I bet she's just one of his friends, and it is the daily mail reporting it. Probably nothing. I'm sure he's still a free man.

they call her "striking" in the daily mail...

lol that's reassuring. although i'm not that upset to the point of crying, if that's what you mean...It's just that I die a bit inside everytime I hear another rumour about him dating some girl...oh well, I'll have to live with it I suppose.
 
 
He needs lifts.
 
 
"He charmed millions with his bewitching performances in the Harry Potter films."

Biggest lie ever told.

This. They look like a weird couple as well, they look like a mother and a 10 year old son with an aged alcoholic's face.

Please tell me the brunette is a man in disguise.. WTF...

I don't think so.

Aren't there millions of Harry Potter fans out there?  

just because you don't like the series...

Well at least he decided to wear some clothes for a change! lol  
Oh and OP, isn't HARRY POTTER much more charming <3

"for a change"-what does that mean?   it's not like he goes bare naked everywhere he goes, for chrissake. that was only on a Broadway show.  

funny how no-one seems to have a crush on dan radcliffe, yet everyone seems to love robbert pattison  

oh well, at least that means there'll be less competition!  
 
 
she's fat! you still have a chance

That would be insanely hot!  

But them saying he wowed millions in Harry Potter, or whatever they said,   out of the three of the main actors in it, he was the worst!

Yup, for a change! He is a stripper, google it  
  Pattinson is even worse, it's a HUGE mistake he played Edward.
I'm still saying, if Dan can be more like Harry...........   <3

Or Jessica and Pam ;p.

Yeah he didn't wow many people, he's a crap actor that bought nothing to the role. Harry Potter was suppose to be this common, underprivelaged/ deprived kid who was never encouraged in school etc. Daniel Radcliffe walks on with this private school accent and **** eating grin.

Another thing that pissed me off with him (sorry, getting into a rant now ;p) is that in the books you felt sorry for Harry Potter, in the films he seems like he comes from a wealthy/ caring family with a good education and he just looks down on him. Wanted to kill him every time he spoke in the films, he's so rigid <.<

being a fan of his, i have googled his name several times, and i can assure you that he is not a stripper.  

i dunno, i kind of like dan for who he is.
 
 
She looks like she's about to eat him nomnomnomnom

  Couldn't be said better!!
 
 
Oh my days she massive, compared to him. And Harry got **** fashion sense.....skinny jeans...really?

Heeeey, that's DANIEL NOT Harry! :s
 
 
my favourite bit is when hermione says "i'm sure harry's kissing was more than satisfactory" and harry's face is like "see?". lol.
 
 
She is like a giant next to him!

not exactly contradiction, is it?

 

What about you saying all men are sexist slobs and that attractive men are also egosticial dicks? It's not even like you know Radcliffe  
 
 
I just do not understand the attraction

BAHAHAHAHAHHAHA either you are blind or foolish?
you might aswell have a crush on a tramp on the streets cost D.R looks like a bum.
A guy with his sort of money should have rough/rugged good looks not look plain rough.

This has to be a troll.

well, emma watson does have that horrible eyebrow reflex...but then again i still like her  

rupert grint is definitely the best actor, i love his expressions. have you seen his face when he pulls out the mandrake in Herbology in the second film? bahahahaha.

For the record, I loved the books and on the whole found the films pretty entertaining, but there is no question Daniel Radcliffe is the worst thing about them. I doubt anyone genuinely believes he can act.
 
 
His 'gf' seems to tower over him, epic lulz.

jesus christ i met this kid in camden once in a record store. he actually has a decent taste in tunes, but bar this hes a ****.
 
 
now they're claiming she's his girlfriend lol.

I am soo jealous!  
 
 
Look like an odd couple. She's bigger than him and what's with Dan's blazer?
 
 
Daniel has a thing for tall girls, I remember Laura O'Stoole was also taller than him.
They don't look right together, and this is a non-fan saying this.
 
 
Bloody hell, he looks like John Lennon!

now that you mention it...  
 
 
**** is he small.
 
 
Her face is weirdly shaped and she looks kind of....manly  .

No OP, I think it's creepy and stalkerish that you do and that you want to use connections to meet him.

lol i'm not exactly stalking him am I?   no big fan of his would turn down the opportunity to meet him if they could.

im probably never gonna meet him anyway. i passed him once at leavesden studios, that's about it. i can't even begin to imagine the expression on my face. and rupert grint almost run me over with his golf cart.
 
 
It looks a bit weird because she's noticeably taller than him, I knew he was short but she makes him look really short  

Also, WTF is he wearing?

I bet it'll catch on & become the new trend hahaha
 
 
Words cannot quite sum up how weird he looks in that photo.
 
 
Why does she look like a giant in comparison?
 
 
im pretty sure he's mentally unstable
 
 
Omg she's actually so fugly. Ewww what a munter.

And Radcliffe looks.. well words can't describe, but my eyes burned out in horror.
 
 
I always thought Daniel Radcliffe looked a bit peculiar...
 
 
Isn't he gay?! I swear he came out a year or so ago to attitude magazine
 
 
The brunette is quite on the large side to be honest, especially in comparison to Mr Radcliffe who looks miniscule in comparison.

But its refreshing to see a celebrity dating someone who is not famous. Nor fits the cliche of skinny starvation size -10. I am not a fan of him but its nice to see Daniel Radcliffe may be open-minded.
 
 
He has the constant look of someone spaced out on caffeine.
 
 
He looks like a coke whore version of where's wally. Or someone who is trying to pull the 'i'm bohemian/just fallen out of a topshop festival window' look.
 
 
That's a woman next to him?! :s
 
 
I think she looks worse 'cause he is so ******* tiny.

No, he just gave an interview for them, talking about gay rights and acceptance and stuff.
 
 
He looks quite disproportionate in that first photo.
 
 
someone actually gave me neg rep. wonder who it may be

soo sad right now, it's like someone has run a knife through my heart.
 
 
bump.
 
 
she's very rich, works at leavesden as a PA and enjoys hedonistic nights out drinking lots of alcohol.   big surprise.

oh well, at least i look like a woman, which is more than one can say about her.

wow, i sound like a total bitch  
 
 
i guess nobody cares then.
 
 
i laughed so hard at that first picture. lmao.
 
 
all I can see is thighs
