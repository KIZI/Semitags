Australia on Thursday formally lodged its bid to host the Asian Cup 2015 finals,
the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) announced.

AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam received the bid book for the confederation's
flagship tournament from Football Federation of Australia (FFA) chairman Frank
Lowy at a ceremony at AFC House in Kuala Lumpur.

"It has been a win-win situation for the AFC and FFA since Australia joined the
AFC in 2006. Now we are all reaping the benefits of this association," bin
Hammam said.

"I assure them that their bid will have my recommendation when it goes before
the AFC Executive Committee," he added.

Australia is the only candidate to bid for the 16th edition of the AFCâ€™s top
tournament for national teams.

The AFC Executive Committee is expected to make a decision on the hosting rights
at its meeting next January on the sidelines of the AFC's Asian Cup Qatar 2011.

Finals will take place in Doha, Qatar from January 7-29. Australia are grouped
with the Korea Republic, India and Bahrain.
