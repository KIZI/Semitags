An Austrian man accused of attempting to kidnap the ex-head of the Kazakh secret
service has walked free from court after judges in Vienna on Friday ruled there
was insufficient evidence in the case.

The accused, known only as Ildar A., had been on trial for the attempted
abduction of exiled Kazakh spy boss Alnur Musayev in the Austrian capital in
2008.

Prosecutors claimed 61-year-old Ildar A. attempted to abduct Musayev on behalf
of a foreign power but judges freed him for lack of evidence.

Ildar A. must, however, hand over his passport to Austrian authorities and
inform them immediately if he changes his address.

He still faces charges of bribing police officers to illegally obtain the
whereabouts of Rakhat Aliyev, the former son-in-law of Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev.

Like Musayev, Aliyev took refuge in Austria and the two men were close friends.

Musayev had been head of the Kazakh secret service (KNB) from 1997 to 2001,
while Aliyev, who had extensive dealings in the world of politics and business,
had been deputy foreign minister and then ambassador to Austria.

In March 2008, a Kazakh military tribunal sentenced both men in absentia for an
attempted coup.

But the 46-year-old former deputy foreign minister always maintained his
innocence and claimed he was the victim of a political witch-hunt designed to
crush his chances of running in the 2012 presidential elections.
