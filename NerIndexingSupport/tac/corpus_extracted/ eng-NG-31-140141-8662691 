Dont put your short sleeve jerseys away just yet! Temps looks to be in
the mid 80s. Hot Hot Hot just like that calypso tune you hear around
Brooklyn. I also have special permission to tour Kingsborough
Community College, where we'll take in beautiful rare views of the
ocean front.

And it'll be nice and easy since we're all going to Sandy Hook on
Sunday, right?
