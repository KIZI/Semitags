I still don't understand why people complain about this.  Are they supposed
to just let 3 in?  They could let 2 wild cards like the NFL, or let 8 teams
in like the NBA.

Clearly they are the hottest team, but did they earn the right to be in the
playoffs? I say no. Over the course of the season, they weren't the best
team in their division, so why should they get a chance to play for the
championship?

If you go by "not being good enough" they should get rid of divisions and
just let the top 4 records in.  This year the Cubs were 85-77, last year the
Cards were 83-78, and in 2005 the Padres were just 82-80 (7th best record in
the NL!).  If you don't think the wild card (who records those years were
89-73 [+ the tiebreaker vs SD], 88-74, 89-73 respectively) then your crazy.
The Rockies had the 2nd best record in the NL, and that was with the
majority of there games vs. the best division in the NL.  I don't know if
you know this, but the only team in the NL East or Central with a winning
record vs the West is Atlanta, and ONLY Atlanta.  That's the definition of
division dominance if you ask me.  Even the big bad AL East had 4 teams with
a winning record vs them, and 2 right at .500.  How do they not deserve to
be where they are?  It's not the NBA where last year they had two 41-41 and
a 40-42 team in the playoffs.  How do you think people felt when the Cards
were just 5 games over .500, and had the 5th best record in the NL last
year, than went on to win the WS.  I'm not complaining, but I heard many
people saying they didn't even deserve to be in because the Phillies had a
better record but were left out of the playoffs.  Maybe they didn't deserve
to be there, but thats the way the rules go, and they stepped it up when it
counted to win the WS.  But hey, the Central was horrible last year, and it
was again this year.  This year the Cubs made it in with the 6th best record
in the NL.  But, they deserve to get in with there 85 wins because they won
there division, while a team with 89 (+ the tiebreaker) wins shouldn't be in
because they didn't win there division, right?

I tend to be a purist on most baseball issues like Lance is, but not the
WC.  I just don't mind it.  I do understand his reasoning though.

However, I'll bet he still will root for the Rockies, as everyone hates

And why aren't they playing the "Rocky" theme at Coors Field?  Seems
fitting enough in a couple of ways.

Here is why... baseball was set up on an 162 season.  You have to build
a team that can win enough games to qualify for the division
championship.  The wild card system allows a flawed team that "gets hot"
in the last 4 weeks to get a shot at the playoffs.  That is why WC teams
(IMHO) do well in the playoffs... they are hot at the end of the season.

At a minimum, there needs to be some penalty for being a team not good
enough to win their division.  Or create 4 divisions per league.  Or
something... because I don't like the WC either.

You can make the "gets hot" argument for anybody.  How about the Phillies?
They had an amazing comeback to with there division, not the WC.  The Yanks
won the WC by 6 games this year.  They only won 6 of there last 10, they
didn't need to get hot at the end of September.  The WC team isn't the only
one that gets hot.  Plus, if they're so "flawed", there are 3 "not flawed"
teams that get a shot to knock them out.  I hope the Cardinals win the WC
next year just to hear what you people say....

No more stupid to let teams in the playoffs which win less games than
the wild card team. The Phillies won less games than the Rockies while
the Cubs had the worst record in the NL and look what happened? Not even
good enough to win their division? Please...

Maybe MLB should combine all the teams in one league -- best record goes
to the World Series. Better yet, combine both leagues and crown the team
with the best overall record, eliminating the playoffs all together. ;)

First thing is that, if the Cards win the WC, I will watch them but I
will say the exact same thing about them.  The Phillies had to play well
enough, like the 1964 Cardinals, to be in a position to get hot and win
the division.

The bottom line is that the WC cheapens baseball's traditional system of
earning the post season by being the best in your division over a long
season.  The only reason it exists is to keep more teams in contention
at the end of the season.  If that is what you like, well, that is what
we have.

There are four things I hate the most in Baseball The Wild Card concept, the
five game playoff,  the DH,  naming teams after large geographical area
instead of cities.

The wild card issue can be easily addressed with having the winningest
division team earn a bye, while the other two division winners play to earn
the right to face the winningest team for the League championship. This also
solves the 5 game initial playoff series issue by eliminating it. This would
eliminate graveyard scheduled games and allow all games to be prime time.

The 5 game first round playoff is impure all playoffs should be 7 games! To
sweep 4 out of 7 games is a skill, but to sweep 3 out of 5 games means you
have 3 pitchers.

I hate the DH. The DH is not a baseball function. The pitcher should always
have to bat!! Either both leagues have it or neither. I prefer neither.

I hate the idiotic non-city named teams. Colorado, Texas, Arizona,
Minnesota, and Florida. How can a city establish a team identity with a
state name? It is stupid. I would never imagine the Minnesota Cardinals or
the Illinois White Sox,  or the Kansas-Missouri Royals.....

play the Nationals and the Pirates and the Giants ;)

In any event, there is tremendous uncertainty over who the best teams
are at the end of the season. That's why more need to be thrown into
the playoff mix.

It used to take 154 games of the exact same schedule to determine the
best in each league.

Now with the hodge-podge of scheduling...who can say who is best, or
even near-best?

LidsvilleNine asks...

 

Well, since you asked...

First of all, options with 2 divisions and one less rounds of playoffs are not
realistic.  Also, series byes in baseball are unnatural; teams don't take a week
or so off between games.  Three rounds mean more money, and 8/30 teams making
the playoffs in not unreasonable.

So the problem is, how to make 3 rounds of playoffs work with no wildcard, given
the teams currently in MLB.

First, the NL.  Create 4 divisions.  Simple.

NL East: PHI, PIT, NY, WAS
NL South: ATL, CIN, FLA, HOU
NL Central: CHI, COL, MIL, STL
NL West: AZ, LA, SD, SF

Four division winners meet in the NL playoffs.  First round East/South and
Central/West.  Or rotate each year.  Or use coin flips.  Who cares?  HFA could
be decided by regular season wins, coin flip, whatever.

AL a little trickier, but doable:

AL West: LA, OAK, SEA, TEX
AL Central: CHI, CLE, KC, MIN

Option 1:

AL Northeast: BOS, DET, TOR
AL Southeast: BAL, NY, TAM

The advantage of this option is that both the Yankees and the Red Sox make the
playoffs almost every year.

Option 2:

AL East: BAL, DET, TAM, TOR
AL Beast: BOS, NY

The advantage of this option is that either the Yankees or the Red Sox are
GUARANTEED to make the playoffs every year.  Also, with a heavily unbalanced
schedule(90/72), the Red Sox and Yankees will play against each other every
weekend, so Fox and ESPN will have an easy time choosing the game of the week.

Also, make all series 7 games, no off days during series.  Start the next round
soon after all current series have completed.

I think Lance is on record speaking for eight divisions of four teams
each with no wild card.  Even if you have a losing record, you've
definitively WON something, even if it's a weak division.

I look at the DH and the Wildcard about the way I look at Gay Marriage;

Alright, I have no question, and I would like a reasonable answer.  Some of
you are claiming that the WC team is worthless.  So the question is, why
can't the two best teams in a division be the two best teams in the league?
Some of you suggest 4 divisions.  If they go to 4 divisions, what if they
ended up like this (I'll use the NL as an example, because it could easily
be adjusted to 4 divisions.)

A:  D-Backs, Rockies, Phillies, Mets

B:  Padres, Braves, Cubs, Brewers

C:  Cards, Astros, Reds, Dodgers

D:  Pirates, Marlins, Nats, Giants

Obviously this wouldn't happens, but you can understand what I'm saying.
Division D is almost worthless.  The current system is the best there can
be.  If one team is just unbeatable (see the 116 win Mariners in 2001), it
gives the 2nd place team a chance.  And in that 2001 season, the Mariners
had the best record in the baseball (obviously), while the 2nd place A's had
the 2nd best record in baseball with 102 wins.  How can the team with the
2nd best record in ALL OF BASEBALL, not make the playoffs?  If they played
half there games vs each other, than OK.  But they only play each other
barely 10-11% of the games.

Brad Huekels asks...

 

The two best teams in the league *could* be in the same division.  But if this
is a justification for the wildcard (aka the second place team with the most
wins), that is not sufficient.

1) Presumption is the playoffs (albeit flawed due to short series and excessive
off days) are intended to find the best team in the league and in all of MLB.
The regular season has found the best team in each division.  Any team that is
not the best in its division *may* be the second best team in the league, but
clearly not the best in the league.

2) If you have playoffs, you run the risk that the second best team may be
excluded.  Don't you think in the seven decades the World Series was held
between the NL Pennant winner and AL Pennant winner that there were years where
the second best team in baseball was in the same league as the best team in
baseball?  For instance, in 1967, isn't it possible the SF Giants were the
second best team in baseball?

3) Which second place team do you choose?  The one with the most wins?  Using
that reasoning, the 1964 World Series should have been between the Yankees (99
wins) and White Sox (98 wins) and excluded the Cardinals (93 wins).  Since you
can't compare win totals between teams that play different schedules, you can't
use wins to accurately determine the best second place team.  Might as well use
a coin flip; any second place team is nearly as likely as the others to be the
second best team in the league.

 

A second chance.  Probably the worst thing about the wildcard is when a team
that finished 10 games behind another team and is clearly inferior to that team
gets a second chance to beat that team in a short series.  Looking at the 1997
standings, how can anyone conclude the Marlins were a better team than the
Braves that year?

In your scenario, Division D is weak this year, but that will change.   Leagues
have been weaker relative the other league and then flipped.  Same with
divisions.  And, if you play an unbalanced schedule, you won't really know which
division is weak.

 

Even under the current system, the team with the second best record could still
miss the playoffs as a relatively weaker team could amass more wins playing an
easier schedule.  Besides, if a team is clearly second best at best, why should
they be included in a tournament to determine the very best?

 

The 2001 Mariners and 2001 A's played common opponents and each other over 162
games.  At the end, the Mariners were clearly the better team, and the A's were
at best, the second best team in baseball, but maybe a lot worse.  While you are
concerned about a team that *might* be the second best team in baseball being
excluded, I'm concerned about a team that is clearly at best the second best
team in the league being given a chance to be named the best in the league.

In a five games series, the chance of a sweep is statistically around 25%.  Bad
teams win 3 games in a row many times in a season, often against good teams.
Take the best and worst team in the league and have them play a 5 game series,
and the worst team will sweep about 5% of the time.
