"BOO HOO- the godless ACLU is making me say 'happy holidays'...."

No wonder the world laughs at Americans. Â These right wing jackasses
in congress need to be slapped.

Meantime, if one of these fuckwads EVER got thrown in jail for no
reason, he would be BEGGING for the ACLU to save his ass...

... Rush Limbaugh knows that all too well... doesn't he?
