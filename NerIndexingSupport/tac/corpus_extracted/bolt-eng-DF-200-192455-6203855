Which country or continent will lead the way in terms of: highest atheist/agnostic population, atheism/agnosticism being the highest growing belief in that country, pure state secularism so no: faith schools, religious privilege, unequivocal separation from the church and state, etc.

I would have said Europe, but I am starting to doubt that now. Perhaps China, Japan, Canada or Australia?
 
 
I'd say Europe too.
 
 
Well France already has all the things you mentioned. They take secularism to the extreme to the point where religious symbols i.e crosses on necklaces aren't allowed in any school. That said, the French public aren't as secular in beliefs when compared to the populations of the Nordic countries, so it's depends what you mean really.

In terms of the way the state works, France is already there. In terms of population... probably Sweden, perhaps Australia.
 
 
North Korea?
 
 
Sweden is very atheist, I believe.

It's also a nirvana of happiness, quality of life and delicious socialism.

What a country.

Yeah, but we all know the Swedish aren't much fun. They have incredibly strict laws on everything, its nice, but certainly not a country I would ever want to live in...
 
 
The Middle East.
 
 
 
North Korea?

 

This.
 
 
europe, specifically places like sweden and denmark.

Probably agree with you there

Seems contradictory. If gov is supposed to stay completely separate from religion then that would mean they would make no laws interfering with religion or the practice thereof. Religious privilege would thrive under this system.

I think the communists were effective in oppressing all religion.
 
 
In the long term; China.
 
 
USA's an example of how having an officially secular state does not automatically lead to a weakening of religion... be careful what you wish for  
 
 
Scandinavian Countries
 
 
Czech republic
 
 
Europe in terms of %, Asia in terms of overall people.
 
 
How can it be Europe? are you completely stupid? ever thought where the centre of the world's largest religion is?
 
 
Actually, Sweden and Denmark are already up there,  according to a Gallop poll of 143 countries from 2009 . When asked "Is religion important in your daily life?", only 16.5% of Swedes and 18% of Danes said "yes". The only country with fewer people saying yes in the poll was Estonia. Ranked in terms of how irreligious they were on this marker, the UK came in 8th with 26.5%, the USA 46th with 65% (if I counted correctly). At the other end of the scale, Bangladesh and Niger came in at equal 142nd with 100%.

Overall, of the 10 least religious countries, 8 were in Europe and 2 in East Asia:

"Is religion important in your daily life?"
Country Yes No
Estonia 16% 78%
Sweden 16.5% 83%
Denmark 18% 80.5%
Czech Republic 20.5% 74.5%
Norway 20.5% 78%
Hong Kong 23% 75.5%
Japan 23.5% 75%
United Kingdom 26.5% 73%
Finland 28% 70%
France 29.5% 69.5%

While of the 10 most religious countries, 5 were in sub-saharan Africa, 2 in North Africa, 2 in South Asia and 1 in South-East Asia:

Sierra Leone 98% 1.5%
Egypt 98% 2%
Democratic Republic of the Congo 98.5% 1.5%
Malawi 98.5% 1.5%
Morocco 98.5% 1%
Sri Lanka 98.5% 1%
Somalia 98.5% 1.5%
Indonesia 99% 0%
Niger 100% 0%
Bangladesh 100% 0%

People talk that societies such as Britain and the United States are ‘secular societies’, but they are not. Christianity, whether intentionally or unintentionally, significantly influences the politics and culture of both societies. That’s ultimately what matters, not whether a society in theory claims to be secular.

You can have a secular state with a religious population. Since the historical norm was state persecution of non orthodox religion, having a secular state is arguably good for religion or at least religious diversity.

There's not much you can do about people who want to be religious - coercing them is probably undesirable.

The Nordic states aren't that great btw... iirc they collect a 'church tax' from their citizens and though it's theoretically possible for a citizen to divert their tax money to groups apart from the church, the state makes it rather difficult to actually do so.
