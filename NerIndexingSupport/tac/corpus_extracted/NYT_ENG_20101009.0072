Constellation Energy said Saturday that it had
reached an impasse in negotiations for a federal loan guarantee to
build a proposed third nuclear reactor at its Calvert Cliffs site
near Washington.

The decision would appear to kill the project unless Congress or
the White House steps in. Constellation said in a letter to the
Energy Department that the Office of Management and Budget was
asking for a fee of $880 million on a guarantee of about $7.6
billion, which it said would doom the project, "or the economics
of any nuclear project, for that matter."

The fee is to compensate taxpayers for the risk of default. The
company argues that because the plant's model is being proven in
Finland, France and China, and because it has a strong partner,
Electricite de France, the fee should be 1 to 2 percent. The
Calvert Cliffs project had once been hailed as a cornerstone of a
nuclear power renaissance.

In 2005, President George W. Bush spoke at Calvert Cliffs, the
first presidential visit to a nuclear plant in 30 years. "It is
time for this country to start building nuclear power plants
again," he said. The last successful groundbreaking for a nuclear
reactor in the United States was in 1973.

The federal government authorized a loan guarantee program in
2005 intended to spur nuclear power development, and Congress
agreed to finance it in 2007. So far, however, only one guarantee
has been issued, for two new units at the Southern Co.'s Vogtle
plant, near Waynesboro, Ga.

Ground has been broken there, and also for two more reactors
across the Savannah River in South Carolina, a project that is
proceeding without loan guarantees. But a variety of utilities
around the country have stepped back from plans to build reactors.

Constellation, which serves a large area of Maryland and owns
generating plants nationwide, announced its decision Saturday after
the impasse was reported by The Washington Post.

On Saturday, James L. Connaughton, executive vice president of
Constellation and an environmental official in the Bush White
House, stopped short of saying the project was dead. "We were in
the middle of discussions," he said.

The government had proposed a lower fee if Constellation agreed
to buy three-quarters of the power and Constellation and EDF
guaranteed completion of the plant, said Connaughton, but he said
those conditions were too onerous.

The plant was to have been built at a site 40 miles south of the
District of Columbia where Baltimore Gas & Electric, a predecessor
company to Constellation, finished two reactors in the 1970s. They
are still operating.

In a statement, EDF said it was "extremely disappointed and
shocked to learn that Constellation has unilaterally decided to
withdraw from the Calvert Cliffs 3 project."

It added, "We were at the finish line with the Department of
Energy and were making significant progress."

Constellation said EDF would have to decide whether to proceed
alone, although by law it needs an American partner. The companies
had hoped to build a series of identical reactors around the United
States, with local partners.

The Energy Department did not immediately return calls for
comment.

Constellation had been hinting for weeks that it had
reservations. In September, Mayo Shattuck, the company's chief
executive, speaking at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon in
Washington, referred to the differences in economics between
Calvert Cliffs and the Vogtle plant.

The Georgia plant, he said, was being built under traditional
regulations that passed the costs of construction on to the
company's customers; Calvert Cliffs, he said, was in a "merchant"
environment, where companies build at their own risk, and sell
power at market rates.

Experts have pointed out that the current economic climate isn't
favorable to nuclear construction, in part because the price of
natural gas is so low.

Congress has authorized loan guarantees of up to $18.5 billion
for new reactors, with $8.3 billion now earmarked for Vogtle. The
sums are simply guarantees by the government to repay lenders if
the builder cannot do so. Their cost to the Treasury is uncertain;
if the reactors are built as planned and operate profitably, the
cost would be zero. In fact, the Treasury could make a profit from
fees paid by the borrowers. While the negotiations are secret,
Constellation has been complaining for months that the fee Treasury
sought was too high.
