Justin Verlander wanted his 98-mph fastball to buzz
inside and almost touch the Minnesota on Joe Mauer's uniform
jersey. He wanted to pinpoint the pitch in such a spot that Mauer
could not extend his bat and make contact. He wanted Mauer to swing
through the elevated fastball.

Verlander's execution worked for the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday
night, but his plan failed. The fastball hummed in tight on Mauer
and seemed as if it could even nick his chest. Perhaps Mauer could
foul off the pitch or hope it did not veer over the plate for a
strike.

But Mauer did something else, something compelling, as usual. He
reacted with stunning speed, whipped his bat around and somehow
lined a single to right field. Instead of being constrained by a
fastball that was designed to shackle him, Mauer smacked the ball
as if it were sitting on a tee.

"That was a joke," Verlander said. "That's the only thing I
got for that. I came in the dugout and I said, 'I will never know
how he hit that pitch, kept it fair and didn't break his bat.' He
almost got the barrel on it."

Would anyone besides Mauer have hit that pitch?

"He's hitting .370 for a reason," Verlander said. "It's not
easy in this league. To be able to do things like that, it reminds
you of why he's so good."

It was one swing, but it was one more piece of evidence
regarding Mauer's artistry as a hitter. As Mauer, who is hitting
.366, tries to help the Twins overtake the Tigers in the American
League Central Division, he is also completing a historic season.
He is the best catcher in the major leagues and is methodically
building a list of accomplishments that could end with his being
regarded as the best ever.

"That's a little uncomfortable to hear," said Mauer, whose
Twins are also uncomfortable after losing to the Tigers, 7-2, to
fall three games behind first-place Detroit with four games left.

When Mauer is asked about himself, he reflexively steers the
conversation to the Twins. He is about to become the first catcher
to win three batting titles, which he called humbling. He is a
favorite to win the Most Valuable Player award, a distinction that
he said would be awesome.

Mauer's answers to personal questions are brief and often
include nervous laughter. He called himself "a guy who grew up in
Minnesota who likes to hang out with friends." Tiger Manager Jim
Leyland was more to the point when he called Mauer the best hitter
in the league. After a few minutes, Mauer, who leads the league in
average, on-base percentage (.441 before Wednesday) and slugging
percentage (.597), provided his polite version of boasting.

"It's something I've strived for my whole life, really, trying
to be the best that I can at anything, really," he said. "I
always wanted to be the best ballplayer I can be. I still got a lot
of work to do. I feel like I can only get better."

Catchers are supposed to block pitches and call intelligent
games for their pitchers, and it is always nice if they can hit
some homers. But catchers are not expected to win batting titles.
Mauer does. Only two other catchers have won batting titles; Ernie
Lombardi did it in 1938 and 1942, and Bubbles Hargrave in 1926.

The backup catcher Mike Redmond gushed about how Mauer had
"developed into an unbelievable hitter." As talented and athletic
as Mauer is, Redmond said he had also dashed criticisms that had
been lobbed at him.

For those who thought Mauer needed to show more power, he has
smashed a career-high 28 homers this season. For those who wanted
Mauer to be more of a run producer, Redmond noted, he is "taking
more chances" to knock in runs and has a career-high 93. For those
who doubted Mauer's durability, he has played in 133 of the last
136 games since missing the first 22 with a lower-back injury.

"What he's done for us as a catcher is what I appreciate the
most," Redmond said.

If the Twins were not still in the division race, Mauer said,
there would probably be more questions about his potential free
agency after the 2010 season. Despite being a Minnesota native who
is excelling for his favorite team, Mauer would not say if he would
return to the Twins.For Mauer to return to the Twins, he would
probably want assurances that they were committed to adding the
necessary players around him to win. Mauer called that a fair
statement. He laughed and said that he was "not really"
interested in being the highest-paid player in baseball. It may be
the only part of Mauer's career in which he is not striving to be
the best.

"Just having the chance to win would be important to me," he
said. "I've put myself in a pretty good position that, wherever I
end up, I think the pay's going be pretty nice. I'm more worried
about trying to be on winning teams."
