Assuming Missouri gets its revenge next week:

BCS MNC      Missouri
Fiesta       Kansas
Cotton       Texas
Holiday      Oklahoma
Alamo        Texas Tech
Sun          Oklahoma State
Insight      Colorado
Independence Texas A&M

The Gator has the fourth pick, but I'm guessing they'll forego taking
Texas Tech for Connecticut or South Florida. That means they're locked
into taking two Big XII teams the next two years.

If OU does win:

Fiesta       Oklahoma
Cotton       Missouri
Gator        Kansas
Holiday      Texas
Alamo        Texas Tech
Insight      Oklahoma State
Independence Colorado
Texas        Texas A&M

Obviously, Missouri/Kansas and the surge of fans they'd bring would be
more palatable to the Gator Bowl than T. Tech.

I think the possibility of an OU-KU Fiesta Bowl is out there, though
somewhat unlikely.
