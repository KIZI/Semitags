The Supreme Court in Sao Tome and Principe has unheld official results of an
election won by the Independent Democratic Action (ADI) party of Patricio
Trovoada.

After the court ruling made on Thursday night concerning the August 1
legislative vote, Trovoada is poised to become prime minister in the small
archipelago in the Gulf of Guinea, but he only has a relative majority.

The definitive results released by the court were the same as the provisional
ones and gave Trovoada's ADI 26 seats out of 55, with 21 seats going to the
Liberation Movement of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP), led by the current Prime
Minister Rafael Branco.

The Democratic Convergence Party (PCD), a member of the ruling coalition, took
seven seats and the Democratic Movement Force for Change-Liberal Party (MDFM-PL)
led by President Fradique de Menezes took one seat.

"Sao Tome's people have chosen the way of change," Trovoada said once the
provisional results were out. "We're going to bring this change, above all in
the domain of fighting corruption."

The results of the election are likely to lead to the formation of another
fragile government. Since 1991 and the end of one-party rule by the MLSTP, no
fewer than 14 prime ministers have headed successive governments. An absolute
majority has been won in parliament only once, by the MLTSP in 1998.

Trovoada has already served as prime minister, in 2008.

The former Portuguese colony is among the poorest countries in the world and
lives off fishing and growing food. Its budget is helped by international
financial aid.

Sao Tome and Principe is one of the few countries in the Gulf of Guinea not yet
to have exploited petroleum resources, but economic and diplomatic sources have
said that the first barrels of crude oil can be envisaged for 2014.
