Annette Tatum wants to bring the "fancy and drama" of haute
couture home.

In another life, Tatum would have been behind the extravagant
ephemera of a Dior show.

"I love that it's all about creating a 'Cirque du Soleil' for
one night, and then it's over," she says.

The Santa Monica-based interior and textile designer behind the
multimillion-dollar House and Little House lines of decor has made
a career out of fashioning living spaces around high fashion.

Handmade details. Unique fabrics, colors and textures. The
energy of the catwalk.

Tatum lays out that philosophy in her new book, "The
Well-Dressed Home: Fashionable Design Inspired by Your Personal
Style" (Clarkson Potter). She pulls design elements from a variety
of inspirations, including pop art and exotic locations.

"There are many things that influence what you put in your home
-- from what you see people wearing on the street to magazines,"
she says. "For us, we wanted to say, 'Look, this is what you're
seeing on high design, and this is how it translates to the
everyday."'

The book spotlights rooms based on 11 of the most universal
fashion styles, mixing and matching them along the way -- as in an
eco-bohemian loft in New York City and the author's
vintage-romantic home within biking distance of her two boutiques,
Annette Tatum Nursery and Annette Tatum Home.

Tatum, who is in her late 40s, shares the house with her builder
husband and their three young kids. A fourth recently left for
college.

Still, a house full of children has kept the designer from
unleashing her more adventurous side as she points out in the book,
which features her couture-bohemian-style dining room.

"I'm the first to admit that as a family of six, we're just not
that fancy," she writes. "But there's a side of me that loves the
idea of a formal dinner, like the one we enjoy each year as a
family for Valentine's Day. These 'dress-up' moments, however
infrequent, are the couture side of me coming out to play."

Also featured in the book are the homes of clients, friends and
business acquaintances.

As Tatum flips through the pages, she points out some of the
rooms, including the eclectic-modern dining room of a Santa Monica
gallery owner with a penchant for minimalist designers Yohji
Yamamoto, Comme des Garcons and Martin Margiela.

His decor is just as clean. The light-filled room features a
wooden drawing model, a large photograph of a giant tree and an oil
painting, but the focal point is a large-scale anatomical model of
a bee that Tatum describes as "gross cool."

But her favorite is a peacock-blue room she's dubbed eclectic
bohemian.

The room takes its cue from the homeowners' shared love of
music. Old vinyl records, music-themed books and posters of rock
icons such as Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles decorate a
wall. There's a mix of patterns, from the giant ochre-and-golden
paisley curtains to a Western blanket on a brown leather sofa and
cowhide rug.

"Janis Joplin, dressed rocker-style in corduroy hip-huggers and
a pintucked white blouse, would fit in just fine here," Tatum
writes.

Interspersed between the pages are design boards, which Tatum
has since translated into three-dimensional dress forms on display
in her Home store.

One is wrapped in a one-shoulder tree bark bodice with a long,
ruffled skirt fashioned out of newspaper, while another wears a
wallpaper party dress.

"I thought it would be great to show how a wardrobe can inspire
a room," she says, moving between the distinctly dressed
mannequins.

Fashion has long been Tatum's muse. Early in her career she
sought to upholster sofas with fabrics she'd see at apparel shows.

But they wouldn't last.

Fashion designers such as Versace and Ralph Lauren have come on
board in recent years with home collections that make it easier for
people to blur the lines.

More recently Elson & Company introduced a second Fashion
Underfoot collection of runway-inspired rugs to benefit the Council
of Fashion Designers of America's Fashion Targets Breast Cancer
initiative.

"There's more mass now," Tatum says. "You might have your
basics, but you can flip it just the same as you would your
wardrobe."
