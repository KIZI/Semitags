Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) believes that Iran could produce an
atomic bomb in six months, according to a report in Stern magazine.

Moreover, Iran might conduct similar nuclear tests as the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has done, the weekly German magazine said.

But a senior European diplomat at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
expressed doubts over the report.

"The information that I have does not indicate this," the Austrian Press Agency
(APA) quoted the diplomat as saying.

So far, the IAEA has not made any official statement on the Stern report.

The latest IAEA report on the Iranian nuclear issue said the agency has all the
low-purity uranium Iran has under watch.

IAEA inspectors had also installed photographic equipment at Iran's Natanz
enrichment plant to monitor its production of enriched uranium.

Most nuclear experts believe Iran is not capable of obtaining the needed amount
of high purity uranium for creating an atomic bomb in a few months, unless it
possesses some other secret uranium enrichment equipment.

The United States and other Western countries claim that Iran intends to
secretly develop nuclear weapons. The UN Security Council also wants  Iran to
suspend its uranium enrichment activity.

Iran, however, insists that its nuclear plan is only for peaceful purposes,
vowing to continue its uranium enrichment activity despite pressure and
sanctions from Western countries.
