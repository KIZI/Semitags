First perfect game of the season.
I know there are other baseball lovers here, right?
 
 
My facebook is blowingthefuckup right now.
I hate baseball, but if I have to pick a team, it's the white sox. obviously.
 
 
It's awesome no matter what team does it. Love baseball.
 
 
I get all teary watching it, lol. We were in europe when buehrle threw a perfect game for the sox and when we told people we were from Chicago, they were like "did you see what just happened?" it was cool.
