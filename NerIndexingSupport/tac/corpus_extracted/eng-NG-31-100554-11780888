He said  "...things that happened when I was three months old. " Not three
years old.   He can be criticized for many things - don't think this minor
error is one of them.

The invasion took place April 17-19, 1961. Obama was born on August 4, 1961,
which made him about 3 months old. If you have some otherwordly form of math
to show us to back up your idiotic comment, please show that math now.

Amazing everybody's math skills here.  April is BEFORE August.  Nobama
wasn't even a non-Native-born American Citizen yet when the Bay of Pigs took
place.  He was only 9 days old when Kruschev and the East Germans started
putting up the wall on August 13, 1961.

Obama is a better Capitalist that Dubya because Obama actually
understands Capitalism.  Dubya was born with a silver spoon up his
nose and never had to negotiate his introduction and entry into
Capitalism.  Next you'll excoriate the Obamas for making money.  You
just are not an emotionally mature person.

about it, and maybe we can discuss it.

No - wait. We can't discuss it. It's pointless.

It's been explained 183 trillion times that Hawaii does NOT show the
original birth certificate to certain sources. Standard procedure. When you
wrote to the government office which made those rules, what did they tell
you? What was their response? Please show the text of the letter you wrote.

He's got the math ass-backwards in any case.

Bay of Pigs was BEFORE he was supposedly born on Aug 4, 1961, not 3 months
AFTER.  Unless Nobama has radically changed the calendar, too, April 1961
was before August 1961. . . . .

Wrong. It's just that we've never SEEN anyone reputable disputing the issue.
It could happen, but it hasn't happened yet. Don't you think the RNC
would've raised hell about it before their candidate (McCain) spent millions
of dollars on his campaign?

It's interesting that you, with nothing but time on your hands, can't show a
reputable source on the issue.

McCain was the chosen fall guy by the RNC.  Everyone agreed Obama would
be the guy at the top.  George Soros reimbursed those who objected at
first.  That is why Hillary Clinton's election deficit is being repaid.

Lying?  About what?  I did not have to lie about Bush's
administration.  I think we just lived through a failed coup - no, an
interrupted coup.  MY observations may not have been completely
accurate since I or anyone else can't know what really happened, who
was involved and if it will continue.  I KNOW when something is a gut
feeling that needs proof.  If the events of Dubya's administration are
not discovered and put in plain sight for all to see, then the Dubya
coup bookmark was just placed in the game plan book of the destruction
of our democracy.

Got the book. Read it. All your sources were wrong, as proven before I had
to the book. Absent the one quote, you'd love Jim Wallis' take on
evangelism. He's right up your alley.

The book was written in 1976, when memories of the Vietnam war were still
fresh in everyone's mind. His quote applied perfectly to what many people
felt, and of course, the war itself proved his statement to be true, not
just about this country, but other "states" (the part your sources ignored).

You need better sources.
