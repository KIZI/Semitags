The NATO-led mission in Kosovo (KFOR) has temporarily suspended work with the
Kosovo Security Force (KSF) after its members appeared bearing arms in public, a
KFOR official said Sunday.

"KFOR commander has taken a decision to suspend temporarily the support,
mentoring and training of the KSF," KFOR spokesman, German Colonel Hans Peter
Buch, told AFP.

The decision by KFOR commander General Markus Bentler came "due to the fact that
we had an agreement with Kosovo institutions that KSF would not wear any
weapons," Buch said.

On Friday, KSF units were armed at a commemoration ceremony honouring a family
that lost 40 members fighting as separatist guerillas with the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) against Serbia during the 1998-1999 Kosovo war.

In January 2009, the NATO-trained force took over from the Kosovo Protection
Corps (KPC) which had been made up mainly of former KLA fighters.

The force has civil protection functions and helps in emergency situations but
it is not intended to be a fully-fledged military force straight away.

NATO has executive authority over the force until it reaches full operational
capability.

It is expected to reach its operational size of 2,500 full-time members and 800
reserves in the next two to four years.

Kosovo seceded from Serbia in February 2008. It has so far been recognised by 65
countries but Belgrade still considers the territory as its southern province
questioning its independence before an UN court.
