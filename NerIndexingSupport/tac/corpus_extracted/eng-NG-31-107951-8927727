US Out of the UCI!

If there's one thing that has been brought to the forefront of cycling is
that the UCI, WADA and USADA are crooked and in bed with each other.

There is no way to maintain the slightest veracity if you cannot trust your
own laboratories and the case against Floyd demonstrated that without the
slightest fog of question.

It is time for the United States to leave the UCI completely. What's more,
we need to completely overhaul the USA Cycling needs to be dumped and a
completely new organization needs to be built that eliminates any possible
connection to USADA and the Olympic fraud being perpetrated on the US
cycling scene.

But what if Bush takes over cycling and the UCI take over Iraq ? Are
soldiers on stimulants fair game and will they test Ossama ?

That doesn't count. It's perfectly OK for the mentally ill to commit suicide
but the really important thing to remember is that when the world is
threatened by madmen we should all stick our heads in the sand.

According to Time Magazine and other great literary sources of information,
we have much more to worry about the Republicans than ever we had from
Islamic fundamentalism, suicide bombers or Columbia University allowing a
man proclaiming that he intends to murder the world (bring on the 12th Imam)
to speak to its students who actually applauded him!

What will be very interesting is to see what becomes of Bret's children in
his neat little world of Bush hatred.

Bill, I'd be willing to bet that I'm the only guy posting here who commonly
goes to the grocery store on a bicycle and carries the stuff home that way.

But that certainly does lend a perspective of why society is built around
automobiles. Without oil, gas and electricity many of you wouldn't even be
alive. The question is: why do people object to someone telling the truth
about the reality of oil?

Dear Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Pinball Wizard,

Your entire premise is based on Floyd's actual innocence - something you
cannot possibly know.  Two arbitrators have said that nothwithstanding
some flaws in the testing, Floyd is guilty. USADA's lab director Don
Catlin said Landis was "an obvious case of doping."

BTW, not only did Floyd fail the T:E test (even though it was tossed, he
still failed it), he also failed something like 8 IRMS tests (even on
samples that passed the T:E test).  What are the chances that all of
these tests were done wrong ONLY ON HIM?  Nobody else from the Tour de
France had a SUPPOSED false positive of the T:E test and the only other
cyclist who failed a T:E test done by the LNDD in recent memory later
confessed to taking it - Sinkabitch (elucidating another HUGE flaw in
Floyd's defense that testosterone wouldn't be of any benefit to a Grand
Tour cyclist and therefore illogical to take).

Though there is the possibility that the cortisone - for which he had a
TUE - affected his positive test and triggered a false positive, his
legal team never even attempted to argue that, leading me to believe
they knew it wasn't a valid defense.  Instead, they argued all 8 IRMS
tests aboth T:E tests were false positives.  That's an uphill battle,
especially when you are making it against an adversay who is 34-0 going
into the case.

All you jackasses in here who posted nonsense that there was "no doubt"
Floyd was going to be acquitted are morons.

We now know that Tyler Hamilton was in all probability guilty of blood
doping despite similar claims of USADA/WADA incompetence in his case - a
lie Tylenol continues to perpetuate to this day.  Same with Jeanson.
Same with Adam Bergman.  All of these cases bolster USADA/WADA's
scientific credibility and call into serious question the credibility of
athletes, who appear intent on lying at press conferences once they are
caught.

The system needed to be overhalled before WADA became involved, not
after.  Now, it just needs to be tweaked.  It's currently a much better
system than the one under the old "self-policing" ways where national
federations bent over backwards to protect their potential gold medal
winners.  Believe it or not, the most corruption in anti-doping was when
the sport had no dopers caught and everything was under the radar (pre
2001).  Bjarne Riis would never have been able to do what he did in 1996
had they tested for EPO back then.

But Floyd's conviction is not grounds to leave WADA unless you know
something we don't.

I seriously doubt you read (let alone truly comprehend) the USADA opinion.

Why don't you go give more money to the Floyd Fairness Fund so he can
fly in an "expert" on a private jet at the cost of $30,000 who has no
fucking idea what he's talking about.

Thanks,

Magilla

'cause they are wack-jobs? The reality is that settlement patterns in
the US make cars much more necessary here than in other places. My
take is to recognize the reality, but urge people to drive less where
they can, and walk or bike more. We are right in town now and
frequently walk to the store with a euro style hand cart and do other
things on bike or foot, but when we move we'll have to drive for
things so we're planning for it by building a good sized pantry, we
have a cold cellar, freezer, garden, etc...and we'll just pick things
up when we're out for work stuff.
Never could figure out why all the hatred, except between the
assholes who break the laws both in cars, and on bikes. One side wants
to be holier than though, and the otrher side wants to clearcut the
country and put wells in every national park wilderness area, and back
yard. Neither side is real rational.

dumbass,

that's certainly what a guilty athlete wants you to believe.

guilty athletes have done a stellar job discrediting the system that
catches them and suckers just eat it up.

-in feb 2003 maurice duquette was charged with supplying a rider with
epo
-in oct. of that year jeanson got popped for a high hematocrit
-in 2004 she skipped a doping control
-in 2005 she tested positive for epo

every instance she had an excuse, including taking steps to discredit
the test which found epo in her system.

http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/11252.0.html

Jeanson said she had been ready to mount a strong challenge to the
World Anti-Doping Agency's EPO testing protocol, a process developed
at France's national anti-doping laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry.

"After the USADA informed me that I had tested positive in July 2005,
I did some research to figure out how this could have happened,"
Jeanson said in a release issued Tuesday. "I secured the help of a
reputable professor and researcher at Ghent University in Belgium, Dr.
Joris Delanghe. I am very grateful that he graciously offered to
investigate my case."

Athletes know they have the sympathy of the public and they will have
supporters when they take on the gov. bodies and anti-doping
agencies.

She had you chump :

http://groups.google.com/group/rec.bicycles.racing/browse_frm/thread/...

----------------

"I have never in my entire career taken EPO, or any other banned
substance," repeated Ms. Jeanson.

Well obviously she is lying because the experts here say that she has
to be.

" The negative results of a sample taken three days later [note: by
the World Anti-Doping Agency] question the positivity of the July 25
sample."

Again none of this matters to the local experts. What matters is that
they
can impune (sic) someone's reputation. That's a great deal more
important to
people than the truth.

"I know that I'll never be able to convince everyone of my innocence,"
Ms. Jeanson said. "Innocence cannot be proven."

Well, at least she understands RBR fully.
----------------------------------

She just admitted to taking EPO since 1997, when she was just showing
up on the local results.

If you save a gallon of gas what do you think you've done? Every barrel
pumped from the ground is used 100%. If you don't want to use it someone
else will and the use of oil isn't limited by the marketplace but from the
supply which can't be increased any more.

People claiming to be doing something moral by not using oil are simply
fools.

Reducing oil consumption logically reduces the amount of oil used. In
this case, it would be called conservation, but any alternative energy
source could work as well, some better.

Why does Bush tout hydrogen powered cars as a solution to energy
independence if there exists some unnamed mechanism by which the oil is
automatically purchased and burned?

Also, what does morality have to do with anything here?

If you aren't capable of reading perhaps you ought to keep people in the
dark about your inability to comprehend the world oil economy?

Let me try this again since you're obviously too slow to understand the
previous posting. There is NO such thing as "using less oil". Name ONE year
since WW II when the use of oil didn't increase. Today we are limited NOT by
the cost of oil but the ability to pump, transport and refine it. Every
single gallon of oil pumped is used. If you do not use it someone else does.
If more people reduce their use of oil the cost of oil goes down and
everyone else uses more until the limit is reached.
