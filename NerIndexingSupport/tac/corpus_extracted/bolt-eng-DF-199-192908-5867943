 
 
The "I get folksonomy" club
 
 
I like playing with folksonomy, and have enjoyed making clusters of topics in new tags that more specifically cover sub-topics to old forums. I know that others are doing the same so if you do this, please share what you work on so we can help.

Here are some ways I am doing it:

Sorting all the topics by replies, views to categorize the most used topics so far.
Browsing member's "my topics" pages and tagging the good threads on subjects I'm interested in.

Browsing the popular tags and related tags and sub-categorizing them.

Here's an example of one I was just doing:

 http://able2know.org/tag/immigration/ 

That's now like a sub-forum to the old politics forum with the political threads about immigration and immigration reform. What clusters have you been working on?
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

 
What clusters have you been working on?
 

I'm a personality cult man myself. In my experience, the chances that I find posts interesting correlate much more strongly with their posters than with the topic they post about. So what I've been doing is go through my favorite posters' threads and tag their threads with whatever keywords came to my mind.
 
 
I've mostly been tagging my own topics, starting with the recent ones, the ones that got the most votes so far and the most viewed ones. I tag the threads I participate in or want to keep an eye on, of course, and I've tagged a bunch of tags started by people I respect, whose threads I'd like to be prominent.

So not much in the way of systematically ordering by subject, bar for a couple of minor exceptions, I'm afraid. I do try to be consistent in my tagging (always use the same tags for the same subjects), of course.

Is this the kind of answer you were looking for / thinking of, or did you have something more specific or directed in mind?
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Well, I'm tagging my own topics, a little matter that may take forever even though I'm skipping some. I'll get speedier at it. I tag some others' topics to follow, and others that post on my old threads about architecture, art, and other matters. I figure I'll be tagging as a new hobby seeing where it leads me with connections. Hmm, art + politics.. it could be a long term hobby.

Simple question -
a lot of my threads are on the old food and drink forum. For myself I'm starting to tag them either food or drink, but I question my wisdom. I like the distinction for me, but will anyone who clicks on Food and Drink see them?
 
 
@nimh,

 
Is this the kind of answer you were looking for / thinking of, or did you have something more specific or directed in mind?
 

I'm interested in interesting clusters of topics you may have tagged, or ones you think may need more topics.

For example, I was working through Latin American topics and tagged a thread about Che, and if you know any other good ones it'd keep it going.

 http://able2know.org/tag/che_guavara/ 
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Would it be possible to spell it "Che Gu e vara", maybe possibly?

<grins>
 
 
@old europe,

Sure, there ya go, already made one better.

Edit: Just saw someone added BBB's topic. Nice.  http://able2know.org/tag/che_guevara/ 
 
 
Some good ones I've found are:

 http://able2know.org/tag/architecture/ 
 http://able2know.org/tag/media/ 

Tagging the best ones in there will make them move toward the top in the default view.

Also note that abuse is best curbed if you enter a couple tags (when appropriate). Right now, if anyone tags something "politics" it shows up on that page. Shortly it will change to only doing so if it's one of the top 3 tags (the number will change, the more tags taken into consideration the more volume is needed to prevent the vandalism).

Doing that (e.g. "politics", "obama", "iraq" for a thread about Obama's positions on Iraq) will help the related tags make more sense and prevent the vandalism (e.g. "full of penises" tag and other intentional miscategorization being done by some of the people arguing that it won't work and trying to make themselves right).
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

 
I'm interested in interesting clusters of topics you may have tagged, or ones you think may need more topics.
 

I did tag a whole bunch of threads  with "elections" . I also used "campaigns" a lot, the wisdom of which I am now no longer sure.

NB I posted this on the A2K bugs thread already, but it looks like suddenly you can only add 5 tags to a topic anymore, rather than 10 as before.  Not a good idea IMO ... and kinda gets in the way of a systematic tagging effort. (You dont wanna go through a whole bunch of threads to add 5 tags and then go back to add another 5 once this is fixed (if a bug is what it is).)
 
 
I also serially used the tag "human rights" - makes for a nice list actually, even if it's still relatively short (11 items):

 http://able2know.org/tag/human_rights/ 

I've also used "terrorism", which is the tag to 14 topics now (I did 9) - could become a good one with more input:

 http://able2know.org/tag/terrorism/ 
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

I'll be adding a lot more threads, mine and other people's, to architecture and a lot of land use stuff and a lot of art in various subcomponents, as I go along.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Nice, I just browsed your tagged threads and found some I liked.

Meanwhile, I found my first tagging dilemma:

 http://able2know.org/tag/soccer/  or  http://able2know.org/tag/football/ 

I'll have to let the crowd decide where a topic like  this one  goes.
 
 
@nimh,

 
I did tag a whole bunch of threads  with "elections" . I also used "campaigns" a lot, the wisdom of which I am now no longer sure.
 

Sorry, that link goes only to the threads I have tagged with "elections" (37 of 'em, as it turns out).

This should have been the link, showing all threads tagged with elections (total: 47):

 http://able2know.org/tag/elections/ 
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

 
Meanwhile, I found my first tagging dilemma:

 http://able2know.org/tag/soccer/  or  http://able2know.org/tag/football/ 

I'll have to let the crowd decide where a topic like this one goes.
 

Why not both? When in doubt between tags, I've so far just used both of them - reasoning that new visitors will also be looking for the subject in both threads. Eg, Americans will be looking for the tag "soccer", visitors from the rest of the world will be looking for the tag "football", doesnt that make it necessary to tag a thread like that with both words?

(Correct me if I'm wrong!)
 
 
@nimh,

This is not a bug, this is intentional tweaking. Let me explain.

Right now, we if anyone tags something politics it will show up in the politics grid. Now with the default sort (most tagged that tag) it won't be prominent and the most "relevant" (as defined by most tagged that way) threads would be most prominent.

But for the users using the "new posts" sort (and truly any other sort than most tagged) this means any vandal can put in miscategorized topics. So we are going to address this by requiring higher thresholds before tags are used.

So the idea is to focus the tags a bit, with enough scale none of this would matter but at this scale we need to make some tweaks to prevent the abuse we are seeing.

It may go up later, but I need to tighten the semantic focus of the tags a bit, and one of the things we are trying is fewer tags. So an additional change that's coming is that the topic would only appear in the public tag page if it's one of the top 3 tags for the topic.
 
 
@nimh,

I actually did both as well for soccer threads. I "stem" my tags a lot and try to get in the different variations that I think would be common.

I guess if people want no soccer threads they can use a more specific tag like "american football". With enough use the related tags algorithm will relate them anyway.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Robert, it would help me, especially if tags end up being a relatively short number as nimh worries per one's tag, if you answer this -

 
a lot of my threads are on the old food and drink forum. For myself I'm starting to tag them either food or drink, but I question my wisdom. I like the distinction for me, but will anyone who clicks on Food and Drink see them?
 

This affects more than food and drink --
Once I connect garden design with landscape architecture and architecture, I won't have much room left if I have to have Pets and Garden as a starter.. before I add 'garden'.
 
 
@ossobuco,

The related tags features will pull them all together, and the related topics feature that's coming will make it even less important.

Those initial tags are the most popular because of the history of topics on the old forums, and how we couldn't separate them on import (or even tag them pets, garden because that doesn't make any sense for a gardening thread).

Over time that kind of thing should fix itself, and what I prefer to do is to use the best, most semantic tags I can. So I'd tag a gardening thread in "pets and garden" something like "gardening, garden" and the system will learn from it and you'll see that pets and garden each become a highly related tag to the "pets and garden" tag we started with.

So don't worry about the popularity of the tag, just go for the best semantic uses.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Thanks, that's what I was hoping.

Also, I caught your last post before the one about popular tags, that helps too.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

 
This is not a bug, this is intentional tweaking. Let me explain.
 

Thanks for the explanation, but me really, really no like!!

That human rights forum, for example, that I just linked in, with 11 threads I already put in - it wouldnt exist with just 5 tags per thread. Cause whether it's state terror in Chechnya or torture in Guantanamo or political prisoners in Tbet, you'd first add the name of the countries involved (Chechnya+Russia; China+Tibet); the name of the continent, as well as "International news" (to keep the old forums running as basic categories, which in this case are actual useful ones) -- that's four already, not mentioning, say, extremism, terrorism, fundamentalism, history, "former soviet union", communism or the name of the famous person in the story (Basayev, Dalai Lama, whoever)...

I mean if one of the biggest advantages of tagging is the many ways in which you can find a relevant item back depending on your "entry point" of interest, then a 5-tag limit is... a serious limit. At least if I look at the threads I've been tagging. At least as long as not too many people are doing too much tagging..

Maybe if 10 is too much, can it please be somewhere between 6-8? So that you can add more than the countries, continent and main thematic forum involved? Please, please, please?

I promise I'll tag 100 extra threads if you do...

*looks sweetly innocent and pleading*
 
 
@nimh,

Hey, it may come back. But you do realize if I really have to leave it at 5, the ones you already did more of are going to be hard to deal with (and we'd probably just delete a few). Doing that would be tricky, and could upset people so it will be easier to bring them back to 10 than it would to do this later.

So till we get the other database architecture problems solved I'm going to keep it simple, and I'm not quite sure where the sweet spot is just yet. There's a tradeoff between semantics and scale. If we allow it to go more broad, more scale is needed to keep abuse rare and I got to figure out a good balance between the two.
 
 
Hum.

*makes face, grumbles*

Maybe just six, then?

Okay, okay, okay... *slouches off*
 
 
Are people seriously doing a purposeful attack to undermine the tagging, btw? Thats insane. When I saw the penises one, I thought it was just a haphazard flippancy, not concerted sabotage or something... that's just inane.
 
 
@nimh,

Some of it might not be intentional, but other stuff clearly is. Either way it's to be expected and needs an algorithmic fix.
 
 
Another cluster, further additions very welcome -- actually, two overlapping ones:

 http://able2know.org/tag/eu/  (13 items)
 http://able2know.org/tag/european_union/  (8 items)
 
 
The tag clouds on home, my tags and related tags just got a lot bigger thanks to having enough good data to allow us to expand the clouds.
 
 
@nimh,

OK, I got distracted sometimes but spent about 2-3 hours tagging. Followed the International News and Europe tags to find threads that were focused on elections/politics/human rights/minorities, but spread out pretty wildly. Also followed Dag's threads, but I'd covered a lot already.

Human rights tag now has 17 items. I sent an odd one or two to architecture + media as well.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Yay!

(And the elections tag made it in   )
 
 
@nimh,

Wow! Very nice stuff, I've been tagging for days and really wanted to tackle the Europe topic organization but you're better for that anyway.

One cool thing you guys might not realize yet is that I'll be doing some neat SEO stuff with all of this, and we'll start to draw more diverse people with all the extra meta data.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

I just spent some time retagging some of my previous tags and some new ones, though not yet on my own threads, based on improved comprehension (I hope). More domani when I'm more alert. Crits welcome.

Glad about the SEO folk.
 
 
Just popping in to note I see new stuff on the popular tags list.
 
 
Will there ever be a way to search tags? I'd be nice to see where tags cross. "Gus AND Waggery" or somesuch.
 
 
This could make an interesting one:

 http://able2know.org/tag/travelogue/ 
 
 
@old europe,

Oh it would, good idea!

Dag's needs to be in there... the "Streetsmart travelers" one... I'll see if I can find it.

edit: got it
 
 
@sozobe,

Cool! Now I can go and read all those threads that I missed when people posted them...
 
 
I don't get this one:

 http://able2know.org/tag/primer/ 

"primer" shows as a popular tag on the top-level screen, but has no posts associated?
 
 
@DrewDad,

That actually sounds like two separate projects for us. Searching tags is going to show up quick, merging tag views isn't. But both have been in plans and consideration for a while.
 
 
@DrewDad,

There's a bug where the aggregates are not being updated right when the tags are removed.
 
 
@sozobe,

Damn, I can't remember the titles of my old trip diaries to Italy and New York, but I'll work on it - I'll probably find the NY one first.
Meantime, I'm going to go through the travelogue link (thanks!) and add 'travel diaries' plus perhaps other words to the appropriate threads.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Pooh, I'm halfway through and remembered (saw a post of JoeNation's) the word sojourn..
 
 
@ossobuco,

Just tagged this thread

 http://able2know.org/topic/120032-1 

with two tags that I think could be promising; "etiquette," and "wedding."
 
 
@sozobe,

I'm making my way through the original writing category in search of two of my own, starting at the back of sorting by new topics..
landagoshen, there is a vast field of possibilities for connections to be made. I've opened several posts and tagged through 25 pages now, but I've left a virtual feast untagged. Only 40 pgs more to go..

did one of yours, soz, on writing and relationships, damn, I forget the tag already. You might revisit that and improve on it, as that seems a rich one.
 
 
@sozobe,

I did those and stemmed it to "manners".
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Excellent.

(Stemmed it?)

Applause to nimh and osso for all the work they've done with this. Wow!
 
 
@sozobe,

I'm using the term broadly (perhaps inordinately so) and it is really about word "stems" (e.g. house and household0 but here's more information:

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming#Examples 

What I mean exactly is that the tags become related to each other as they are used together. So a topic tagged apple and computers would show a relationship between the two and when you view the tag "apple" you may see related tags of "food, fruit, computers, mac".

As you guys are entering these tags, the software is learning relationships between them.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Woooooooooooww...!

That is super-cool.
 
 
@sozobe,

Sozobe, I've barely made a dent. I saw dozens and dozens in those pages, and I've still something like 35 to go, that I'd like to open and check. I left everything by edgarblythe, for example, talk about a gold mine. Lots and lots of stuff to tag-link.
 
 
@sozobe,

 
Woooooooooooww...!

That is super-cool.

 

Geek.

<grins>
 
 
@old europe,

Why thank you!  
 
 
@ossobuco,

By the way, since on original writing the primary posts are all original writing efforts, I'm adding the authors' screen names, something I'm not doing otherwise, or at least have long stopped doing otherwise. Opinions whether I should do that?
 
 
@ossobuco,

 

(Seems counterintuitive, as the information about the posters name is already attached to the threads.

I think if you later want to search for something tagged "original writing" by the poster "ossobuco", it would be more effective if that got implemented as a feature rather than going through every thread and adding the same information again as a tag....)
 
 
@ossobuco,

Edit: I agree with old europe.

I think names can be used for content though -- stuff about Noddy for example.

I've used "sozlet" for threads about her; have also tagged FreeDuck's about Ducklet. Haven't tagged any Mo threads yet.

Hey, is there a minimum number of letters for effective tags? I imagine one letter is out, but two for example?
 
 
@old europe,

I'm confused re this.
I'm fine with a member or family member, etc. as a subject. I've just long stopped routinely putting a thread author on my tags.... if I ever did. I'd rather use the subjects, generally speaking.

What do you mean, implemented as a feature instead of a tag? I'm primarily looking for connections in my tagging, and except for "original works", and now that I'm reminded, people as subjects, am avoiding screen names since I have other connections to make.
 
 
@ossobuco,

(The hamster graphics are so cute!)

To elaborate, on Original Writing, I think the authorship of the starter post is more than ordinarily allied, part of the subject... or that's my intuition.

(I can be talked out of adding the 'author', we'll see.)
 
 
@ossobuco,

Well, my take is that the author of a thread is already inherently linked to the thread. By virtue of being its author. The information already exists.

Tagging something "Original Writing" makes a lot of sense (because a thread can potentially be anything...), but I would say that, if you'd want to be able to go to everything tagged "Original Writing" and surf across that cluster by author, there would probably be better ways to do that than by adding the information that already exists anew in the form of a tag.

I'd see a feature like "Surf tagged threads by author" and asking Craven or Nick to pretty please implement it as way more effective than going through potentially hundreds of threads and manually labelling them...
 
 
Can someone tag this thread with human rights, peacekeeping please?

 http://able2know.org/topic/8935-1 

I didn't have enough tags available..

Thank you!
 
 
@nimh,

done and good work around on the 5-tag limit.
 
 
@old europe,

I found a way to do that already...

Go to the person's profile (I chose edgarblythe):

Click that person's "My tags".

Choose "original writing"

et voila:

 http://able2know.org/user/edgarblythe/tags/original_writing/ 
 
 
@Butrflynet,

me too..
 
 
@sozobe,

But doesn't that only work when that poster has tagged those threads?
 
 
@old europe,

Yes and no...

For threads from before the changeover, that poster did "tag" their threads with the name of whatever forum they posted to. That is, the poster didn't do anything after the changeover, but it looks like there was an automatic conversion from forum to tag. (If it was posted in "original writing," it now shows as that poster tagging it as "original writing.")

From then on, they'd need to tag. Hopefully that's not too unlikely.
 
 
@sozobe,

Using "original writing" was not a good example, in that case.

What I meant was a feature that would allow to surf a cluster of threads tagged by anyone with any kind of tag (like, for example,  http://able2know.org/tag/human_rights/  ), and having them sorted by author.

'cause then, it wouldn't matter if it was the author who tagged the thread, or somebody else...
 
 
@old europe,

I see.

Yeah, that's different.
 
 
@Butrflynet,

Thank you!
 
 
Hi all,

OK, I spent another two hours or so tagging. Got a bit distracted re-reading things, but not all that much.

What I tried to do was to create two tag-forums by using the Google site search to find topics on a) Zimbabwe and b) Sudan/Darfur, and tag the relevant ones accordingly.

The results were rather depressing - not a whole lot of threads, many that died quickly or just kinda underlined how little known even basic stuff about Africa is, and a couple of racist threads, from a white South-African/Rhodesian perspective or otherwise, that I refused to tag. And the longer Darfur threads invariably just ended up partisan slugfests about Bush, Iraq or the UN.

This is what I ended up with:

 http://able2know.org/tag/zimbabwe/  (now 6 items)

 http://able2know.org/tag/sudan/  (now 13 items)
 http://able2know.org/tag/darfur/  (also 13 items, almost but not exactly identical i think)

I did a bunch of other Africa threads too, though, and so managed to beef up the human rights forum a little:

 http://able2know.org/tag/human_rights/  (now 28 items)

Note that 7 of the Darfur/Sudan ones which I tagged had not shown up in the Google search; I only found them because I had posted an archive of links on one of the threads I did find. Just as a reminder that Google is a far from perfect means to search the site, even apart from not being able to search only one author's posts etc..
 
 
Good news for you nimh, I had more ideas on tags that render a individual tag limit moot. I'm putting it back at 10 now and we'll be implementing a better solution than the one I was on yesterday and won't need it.

Loving the tagging btw, I often find untagged threads, and by the time I tag them someone else has other good ones in. I'm also trying to refresh other good discussions that tags revive and start new ones that weren't well covered before.
 
 
@nimh,

I'm thinking "genocide" would make for a good tag to cluster a bunch of threads in, including many of the Darfur ones... but I just didnt have enough tags to go there. "Africa, sudan, darfur, human rights" is already four, and there often was another one that I thought had to go in (eg "UN" or "United Nations", for the threads with endless discussion about what the UN could or could not do; "foreign policy" for the ones with much discussion about whether the US should intervene; "gender" or "rape" for the stories about mass rape...).

About those last ones, didnt really know how to tag: "rape", yes; but women's issues in general? As a tag, "women's rights" or issues etc is not accepted because of the apostrophe. "Gender", then? Seems so odd a tag for, you know, an article about mass rape in Darfur (or Bosnia, etc), but it'd be good to have one tag for everything related to women's rights and issues, and "women" obviously would not work (that'd pull in the whole Relationships forum thing).
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

 
Good news for you nimh, I had more ideas on tags that render a individual tag limit moot. I'm putting it back at 10 now and we'll be implementing a better solution than the one I was on yesterday and won't need it.
 

       

(Oh shit, I promised 100 threads huh?)
 
 
@sozobe,

Oy. I guess I'll go back and take out authors, after a break - that shouldn't be too hard, if I look at my tags.. I just finished the skim of the 65 pages, very much a skim.

More ominous, is that I didn't always add original writing. In the beginning I included it, along with prose or poetry if that applied - as some were about writing in general as a how-to thing - plus subject keywords (to me). Later, given I thought prose and poetry were already by now gaining some presence, if only for some time later, I skipped repeating the original writing phrase in My Tags.

Need I add that back?
 
 
Other tagging thoughts / things:

I just mentioned "foreign policy" as tag. Here it is:

 http://able2know.org/tag/foreign_policy/ 

As you see, rather dominated by the African ones I just tagged. Also, those are overwhelmingly about "should America intervene" (in Sudan, Liberia..), which is thematically a rather narrow focus. So maybe if you come across relevant stuff about foreign policy (whether the US's, or the EU's, or Britain's etc) (and as opposed to about just international news stories in general, of course) -- keep this tag in mind? Thankee!

AIDS as tag:

 http://able2know.org/tag/aids/ 

Just 4 items now. This is one I wanna expand up next, tomorrow if I have time.

International development, development aid, charity, the economical of developing countries, etc... makes for a really interesting, and completely underlit, subject field. But I dunno about what tag is the best one. Here's three threads I tagged as "development aid":

 http://able2know.org/tag/development_aid/ 

But then there was also a thread or two more about the (needed, lacking) development of African countries in more general terms, with aid only tangentially mentioned as part of the question/answer. Hmmm.

Finally, here's two that probably I will be the only one ever using in any kind of systematic way  

 http://able2know.org/tag/left-wing_politics/  (7 items)
 http://able2know.org/tag/capitalism/  (8 items)
 
 
@ossobuco,

Cant speak for anyone else, but I wouldnt go back and edit / correct threads you'd already tagged... Unless of course you tagged them something wrong, but that's not what you're talking about.

If you forgot a tag, someone else will eventually add it. And if you put a maybe-less-than-optimal-but-not-incorrect one, what's the harm? With more tagging going on, it'll eventually drop out of the thread's top tags, and in the meantime it's not deceptive or anything...

I mean, that's just my take, and the only reason I think that is that it seems much more time-consuming per-tag to go back and edit individual tags, than just chugging on and tag whole new threads with a bunch of tags at a time.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Need I add that back?
 

If I understand how this works (ephemeral), I think I don't, that the tags will integrate, at least eventually.

Will someone straighten me out if I should add them?
 
 
@ossobuco,

We cross-posted, my personal reaction is now right above your post  
 
 
@nimh,

Thanks, nimh..
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Last night I thought I'd have some fun with this and go to the oldest topics under "my posts". I worked back to front from page 167 - discovered some fun old threads (including a few birthdays which I've started to tag by month). While I'm not very sophisticated with it, I have noticed that my tags are starting to make more sense (to me at least) - and the cross-referencing works nicely.
 
 
@ehBeth,

I've been doing "style" and "fashion" stuff. (Sometimes only one, sometimes both.) (Swimpy's "Project Runway" thread for example.)
 
 
Tagged bout 30 threads today... guess I'm going too slow cause I also look at the replies, whether they bring up any different stuff in detail..

Anyway, here's a new cluster - found these through using Google search, but that got lots and lots of results, so I guess I've only skimmed the surface:

 http://able2know.org/tag/aids/  (16 items)
 http://able2know.org/tag/hiv/  (12 items)
 
 
@nimh,

Nice, I've been following around and adding a few here and reinforcing your tags there.

Found another good author to tag:

@nimh,

 
Other tagging thoughts / things:

I just mentioned "foreign policy" as tag. Here it is:

 http://able2know.org/tag/foreign_policy/ 

 

That might find some crossover in the  geopolitics  tag I've been doing.
 
 
Here's a bunch that need more tags to make the top 5 relevant.

@Robert Gentel,

Hey! It's relevent to me !
 
 
@DrewDad,

They'd still work for you in your my tags page. If it's not relevant to enough other people then it would be removed from the topic tags that are public.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

I know. It was a joke.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

I started doing that, Robert, but then I remembered my many tags on original writing where I included the authors' names. So I went there first and fixed all but one, where I can't seem to unstick the Topic Tags -
original writing, creative writing, otf, cav, stories

 http://able2know.org/topic/18557-1 
otf is a typo, or failure to erase something, and I wanted to supercede having 'cav' in the tags.
On my tags I added 'original writing, creative writing, stories, storytellers campfire, short story writers, virtual campfire' to no avail in unsticking the early tag (while doing that kind of addition worked in all the other cases.)

Ok, now back to twillhips.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I guess I should have said that I suspect the change won't happen without other folks tagging (not sure if it's sticking re my tagging, or the tag count system awaits more input).

Now that I'm back to twilldip, the sticking is happening with a few there too.

Now it's happening with all of the them - and I've about 45 to go. Will wait to hear if it is my problem, or if I should just keep adding new tags.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
Now that I'm back to twilldip,

 

I'll go back and add that. Don't think I won't.
 
 
@DrewDad,

So cute.

I suppose it's hard to lose in the main tags since you tag a lot of stuff with it before the sixth tag.
 
 
@ossobuco,

All it takes is other people tagging to make it go away.
 
 
@DrewDad,

I mean this sincerely, I just don't know..
if you use that on every one of your tags and you tag consistently, do - say - 1,538 people have to tag a thread to get your personal "t-word" off of the main 'popular' tag list? Or just one or two per tag?

I'm not going to tag 48 tags to rid them of the word if its useless. On the other hand, I've had weird stuff going on with my computer and my not being able to get rid of t/word with one effort may be due to that, unless of course other people are adopting that tag, what a thought... (see where I couldn't get an acknowledged tag to work when I modified the url, not once but several times, getting error and it worked when I researched it via the tag list.) Strange. In that situation and in the one with markers disappearing that O'Bill and I were dealing with, I think it is my particular computer - which has been having funny almost-crashes lately, which I won't elaborate on.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Can anyone help me knock off health from first place in this one? Or somehow work in the words 'community cooker', or add some other relevant words? (not that health isn't an issue...)

The article is one of those with many possible connections......

These are my tags, but community cooker doesn't make the cut -
environment, architecture, garbage, slum cleanup, community cooker

 http://able2know.org/topic/103420-1 
 
 
@ossobuco,

Knocked off 25 of my own topics. Time to stop and read about Biden...
 
 
@ossobuco,

I just threw in a couple - and this is what I see know as the topic tags.

 
Topic Tags environment, nairobi, africa, community cooking, community cooker
 

a few others musta been in there
 
 
@ehBeth,

More stuff I'm gonna do (I've been doing this very lightly so far btw, more concept than execution):

craft
sewing
jewelry

(those mixed up with "fashion" and "style" as appropriate)
 
 
@ehBeth,

great, thanks, ehBeth.

Soz, I'm starting to label a few of my own I run across that relate at least somewhat to fashion. I figure some of my endless architecture threads relate to architectural style. In fact there's one I should go back and catch for that on an apparently historic book about The English House.
 
 
I was just doing sozobe's topics but there's a lot of good ones on topics I'm not that interested in (gifts for example, she's got all the gifting threads I tagged so far) and a lot of good ones overall (more than I want to do this evening) and anyone else who wants to check them out and help is more than welcome.

I also noticed a subject I am interested in to tag when I found her "Ogling" thread:  http://able2know.org/tag/feminism/ 
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Back tagging, wondering...

I've two threads I started about a2k members' health problems, specifically Roger's bicycle accident and Diane's surgery of last year. I can think of enough tags without putting their names in. Now I'm sort of chary re putting members names... on the other hand, how else would people find them?

Opinions, please..
 
 
@ossobuco,

Probably the same way they'd find them before, in their posts, in other forums etc. I don't think that many people are going to be looking for threads about members but not started by them for the name tags to be very useful, but others may differ in that opinion. My rule of thumb is that if we wouldn't really want a forum dedicated to it it's not a useful tag.

So a "health" forum might make sense, but not really a "Robert" forum. A George Bush forum but maybe not a georgeob1 forum and so on and so forth.

Thing is, most of the chatty threads aren't very well suited for semantic tags anyway, and I usually just tag any of those that I am interested in tagging with something simple. "Health" and maybe "able2know" is what I'd probably add for those, and I'd not worry too much about doing much more.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Thanks, that feels right.

Now here's one that gets to be fun but has a serious aspect, so, please folks, if you have a minute, I'm a little.. stuck.

labial reduction and its discontents
 http://able2know.org/topic/104815-1 
 
 
Going through the former "North America" forum is really fun! I'm just reading the good thread, and then tagging them by country, region, state, city, etc...

Fun! And, once tagged, I do find things faster just by going through the tagwise cross-references. Nifty!
 
 
Something like 45 more and I'm half way done with my topics' tags, though I'll probably tinker with some. So, I'm at 201, not that I'm counting.
 
 
@old europe,

One thing I've been doing is, if I see a trivia topic I don't want to follow (like those endless crossword puzzle hint topics), I tag it (something like lovatts or goliathon or whatever), then I vote it down.
 
 
@jespah,

Good idea, jespah. I'm going to start doing that too, and maybe on others as well.
 
 
What's with the twilldip tag, alongside the tiwddhp? Drewdad, are you adding both of those? (I dont really think the tiwddhp one is a big deal, but two is a bit much?)
 
 
@nimh,

I was teasing-nagging at drewdad and his use of tiwddhp; since I can't seem to commit the spelling of that to memory, I substituted twilldip; he said he'd use that too.

I have a misspelling problem in one of my tags that I can't seem to eradicate..
maybe someone else can --

 http://able2know.org/topic/86225-1 

can't get rid of the packing.. (and environment should be there, not sure if it's showing still)

• packaging
• packaging dump at checkout
• wasteful packaging
• supermarket packing
• supermarket packaging
 
 
@nimh,

Think of it as a measure of how many folks are actually tagging....

 
 
 
@ossobuco,

i think i got rid of your packing problem
 
 
@ossobuco,

ossoB - have you tried deleting the packing tag? I find that little red button with the dash works rather effectively.
 
 
@ehBeth,

I thought I did. Maybe I didn't, at least not with a red button on the dash. Red button on the dash?? Thanks..
 
 
@ehBeth,

Oh, hey, that's it. Red button = delete. Thank you, verra much.
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

Okay

I'm tagging (along)
Thank you
Sorta fun
 
 
@Endymion,

Whee!

Managed to combo an old thread of mine with Robert's new one on mayan caves, with the word caves.
 http://able2know.org/user/ossobuco/tags/caves/ 

at least for me, not sure if anyone else types it in the topic tag box..
 
 
@ossobuco,

I mean the Search Tag box
 
 
@Robert Gentel,

 
Right now, if anyone tags something "politics" it shows up on that page.
 

This has been fixed today. It's now a lot harder for one person to mess up the grids for others (and it will continue to get harder).
