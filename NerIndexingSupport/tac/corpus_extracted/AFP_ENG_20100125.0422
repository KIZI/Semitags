The trial opened in Madrid Monday of a former Spanish intelligence agent accused
of selling information to the Russian secret service.

Public prosecutors are seeking a 12-year jail sentence on a charge of  treason
for Roberto Flores Garcia, arrested in July 2007 in Spain's Canary Islands.

The head of Spain's CNI intelligence service, Alberto Saiz, has alleged Garcia
passed information to the Russians on the identities of dozens of Spanish
intelligence agents "for a lot of money" from December 2001 until he left the
service in February 2004.

He also provided information regarding the intelligence agency's procedures and
structures which forced a change in the CNI's organisation, Saiz charged
following Garcia's arrest.

But he stressed the information provided had not damaged the national security
of Spain, the European Union or NATO, nor was it related to counter-terrorism
activity.

The investigation started in July 2005 after CNI authorities began to suspect
that the Spanish agency had been infiltrated by a spy.

Prosecutors said the Garcia recorded the information on DVDs, CDs and cassettes,
which were found when authorities searched his two homes in the Canary island of
Tenerife following his arrest.

His lawyer said Garcia denies the charges.
