I got two links because I expected people to go 'HURR DURR DAILY FAIL'.

This latest socialist plot can only signify that the Labour Party hates the armed forces with an ardent poisonous passion. Ever since 1945 Labour has detested the military, weakening it so it would cause national humiliation at Suez, jeopardised our position in Europe during the Cold War and reduced the Royal Navy pre-Falklands War resulting in harrowing experiences in both Malaysia and Belize. Ranging from Gordon Brown going 'every Pound spent on defence is wasted Pound' during his days of shadow chancellor to the treasonous 1998 Strategic Defence Review. The continous stream of Defence Secretaries since 1997 has seen communists, KGB spy networks, IRA and other left wing terrorist supporters rise the position as representative of the Crown's military interests. John Reid and Bob Ainsworth were both militant communist and IRA supporters during the 1970-80s period, it is scandalous that they have been elevated to this position.

In particular it has delighted me that the Labour peer Lord Foulkes who had very dodgy expense claims is trying to smear him along with what has been reported other left wing MPs with similar dodgy expense claims. The Labour Party see the armed forces as a pro-Tory organisation and a threat their plans which is why they will continue to belittle and smear them.
 
 
Since 1945? Atlee's second budget allocated so much to the army and other international committments that they couldn't actually spend the full amount. £4750million compared to £250 for the first year of the NHS, for comparison. In fact, prioritising military spending over free prescriptions and dentistry/optometrist charges was what led to Bevan and Wilson's resignation and ultimately allowed the Conservatives to win in 1951. To blame Labour for Suez is absolute rubbish - no way that the 1945-51 Labour government would have made as much of a mess of suez as Eden did - just compare how India was handled.

I'm not quite sure how creating a "Armed Forces Day" and taking us into two wars is hating the armed forces.

There is absolutely no evidence for any of this. Indeed, the so-called Labour "conspiracy" is a couple of anonymous FOI requests about his expenses. Its frankly more likely that this was done by Conservative MPs to undermine Labour than it is to have been done by Labour in a obviously hopeless and pointless attempt to undermine Dannatt when he retires.

With all your talk of Suez and Belize, you need to learn that we are not an Empire anymore. We are not a military superpower: we are a small but rich Island of 60million people. The idea that we should be flexing our muscle is a bit ridiculous.

I wrote a letter about this, amongst other things to my local paper actually, the Guido story is very much true.

The Armed Forces Day which was only advertised a few days before it was due to take place so hardly anyone in the public knew it was happening? Two wars, one on slightly shady legal grounds with a under-equipped army?

Oh yes its all a dastardly Tory plot to smear the Labour Party, nevermind the fact that there are a hell of a lot more Tory MPs who are ex-military compared to the ex-communist and terrorist sympathisers of the parliamentary Labour Party.

God with posts like that you could be working for Victoria Streets spin desk!
 
 
Back when John Major was in power they used to say the Tories hated the armed forces too. And no doubt when the Tories more than likely win the next election after a couple of years Cameron will have the same accusations levelled at him.

Whatever party is in power at the time will always be accused of hating the armed forces, hating the NHS, and hating the legal system no matter what they do.

I'm not claiming that there is a Tory conspiracy. The simple fact is that, as your article states, there is absolutely zilch evidence for the "conspiracy" ideas it is raising. Its as simple as that.

I'm not sure it's fair to say that it was Labour's fault that Suez was an embarrassment. Without you Tories Suez wouldn't have happened.

Labour cut the number of aircraft carriers we had and led a protest in the Commons, Eden could of stood up to the Americans and should of threatened to kick out US forces in Britain and go along with an independent nuclear defence plan against the Soviets.
 
 
The Liberal Democrats/Respect Party hate them even more.

Yeah, so instead of borrowing a few surplus missiles from the Americans, instead, you'd commit huge chunks of the budget to missile defence, knowing full well that the Soviets could annihilate the UK without using even 1% of their strategic rocket forces?

I didn't mention missile defence, as long as we could assure the Soviets we meant business and could lay waste to a few East European and Russian cities with a MAD doctrine then we were safe. As an island nation as long as we have a good Royal Navy to maintain defence, the strong vigilant arm of Coastal Command from the RAF then we could defend from the Soviet scourge.

Though as your a socialist I'm sure you would be quite welcoming of Soviet Motor Infantry Divisions marching down The Mall!

Wrong! I would settle for nothing less than Stalin/Khrushchev/Brezhnev himself leading the parade. Or at least Lenin's cadaver.

Right. So, once we give the Americans the boot, we're going to research missile technology and delivery systems all by ourselves, since our former partner will no longer provide us with them? Even the bloody Russians could barely get that right for thirty years (insert a pile of waffle about the inherent superiority of Capitalism here), and compared to their industrial output, the UK was a hole in the ground. Plus, the US pardoned every Nazi specialist in the field of missile delivery and then promptly whisked them away. How would you even come up with the missiles for a credible nuclear deterrent, my dear Tory?

We were doing quite well on our own without the Americans helping after they had a spell of isolationism again. We had missile technology and delivery systems such as the V-Bomber fleet.

Building a bomb, even a thermonuclear weapon, is the easy bit. Hell, even little North Korea managed to build a nuke recently (although it wasn't an H-bomb, but then again, compared the size and GDP of North Korea to that of the UK). Getting the bomb where it needs to be is a lot harder. The Russians had to supersize their weapon designs for twenty years because they couldn't be sure that the damn thing would land within a mile of the target. Hence the hideously large tests they carried out in Siberia and Kazakhstan.

Bombers are easily shot down, especially when the enemy has an air force ten times the size of yours, plus an extensive radar network covering Eastern Europe (which was perfectly expendable to the Soviets). No bomber would get close, and could you elaborate your "missile technology" point?

The UK (Scotland) has pretty much decided to release Abdul Baset Ali al-Megrahi, a mass-murdering, fanatical scum bag. The left in this countr truly are pathetic, I really am not suprised.
 
 
Labour does hate the armed forces especially the Navy! RE Strategic Defence Review 1998 in which it set out need for 2 new Aircraft Carriers. T45 Destroyers reduced from 12 to 8 to 6, Astute's from 8 to at the min 4, no FSC, need I go on?

Links to both please  

The problem with Wespect - from those that I've met is that they struggle to differentiate between the POLITICAL decision to send the armed forces to war vs the MILITARY actions taken by the armed forces.

This can be applied to lots of other issues and areas for all parties - the need to differentiate between the people who make the policy vs people who do the ground work.

Maybe because there are priorities which are slightly higher up on the budget? The UK, if it keeps itself to itself, has no need to get into any wars for the next few decades.

While it is true that both of the main parties are as guilty as the other for cutting major programmes/allowing the Defence Budget to continuously shrink, it is also true that only one party ranks the position of Defence Secretary as the 23rd most important in the Cabinet.

The Tories, while not overly liking Defence, does at least tend - in public - to show it respect.

Like what? In case you haven't noticed we've had terrorist attacks in Britain. At the min the RN has around 25 escorts to do: anti-drugs, anti terror, anti-piracy, protecting UK shores and Dependencies, Humanitarian Aid, clearing mines in Northern Europe, NATO duties. And it takes a min of 4 escorts for each task, we're pretty stretched at the min!

Just because you can't see a need does not mean that one will not materialise.

The man is no use of a space in prison. He's a worthless expense to the taxpayer, and represents no danger whatsoever to the public. It's funny how the same reactionaries who are complaining about this will undoubtedly be the ones that have been complaining about MPs expenses.

True. But one could justify any amount of paranoia with that statement. I doubt there will be a hostile superpower popping out of the ground like a mushroom anytime soon.

So? I doubt Al-Qaeda is going to hijack the Russian navy and come spoiling for a fight. If you mean anti-smuggling (such as nuclear materials being smuggled in), that's more a job for customs and the Coast Guard than the Royal Navy.

Piracy, yarr  

Protecting UK shores from what, frankly? The work of protecting the UK coastline could easily be combined with anti-terror and anti-drugs patrolling - not to mention piracy  .

I agree to an extent, but Libyans for some rather warped reason seem to love the man, so in returning to Libya I am pretty sure he is going to be living in luxurious circumstances, quite possibly treated like a national hero. If he was going to be transfered to a Libyan prison, I'd see no issue, but we all know this won't be the case.

I can see why this would upset the families of the victims who died in one of the worst circumstances imaginable.

Many people have said a good compromise is if he was released, he should be released in Scotland, allowing him to return to Libya, even if it's only going to be for a short time, in my opinion is almost rewarding him.

Actually no! in case you haven't realised, the RN is in the Gulf and the Caribbean right now risking their lives to stop the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants from entering this country.

Well if you haven't noticed the Houses of Parliament are located on the River Thames... which runs from the sea. And as demonstrated by the Indian attack a few months ago, terror groups are waking up to this backdoor. The RN is essential to protect our coastline!

As do I - and I certainly hope one doesn't emerge - but having some or any force acts as a deterrent to those who might want to pop up.

Every other year the Argentines make some song and dance about the Falklands. If it wasn't for having a - really quite expensive - garrison, small air force and constantly docked naval asset there, and the ability to very quickly move more in, who's to know whether they'd have made a move?

Protecting British commercial rights, ie, anti piracy around the horn of Africa, is rightly a key point, but without sufficient forces to do so we become redundant. The new T45s are good, but eve a supership can't be in two places at once.

It's all very well and good saying "we don't need an Armed Forces because we're not going to pick a fight"... Sometimes we don't get that choice. And if we're forced to do something, we should be able to do it instantaneously.

I'm not arguing for the resources of countries like the US, but if the political masters ask us do a job, it's only right that they give us the tools to do them.

Noticed. But that is a matter of stationing at most two destroyers around London, and having smaller patrolboats keep a vigilant eye on anybody entering the Thames Estuary. If a terrorist threat does pop up, either of the two destroyers can deal with it.

Have we actually got 2 Destroyers spare? :O oh no we haven't. 1 T45 undergoing trials, 1 T42 Batch 2 in Pompey in Refit, 1 T42 Batch 3 in Pompey having a refit, 1 T42 Batch 3 on patrol in Gulf, 1 T42 Batch 3 in South Atlantic... oh wait, thats all of them!

I don't give a rat's ar se about the Falklands. It was a bloody popularity stunt by Thatcher to counter the Argentinian invasion in the first place (look at her poll ratings before and after the war). What's the use of those islands? They cost us money by the plateful, and bring in next to zero revenue.

I agree, the UK should have a credible deterrent, but only if it has enemies to fight which are worth fighting. And I'd prefer it if the political masters didn't give any needless jobs, tbh - although the so-called war on terror is important enough to prosecute on some fronts.

My Bold! Actually since oil has been discovered of the coast of the Falklands, I think they might bring in a bit of revenue actually!

Consider me outgunned - I'm obviously not in the Navy. How about bringing back the fellas in Pompey once they've refitted? One can be left there in case something pressing pops up in the Med - a little skirmish in Israel or something similar, but we should keep at least a one or two for home defence.

One's in Pompey will be taking the places of the ones currently out on deployment, and what do you thing we do with the T23's. But we don't have enough ships to do what your suggesting, which is what I originally posted about.

Yup, never mind the revenue, what about all the oil we need, it would cost us more to buy it from the Argies.

Well, just as well it's not up to you then... The 3,000 or so Brits who live there were rather appreciative of the effort, and the rather large oil and mineral fields that the islands sit on will, when we figure out how to get at them easily, be rather valuable.

Who determines who is 'worth fighting'?? Is it after 'they' kill a certain number of people? Or is it only when 'they' develop an ability to attack the British mainland?
Do we just standby and allow various terrorist factions to attack and kill British workers out in the Gulf [say, on the oil platforms in international waters as has been threatened in the past] and say that just because it didn't happen on our coastline that we're not going to ask the RN to step in?

These days it is very hard to imagine - though still not impossible, obviously - for nation states to wage war, but there remains the possibility that individuals can. From almost anywhere and at almost any time. Not having a suitably large, capable, adaptable and flexible military is no different to leaving the front door wide open after leaving for work in the morning. And, unfortunately, that kind of a military costs.

I wouldn't dream of being PM. I don't care about roughly 99% of the other political issues, nor do I align myself to any political party.
I speak from the point of view of a soon-to-be member of the armed forces who does not wish to see colleagues - and possibly myself - put at risk through inadequate defence spending and poorly thought out policies.

Studying politics - at a guess, anyway - and leaving out the inaction of foreign policy is a bit of an error, surely?

Not studying politics, mate. And if I did, and was somehow assigned to defence, I'd do a fair bit of research and talk to the people who know (ie. a selection of everyone from the army chiefs downwards) before making my mind up regarding something as critical as the AF budget.

Making cuts in that area wouldn't be my priority, anyway. Defence spending is only about 5% of the total, if I wanted something to attack, I'd go after the crooked parts of the benefits system (35% of the 2007-8 budget).
 
 
I don't think they hate the armed forces, certainly they as a party tend to have other spending priorities. We aren't an imperial nation any more. Of course the underfunding for the wars we are fighting is wrong, but then we shouldn't have been [in Iraq at least] in the first place. Having Bob Ainsworth in Defense is a bit of a disgrace though, scraping the barrel.

From a historical point of view, Labour did the armed forces a great service, by not getting us involved in Vietnam.
 
 
Who cares? We should be moving towards pacifism, not warmongering.

Yes lets just abandon our people and land and hand them over to a foreign government, sounds like a barrel of laughs to me.

Socialist wants to abandon our people and land....because they dont bring in revenue......Yeah you are a real socialist.

Labour doesnt hate the armed forces, they just see supporting private corrupt buisness that cant stand on their own two feet and paying for the retirement and bonus's of the people who wrecked our economy as more important.

In an ideal world, of course.

But this world is far from ideal.

Are you advocating a complete removal of the country's ability to defend itself or have anything that acts as a deterrent?

Sure. I'm a socialist because I put my priorities in the right order. We have a military base down in the Falklands (RAF Mount Pleasant) which costs hundreds of millions to maintain, money which could be spent where it's more needed, say on the NHS or improving state schools. There are 2900 people living in the Falklands, about 70% of them British. The military garrison alone is about the same strength. 2000 troops acting as bodyguards for 2030 Falkland islanders of British descent?

If we could get the oilfields off the islands up to production, then maybe the islands would be worth keeping. You can brag "our land this" and "our land that", but the colonies were also once "our land" - do you think we should've maintained them?

Question not addressed to me, but I wouldn't. I would, however, ensure that the deterrent is appropriate to the threat level.

Of course, and definitely a sensible suggestion. But the 'how' is an hell of a lot more complicated.

The capability to attack us can be developed in a second; the capability to defend against that attack can take years to develope.

The common phrase thrown around in defence circles is "fight a war, not the war". You can't purely defend ourselves against the threat at present, because that threat will only evolve.

Oh, I agree. It's better not to get in wars. That doesn't mean we can't have a military fully capable of defending us

I think we're all agreed that - to the best of our present knowledge - the days of nation states declaring war on another nation state for imperialistic reasons are no longer with us.

But defence spending isn't about planning for the best case scenario - there wouldn't be a defence if that were the case - it's about a contingency for the worst.

Essentially, you can argue that you want the money to be spent on defence to be wasted, in the ideal world you'd never need to use it's officers and NCOs for anything other than the rare disaster relief. But I'd hope we are all pragmatists. We know this world is far from ideal and as long as it remains so, there has to be well trained, well equipped personnel willing to go and do the nasty things that you don't want to have to think about.

The threat of invasion may not exist now - but Chamberlain would have said the same in the late 30s. However the threat to British civilian lives does exist to the best of our knowledge so we need to be able to protect them.

The military garrison alone is about the same strength. 2000 troops acting as bodyguards for 2030 Falkland islanders of British descent?

If we could get the oilfields off the islands up to production, then maybe the islands would be worth keeping. You can brag "our land this" and "our land that", but the colonies were also once "our land" - do you think we should've maintained them?

 

The military presence is there because of a threat to OUR people and our sovereignity, these things have no price. I cannot believe that someone who calls themself a socialist is willing to sell out our own citizens because their defence is unprofitable.

Falkland Islanders have expressed their wish to remain British, by popular majority opinion. And you are comparing them to the citizens of colonies who fought for and wanted independence.

Tell me if 2000 UK citizens were taken hostage would you just let them go because the rescue operation would cost more than the GDP they all produce? after all the cost could be put to other better uses, people are after all expendable human resources.

Military spending is one of the only legitimate acts of public spending in my view.

They cost us money by the plateful, and bring in next to zero revenue.

 

Oh yeah, screw the 3000 British citizens there, they can be invaded and have their way of life completely destroyed, not our problem right?   Calling it a popularity stunt is pretty pathetic btw.

The only legitimate act of public spending? Would you consider it more important than that of healthcare and education? You're developing a mentality similar to that of China and North Korea, where enormous amounts of resources are poured into the military, while other areas such as that of healthcare and education suffer as a result.

The chances that Russian forces, or any other military faction for that matter would invade Britain are extremly slim. However, the chance that we will require a increased budget in the healthcare system in order to cope with the swine flu epidemic is much more likely. It is important that the goverment gets its priorities right.

This is a common case of someone who has no clue on either warfare history or strategic studies.

In the past 200 years Britain has faced several enemies with several threatening states, a French one, two German ones and a Russian threat. No one could have predicted that in 1909 we would be fighting Imperial Germany, its very easy to look at history and say a conflict was looming. If you plan military strategy along the lines that we will be fighting low intensity non-state actors for eternity then its a very naive and foolish vision.

Compare nuclear war to swine flu and the stats are just silly.

It is fair to say though, that the individual wealth of the average British citizen is higher than that of the average Chinese or NKorean, so the British citizen is better able to provide for themself. Of course, this doesn't mean that the state should leave them be, but it also shouldn't need to provide everything.

It's all about planning. Yes, an 'invasion' is unlikely now, but it might not be in 10-15 years time. But planning to deal with such an event - and having the equipment to cope with it - has to be planned/bought now. See some of my other posts in this thread, because so far I've repeated myself 3 times and nobody's bothering to read other people's views.
 
 
Oh this thread is a good chuckle
 
 
Erm military spending is also used for protecting our interests overseas e.g. safeguarding our economy

I did not say that the lives of the British public would be adversely affected by a goverment that is more focused on defence. I did however state that institutions such as the NHS and the education system would suffer as a result of decreased funds.

I believe that it is more important for a goverment to focus its time and energy on improving the welfare of its people, rather than investing in weapons of mass destruction and fighter planes. Just a thought.

Institutions like those named would suffer with too much money if it's not used properly. A more sensible use of less money would be of greater benefit than the slapshod use of tonnes of money. I'm not advocating that we slash funding for either of these areas, but just saying there are two ways of looking at things.

Of course it is. Any Government that neglects it's citizens - the people who voted for them in the first place - is criminally negligent. But one that fails to provide protection for that self same citizenry is just as guilty of letting them down.

I don't understand why so many people live under the delusion that the world is perfect, idyllic, pacifist and that noone would ever dream of causing us harm.

You forget however, that in 1909 Britain was an imperialistic nation, with a vast empire, which required a large and well funded military force. Also, during WW2, Britain relied heavily on the resources provided by its empire, and even with this support the country was crippled by the war effort.

Today Britain is relatively small state, therefore it does not demand a substantial military force. While you may argue that a Russian invasion is a distinct possibility, you are forgetting that even if Britain invested a fortune in its military, the could country would be incapable of defeating the Russians, without substantial aid from America and a number of other Allied states. The Russians would win purely through numerical superiority.

So what, in the event that anything happens we should surrender?

The Germans had a huge numerical advantage in 1940, we didn't surrender then.

And, for the record, I don't think that <250,000 out of a population of 60million constitutes a substantial force.

While you may disagree, I do not consider myself to be delusional. I understand that there are many threats to our nations security, whether it be in the shape of Terroist attacks or a full blown military invasion. However, you must understand that Britain is not the superpower it once was in the 18th to early 20th century. We can no longer rely on the support of an expansive empire. While it may be painful to come to terms with, Britain (even with a extremely well funded military) would not stand a chance against a nation such as Russia in full scale warfare, especailly without support from the USA.
The only alternative would be to increase military co-operation between the British and US military in order to secure both nations borders.

Of course, but that does not mean we should give up completely and say "oh, since we can't defend ourselves from this one type of threat, we shouldn't bother defending ourselves from any threat" which is what others on this thread seem to be advocating.

NATO is around for a reason, even if the Warsaw Pact is no longer the credible threat, but it means little if we can't provide anything to the effort. Yes, we'd ask other nations for assistance - but that's not the same as asking them to fight because we can't.

We must retain indigenous capabilities, even if small.

It was, on Thatcher's part. Look at her poll ratings before and after the war.

Fine, let me phrase it another way. The RAF military equipment could also be used to bolster up home defenses - the money could even be used to fund the construction of another destroyer to better ensure the protection of London against terrorist attacks. On the one hand, the safety of the city of London, population seven and a half million, on the other hand, 3000 British citizens sitting on an island off the coast of Argentina.

I'm afraid you're mistaken, The Axis forces were outnumbered by almost 2:1. The reason they were so sucessful was due to their Blitzkreig attacts and the superiority of their troops compared to that of the allies. However, the nazis were finally defeated in the western front, by the numerical superiority of the Red Army, combined with the fact that the Germans found it extremely difficult to develop resources within their moderately sized nation. I believe that Britain, even with a extremely capable military force would eventually succumb to a similar fate. However these are just my predictions.

Don't get me wrong, I do not believe that we should cease to fund the British military, as there actions in preventing terroism and protecting the nation are invaluable. However, I would feel it unnescessary to pour enormous amounts of money into the military in order to combat an unfathomable threat such as a Russian invasion. Currently we do not have any reason to believe that Russia intends to invade either Britain or the USA, therefore it is important that we do not drag ourselves into another cold war standoff. The cold war was a massive drain on funds during the 50's to early 90's, as the nation was in a constant state of preperation for a war that never quite started. It is important that we do not develop such animosity toward Russia, instead we should focus on developing a positive relationship with the country, in order to improve trade relation and boost the economy.

I don't give a damn about profit. Should we bankrupt the country to keep a few people on their island? I believe we should withdraw our military presence, and offer the islanders a chance to be repatriated back to the UK (and well compensated, obviously), or to stay there if they so desire.

There are better uses for the money. 50,000 people didn't get into uni because there were funds lacking. The public education sector is still lagging behind the private. The NHS is in the stink big-time, and is now occasionally forced to deny people life-saving drugs because they're too expensive and the Americans are selling them at rip-off prices.

I am unwilling to sell short millions citizens in the UK because of 3000 Falklanders who could be offered to repatriate. If that makes me a traitor, or scum, or whatever pejoratives you choose to call me, then so be it.
 
 
I'm not sure how this thread suddenly became about Russia - it certainly wasn't me that mentioned them and I believe the original reference was tongue in cheek, so the constant use of their example is a tad unrealistic.

What is important, as I've previously mentioned in this thread, is that Britain is prepared to fight a war, not the war.

True, but the RAF won in the end only because Hitler was stupid and ordered the Luftwaffe to attack British cities, instead of continuing to pound RAF bases into the ground. Had they continued chopping away at the lifeblood of the Air Force, the Germans would probably have had aerial superiority a few months after the Battle of Britain.

Yes an extra 454 million - the cost of repatriation and compensation for our citizens - the cost of the building of a new UK base to accomodate the relocated troops - the continued upkeep of that base - the continued upkeep of 2000 service personnel and their equipment

Personally I think you are on to a winner, dropping the falklands will wipe our national debt of $864 of national debt just like that, it would solve all our problems, that cash could drastically alter the lives of millions in the UK. I am sure that 1.2% of 5% of our national budget is the deciding factor.

Damn Falklands utterly bankrupting our country, They caused the economic crisis, not the failed policies of a government that cant decide whether it is socialist or capitalist.

At least they'll be protecting the home islands, not sitting in the middle of the Atlantic. And those troops could easily be reallocated to existing bases, considering there are currently 209.000 troops on active duty, accomodating an extra 2000 shouldn't be a problem. The air garrison could be used to boost defenses in the UK, or lend a helping hand in providing additional air support in Afghanistan. Which might just save the lives of a few service personnel down there.

And yes, a substantial number of the costs of the base will be significantly reduced, because we wouldn't have to fly everything and the kitchen sink out to the Falklands.
 
 
Theres a great documentary 'Fighting Passions' on BBC1 now.
 
 
About the difference between ordinary life and the behaviour expected of infrantrymen in the Falklands, Iraq, etc.
 
 
Yes, the Labour Party hate the forces, but lets not forget the massive cuts of the 70's. The Tories hate the force too.
 
 
Did noone else see that **** Ainsworthless saying how he'd be an RSM in the army - arrse have suggested that the salvation army might be more appropriate. Clearly the **** is lacking the integrity, the loyalty, the trust, the bravery, the professionalism and just about every other characteristic you'd care to name that might make him suitable for such a job.

we have the highest defense budget spending in Europe, and our government hates the military??? Sorry, that just does not make sense.

I do not 'hate' the military, but there does seem to be an urge within the right wing to a)have a large military for the sake of it, and b)use it far too frequently e.g. Iraq, Afghanistan.

We now, in my opinion, live in a post-mass forces world. Conflicts will no longer be about 2 massive bodies of troops and associated paraphernaelia squaring up to one another, but smaller groups of extremists and insurgents, using homemade weapons and fighting as small cells. For this task, a large military is useless. But we need 50 new destroyers, because having a smaller navy than the french is a betrayal of Nelson's memory blah blah blah.

In fact, prioritising military spending over free prescriptions and dentistry/optometrist charges was what led to Bevan and Wilson's resignation and ultimately allowed the Conservatives to win in 1951. To blame Labour for Suez is absolute rubbish - no way that the 1945-51 Labour government would have made as much of a mess of suez as Eden did - just compare how India was handled.

I'm not quite sure how creating a "Armed Forces Day" and taking us into two wars is hating the armed forces.

There is absolutely no evidence for any of this. Indeed, the so-called Labour "conspiracy" is a couple of anonymous FOI requests about his expenses. Its frankly more likely that this was done by Conservative MPs to undermine Labour than it is to have been done by Labour in a obviously hopeless and pointless attempt to undermine Dannatt when he retires.

With all your talk of Suez and Belize, you need to learn that we are not an Empire anymore. We are not a military superpower: we are a small but rich Island of 60million people. The idea that we should be flexing our muscle is a bit ridiculous.

 

Whatever that stuff up their says about the Armed Forces, I am pretty sure that this last Labour government has had at least contempt for the Armed Forces.

Not only do they send the troops into Iraq & Afghanistan without any significant increase in defence spending, they all are quickly destroying the army from the inside out.

They have consistantly got rid of troops and reduced the size of the army. As they've done this, it means the existing troops have more duties to perform. As tour of duties, either in war or (mainly) in different bases around the world we still have, it means that older soldiers who have families (basically the experienced ones) are leaving, creating a serious probleem in the armed forces!
They also dispand old regiments and old companies, before going about recruiting brand new ones, wasting endless amount of money & expertise.

If Labour does not have contempt for the Armed Forces, it shows ignorance and incompetence.

Spending means diddly squat.

The government has closed down just about all the military hospitals in Britain.

It sends them on pointless wars without the necessary equipment, and refuses point blank to listen to the concerns of our generals who are unianimous that the army needs better kit.

Soldiers are told to take off their uniforms in case they offend somebody, and the police do absolutely nothing to stop Islamic thugs abusing them in public.

If you can't see the government hates the army then you're either blind, dumb or both.
 
 
Labour do not like the armed forces there's no doubt about that. It doesn't help that Gordon Brown, when Chancellor, clearly didn't give a dam about defence. Lib Dems, I know for sure would be just as bad. As for the conservatives up until they were chucked out in 1997, where cutting all the time.

It doesn't help when you have a Defence Secretary that won't stand up for their departments, usually due to the fact that they are light weights that would do anything for some power. Defence reviews seem to tell the chancellor what they want to hear, to penny pinch. This includes shocking stupidity, a classic example in the Falklands war, before it kicked off, a conservative defence review suggested scraping aircraft carriers, as they were no longer viewed as essential in a modern war!

The armed forces simply do not have the numbers not just in terms of troops, but missiles, artillery, aircraft, navy vessels etc to last against any non third world country. Sure we team up to punch above our weight, if not that far off of a token force in NATO and UN peacekeeping missions. However the fact that we are responsible for our overseas territories, which embrassingly shows up, that to fight off another full scale Falkands assault with our army/navy would crazy.

I would add, with the MOD, the incompetence with these projects that go over budget has screwed over all three brunches of the armed forces, meaning they have to settle for less, also meaning things don’t work. Basically we should buy our hardware from the US, it works, and they can supply it on time, and I bet cheaper to.

I know I’m going on a bit here, but I’ll wrap up by saying by saying we can’t carry on like this, it’s only a matter of time before we will face a major defeat, which will highlight everything that is wrong with our armed forces.
