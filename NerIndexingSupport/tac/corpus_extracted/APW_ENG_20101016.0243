Tom Huddlestone scored a second-half winner Saturday as Tottenham rallied for a 2-1 victory over Fulham in the Premier League.

Huddlestone's hard shot in the 64th minute was initially waved off by the linesman because William Gallas was in an offside position. But the decision was overruled by referee Mike Dean as the ball never touched the defender.

Diomansy Kamara had given Fulham the lead in the 30th after meeting a cross from Clint Dempsey, although replays showed a clear handball in the buildup.

But Roman Pavlyuchenko equalized just a minute later, converting a rebound after Rafael van der Vaart hit the crossbar.
