Not surprising. The Clintons are the most corrupt politicians in America. This probably wont hurt her though. She has a 'D' by her name. This means the corrupt MSM will ignore this. Now if she had that 'R' by her name,i'm sure the MSM would completely freak out and call for her head. This will blow over like it never happened. Bet on it.  
 
 
I certainly hope that the partisan hacks on this board are beginning to realize that government and politicians in general cannot be trusted no matter what the Party. Dem, Repub, TEA, Communist, Green, Whig, whatever.

Are you people starting to understand the Founding Fathers' wisdom of the concept of "limited government"?
 
 
Yea, we should worry about the career of some corrupt politician... not about our security, our ability to maintain strong working relationships with other countries, about our government agencies being able to safely share essential information.

Yep. Blu demonstrates, again, that he has absolutely no fucking idea about what's important.
 
 
This is a bad thing?

The UN is totally corrupt.

what are you babbling on about now? feel free to a start a thread on any of those items you wish, but don't derail my thread with your fallacious rambles
 
 
Looks like this story is gaining some traction. Just saw a Liberal Media Outlet even reporting it. Of course they made excuses for Clinton but it is now beginning to be more widely reported. She even ordered DNA samples of UN Members. Not sure why? But use your imagination i guess.

By lying through our teeth, spying on them, and it's likely vice versa. Because as we all know, all the best relationships are built on a foundation of lies.  
 
 
This is according to Wiki-Leak secret files that will soon be released. The files show that Hillary Clinton ordered Diplomats to collect personal information on UN Diplomats. Some of the requested personal information even included DNA samples.

Wow this stuff is pretty shocking even to me. What did she want DNA samples for? Not sure about that one. I guess you have to use your imagination. This scandal is really heating up so stay tuned...

Man if she had an 'R' by her name,the Liberal MSM would already be frying her. She's very lucky she has that 'D' by her name instead.

A Note to Readers: The Decision to Publish Diplomatic Documents
Published: November 28, 2010~ NYT

Extremely good read, I am not gonna edit by cherry picking my fav passages. You should read it in full.
 
 
Sorry,just don't trust the NY Times anymore. I'm sure they'll spin it in Clinton's favor somehow. Now if she had that 'R' by her name?...I'm sure the NY Times would have already fried her. I just choose not to read the NY Times anymore. Their bias is just too obvious.

Might get her votes from the right wing UN haters though?
 
 
Maybe the Republicans will investigate ole Hitlery when they take the House back in January? Something to think about i guess.

Make excuses for what? Do you not want to spy on other countries? Why would you want to tie the hands of the State Department?

Why do you hate America?

You have an 'M' by your name.
 
 
The Secretary of State, like all cabinet level officials, answers to and carries out the policy of the potus. Any that go off the reservation don't hold their office for very long.

You do realize Condi was doing the same thing, right?

shhh

Of course it would. She would gain the support of those on the right who despise the UN. She won't run though.

Maybe she should have spied on this Wiki-Leak guy rather than UN Members? Something to ponder huh? Can't wait to see how Liberal Media Outlets like CNN & NBC try and spin this for her. It should be fun.

Again, she needs nothing spun. What she did was a GOOD thing. But I don't expect conservatives to know what's in our nation's best interests, just the corporate ones.

Wow! Now that's some Goose Stepping hilarity. lol! You do know that what she did might be illegal,don't ya? Credit Card Records and DNA samples? Yikes! I'm pretty sure if she had that 'R' by her name,you would have a completely different take on this. What she did might just be criminal. You should think about that a bit more before you start all your Goose Stepping for her.
