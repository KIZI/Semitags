O cool, thanks for the response, Wentworth is from prison break and to be honest Aaron has a really really awful personality, just check out the interview with him and Johnathan Ross- epic- youtube it!

Taylor sounds like awsome guy!
 
 
I'm going purely on looks here. They arent really my type.

Hmmm, interesting.
All the girls seem mad about them, I mean completely crazy about these guys!

Well its nice to know not every girl is the same, but you got a bf so it might not effect you?
