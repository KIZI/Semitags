 
 
What race or country has an unusualy high percentage of attractive people ?
 
 
I personaly think brazil has a ridiculous amount of pretty ladies. In England it's kinda like 3/10 girls are attractive on a good day.
 
 
Not England.
 
 
Sweden. Even people who've come there from other countries seem to be beautiful. I think they must have a checkpoint at borders/airports and don't let you in if you're ugly.
 
 
Italy is ridiculous. Managed to walk around Bologna for 4 hours once and barely saw a single girl who wasn't supermodel-beautiful.Slovenia and Romania have really nice looking people too.

Did not find this with Brazil at all.

Argentina, however... well.
 
 
Russia, females only though.

And no I'm not bragging, I get jealous of all the other girls when I go over there.
 
 
Portugal/Spain/Italy and East Asian countries.
Zomg, Portugal girls are gorgeoussssss.

yea that's true! Brazilian girls have a proportionally high number of hot bodies, but no hot faces! Argentinians for me are the opposite!

This made me laugh.
 
 
japan. i think this is a personal preferance tho.
 
 
The north and south, Scandinavian and Mediterranean countries, imo. The beauty standards in countries inbetween are... inbetweeny.
 
 
hmmmmmmmmmmm well i havent been over seas much except home countries. When i went to Hong Kong peng girls everywhere  
 
 
Italy.
 
 
Sweden...
 
 
Sweden. I have many friends from there, and they're all absolutely beautiful. Even the 'bad-looking' ones are beautiful.  
 
 
Brazil
 
 
Uhhhhm.. dificult

I think countries were they do have all races of women. so not really Europe or asia pf africa, but latin America. They have blondes, brunettes, mestizo's, mulatta's, caramellskinnend, brownskinnend, asian-looking, black-looking, white-looking and a hot-blooded mix of al that

But I also think Persian/arab, east african (ethiopia etc), south europe, sweden and philipines has a lot of stunning women.  

yo peace!
 
 
Norway, somehow it seems most men and women in Norway just seems to be hot.

Further east you go in Europe the fitter the women are and the uglier the men are. Never fully understood that.

When i went America last year there were beautiful woman everywhere though.  

But give me a mixed race girl anyday  

Half Irish Half Kenyan...Mmmm. Bad picture i knw, but i'm too lazy to look for a better one.
 
 
Scandinavia. Hell yes.
Iran and East Asia.
 
 
White Is Right
 
 
San Marino.

Om nom nom.
 
 
Persian women are extremely good looking.
 
 
Females: Italy, Russia, Sweden, Brazil, Wales (only me?), Finland, France.
 
 
I think it's unanimous!

 

The Swedes!
 
 
Sweden.
 
 
based on the people i saw last time, on ratio, Latvia girls were 8/10 superfit

(Potential obesity jokes aside) American women tend to represent too, to be fair

Japan, Singapore (especially) that I've been to.

Singapore is just ridiculous, I think super models from all over SEA must congregate there...
 
 
Morroco OMG!
 
 
which country won the fhm most sexiest woman award? :P

Im in brazil now and everyone is disgustingly good looking, high proportion of plastic surgery though
 
 
South-Korea, Australia and Russia
 
 
In my opinion the most notable example of attractivess being affected by nationality or racial origin is that mixed race girls are more attractive. As I understand it (and I don't claim knowledge beyond a couple of articles in New Scientist) this has a sound genetic basis, and it tallies with what I've observed myself. An old girlfriend was some mix of (at least) english, french, german and lebanese and she was stunning.

I'm not particularly well travelled (as yet) so I can't comment from personal experience on girls of particular individual nationalities relative to each other - and I certainly don't accept the opinions of people who say "Look how fit girls from X are!" and then post some of the most attractive girls from that country - although I'm led to believe by a female Ukranian friend that eastern European girls are markedly more attractive than British girls; she's considered attractive here but says she's at best average back home.
 
 
Sweden and Croatia.
 
 
Chile/Argentina

I think that distinguishing the attractiveness of people by their country could perhaps be interpreted as racist. I'd prefer a PC world than one that allows prejudice, discrimination and violence towards a group of people. May be I'm weird like that. I saw a thread yesterday that involved people being anti-interracial parents, claiming that black men tend to abandon their families. I think if were not attentive to discrimination to both race and sex, we could be heading down a slippery slope.
 
 
Looking at what people have said so far it seems in estimate order

Sweden
Brazil
Spanish/Italy
Moroccan/Persian/Argenitna
Baltic/Russian

Yeah I found Singapore to be full of good lookers too.
I wouldn't mind living there for a bit if it wasn't so bloody expensive.
£14 for a pint? Ridiculous!
 
 
Hungary.
 
 
East Asia...but particularly South Korea, Russia and Australia!
 
 
Iceland, all the way.
 
 
Sweden has pretty girls, but France has ridiculously good-looking boys. My friends and I went on a trip to Paris and literally every other boy we passed was gorgeouss, not to mention well-dressed and well-groomed. Lucky French girls, it's not fair!  
 
 
South-Koreans for sure.
 
 
Lebanese
 
 
The Balkans, Spain, Brazil.
 
 
Svvveeedenn! mmm...
Also Holland, Germany, Italy aaand probably Spain/Portugal

English girls are alright - though its a lot of hit and miss, it ranges from unbelievable to natural-selection-gone-wrong, that's why it isn't up there for me.

American girls can be alright, but same case as English girls really.
 
 
Argentina... It's ridiculous...

However it's hard to beat mixed race people, we're pretty much always hot... If only my Mum was Argentinian and not Welsh, I'd be the best looking guy in the world... Ah well, will have to make do with top 10%

Its funny wath some call ''mixed raced'' this times. I think you only can be mixed raced if you are of 3or 2 different raced 50/50. Being part english, germean frensh and a litle lebanese (not far from white) I wouldn't call that ''mixed raced''. Adriana lima is mixed beceause she's part white, armendian and afro-brazilian. Also Halle berry is mixed for being white and black 50/50. Some one who has an Indian fahter and dutch mixed /cocgolese mother is definitely mixed. Some one who's mostly portuges with 15% colombian blood is not mixed. Thats means all Afro-americans would be mixed, for only having 15% white blood, or that would make philipines mixed for also having some spanish blood.  
 
 
Spanish boys and..I can't really comment for girls. I think Japanese and Korean girls are stunning a lot of the time.  
 
 
I am a proud Swede  

and I'd have to say Sweden along with the Latin countries.
 
 
Swedish/Norwegian and Portuguese/Spanish girls  
 
 
For ladies it's Italy. For gentlemen it's Scandinavia/ the Netherlands.
 
 
I'm from Italy but I don't think there are so many attractive women compared to other countries but instead there are a lot of men who probably are (I'm not saying this because I'm an italian guy   )
For a high percentage of attractive girls I'd pick Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Germany, North America, Australia
 
 
Persian
 
 
Isle of Wight.  
 
 
It does depend where in England you're referring to though. In Nottingham for example the amount of attractive females is much higher than in my home town and this could be because Nottingham is regarded more as a student city. I find American girls the most attractive due to their accent, their style and the fact that they're American (even though lots of Americans are of various other descents!)  
 
 
i like girls where its hard to pin down their exact ethnicity and have a little bit of everything in them. like an egyptian/jamaican/irish/kenyan girl i know. jheez that chick is foine. other celebrity examples of girls like that are vanessa anne hudgens and jessica alba. Jheeeeeeeeeeeeez!

What's a race, then? Of course the differences in appearance between British, French and German are not very pronounced, but there's no doubt that within what you would call the "white" or "caucasian" race there are notable differences in appearance between those of different nationalities which are much greater than the typical differences within those countries - swedish and italian people look very different and it would be possible to identify which of the two countries someone is from in most cases.

The essential point is not that the proportions matter, but that having a varied genetic background results in a more attractive individual.

Self-referential statement much?
 
 
Anywhere in the world (bar middle east) makes English girls look like dogs (Not that it is very hard).
 
 
I'm from Brazil, and, for me, the only extraordinary thing, compared to other countries, is diversity. You see, like

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
Iceland - seriously the women there are freaking stunning

english really not so much but maybe it cos we are so used to seeing it, its become a case of not seeing the woods for the trees
 
 
Britain
 
 
American girls. I think their accent and the fact they are American contributes to this quite a bit. w00t =)

  agreed, what better then a country with white, yellow, brown and black girls and all of them al in a blender! love it!
 
 
Italy definitely. I used to go a lot and always ending up meeting super fine chicks.
 
 
europe has the most beautiful girls whilst africa have the ugliest, I think all black woman are undeniably ugly.

Brasillians are pretty amazing.

It's such a big mix of natives, europeans, indians, africans and japanese. Only good can come of all of that.

I'd put South Koreans up there to represent asia...even if every other person there has had or at least considered plastic surgery. Some girls there are hella good looking.
 
 
Portuguese women are a lot hotter then spanish. Their is a difference.
 
 
Puerto Ricooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo (:

Lol women from Spain are the least attractive Hispanic women on the planet.
 
 
Excuse me, what about Russians? Russian women are enough beautiful. I hope  

 

 

 

 
 
 
Icelandic girls are incredibly beautiful.
 
 
Your average Scandinavian girl is 8.5. If you considered the average British girl wears war paint and then add the fact i have beer goggles on. She goes from a 5 to a 7.7. Natural beauty is rare in the UK.
 
 
Sweden, and the Irish aint bad.
 
 
For women Sweden and Brazil. Italian and Greek are over-rated unless they had a nose job.

For men I would say Spain and America. Spanish are short though, so they got that against them.
 
 
Puerto Rico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Russia and Scandinavia.
 
 
Canadian!?!
lol totally joking although i've heard plenty people say Canadian girls are sexy. I don't agree nor disagree ;p
 
 
 
I personaly think brazil has a ridiculous amount of pretty ladies. In England it's kinda like 3/10 girls are attractive on a good day.

 

Not sure about Brazil but it does have a lot of mixed race people, and mixed race people are often quite attractive.
 
 
Brazil, France and Italy in general for both men and women.
I also think think middle eastern women are hella pretty as are japanese women!  
 
 
Romanian girls all the way. Though I'm not gay, for men, ex-Yugoslavians and Albanians.
 
 
Again, both Russian women and Russian men. Just look at...

mixed race  

in terms of country's, i'd say sweden,

but they dont come anywhere near mixed race people  
 
 
mars
 
 
I've always found Scandinavian people pretty attractive, also Russian and Irish people have got some game
 
 
Since everyone has already mentioned Brazil and Scandinavia, I'll try something different. :P

India
Spoiler:

 
 
 
 
 

Ireland
Spoiler:
 

Horn of Africa (Somali, Ethiopia, Eritrea)
Spoiler:

 
 
 
 
 

France
Spoiler:
 
 
 
 
Angelina Jolie is also of French descent. ^_^
 
 
In my opinion a beautiful middle eastern man is more attractive than a beautiful white one but I rarely fancy them because of the culture clash.
 
 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
Ireland
Spoiler:
 

 

This should be:

       
 
 
Russian women are beautiful... mostly
 
 
East Asian countries, much more exotic  
 
 
 
This should be:

       

 

Lol yeah. I was being lazy. I only know of Colin Morgan and Colin Farrell as famous attractive Irish men. I only put Ireland on there because, anecdotally, I've met a large number of good looking people from there.
