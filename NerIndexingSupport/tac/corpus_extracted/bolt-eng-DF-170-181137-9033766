I keep hearing low to mid first round.
 
 
Yeah. He's not a top pick QB. I don't see him lasting long in the NFL anyway. Maybe 2-3 years, then he'll get benched or switched to tight end. So he'll quit and start coaching, most likely. He'd make a good coach, because he's got motivation. But he just doesn't have the passing skills or the scrambling skills to survive in the NFL. His stats are padded as fuck anyway. Most of his rushing TD's are from the goal line, and his passer rating is based on a very small number of passes compared to most QB's.

Really? I heard some say he'll be another Ryan Leaf. What do you think?

He did the Peyton Manning thing, and stayed all 4 years, I give him props for that!

Well, Ryan Leaf was chosen second overall. so for the second team's sake, I hope not. I think the Lions will choose that safety. I don't know who the second team overall is.
 
 
hes going to flop in the nfl if he stays at qb
 
 
Now that I think about it, he is built a lot like Ryan Leaf and Jamarcus Russell.
 
 
Depends on who needs a QB.
 
 
I'd guess low first round, early second round

He will be one of those guys they keep putting the camera on as other guys get picked.

But, I'd take him on my team any day

Tebow has a better attitude than Leaf did.

Jacksonville is targeting him, though Buffalo has made noises about taking him.

He has poor mechanics but is a great athlete. If they can teach him the mechanics, he could be a good pro QB.
 
 
Mid/late 2nd round imo........
 
 
He should take his degree and go get a job somewhere. I'd hate to have to see him cry again.

I disagree. Tim Tebow's tears cure sadness. I laugh every time I think about them. What a fucking pussy that kid is.
 
 
I can only imagine how bad he'd cry if he failed in the NFL.

There's a REASON he put in the whole 4 years. He knows deep down that he's going to need that degree

couldn't be as bad as "LEAVE ME ALONE, YOU SONOFABITCHES!!"
 
 
Where he should be? Third round.
Where he will be? Late first.

The problem with Ryan Leaf was no one ever told him to grow up, he was a great QB at WSU because I think Price had him under control but in the NFL I am sure the coaches were not going to baby him. The guy flipped off his home ground during a basketball game.
 
 
I made a mistake. The Lions have the second pick. the Rams have the first pick.
 
 
Tim Tebow has something Ryan Leaf didn't seem to have, potential. Yes, a lot of his stats are padded but as previously mentioned (about the mechanics) if he can learn those then he'll be a good to great QB.

If I were a owner, I'd be more worried about the concussion thing.
 
 
I can't stand the guy. Anyone that thinks Jesus is concerned with which team wins is a lunatic.
 
 
Just say my brothers and dad were somewhat happy Seattle lost sunday, at this point they are looking at what they will get in the draft. They think Seattle will get 7,8, or 9th.

Ryan could have had potential if he had not had such a big ego, he was a trouble maker at WSU but not as bad as when he left.

Aren't the Lions required by law to pick a wide receiver first?

yeah and the worst ones available. case in point: Charles Rogers over Andre Johnson.
 
 
I am trying to think of the number two draft pick that went to Seattle the year Drew Bledsoe was drafted or was it the other way around? He is what Tebow will be like, alright for a few years but will never do anything above average.

Let's not forget about Roy Williams.

And Dogbert, you said "if he learns" in regards to his mechanics...

If you don't have your mechanics down by the time you've graduated college and are looking to enter the NFL draft, you're screwed.

You don't learn mechanics at this point in your career. You either have them or you don't. The biggest hurdle is adjusting to the speed of play in the NFL as opposed to college, as well as that whole being in the limelight thing with huge pressure of a contract. Some guys can adjust, some guys can't. It's that simple.

Maybe you're thinking of Rick Mirer? I think he was the year prior but I'm not positive. Yeah, he was a bust  

Tebow will be Danny Wuerfful reincarnated.

Yeah, I don't know. As a Seminoles fan, it would amuse me a bit to see him crash and burn. But as a Jaguars fan - which is where he will be going - I would like to see him succeed.

The thing about Tebow is that he isn't just a QB. He could be a tight end or a receiver as well. He can play in the NFL.

As a QB, I think you can teach him the mechanics. He's a smart kid with no pretense. He listens to his coach.

But your point about speed is a good one. Thing about Tebow is that if you watched Florida, teams were always on guard for him taking off and running with the ball. Thus, linebackers and safeties always had to be aware of him on the field. This opens up passing lanes and big windows for him to throw into. He won't have that in the NFL. People aren't going to defend him in the same manner, and he won't get the space in which to throw.
 
 
A team drafting late in the 2nd round could probably draft him if they don't have an immediate need at Quarterback coming up. As much as I dislike the Patriots that system is excellent and maybe just maybe could provide Tim with an opportunity to grow into a NFL quarterback or whatever else his athleticism allows.

The Vikings have a more immediate need at QB and should not take him. Arizona.....nah, they gotta play it safe to avoid the Cardinals curse....Indy? If it takes Tim 5 years to learn to be an NFL QB they have time.
 
 
Tim Tebow is a cry baby.

He wont last in the NFL.

One Sack and he's injured.
