Pirates of the Caribbean is an American film  

I would have to say that 'Withnail... & I' is the best British film that I have ever seen. It is incredibly funny and will keep you entertained all the way through.

In fact it may be one of my favourite films all together.
 
 
Trainspotting

And it's one of the WORST films ever made. Even if it was filmed on the friggin moon.
 
 
I think Kes is a brilliant film. Also already mentioned Trainspotting and This is England. Notting Hill is a British film isn't it? Absolutely love that film.

I hope you're talking about Pirates of the Caribbean here otherwise I shall be very dissapointed with you  
 
 
I suppose it depends what you mean by "British".

Gladiator was filmed in Britain and directed by a Brit.

But I'll go for cast, location and funding being prodominantly British.

Brassed Off, Maybe Baby, Sexy Beast, The 51st State, Iris, 28 Days Later, About A Boy, Dog Soldiers, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, Children of Men, The Last King of Scotland (British money, some British cast, I'm going to keep this one) Hot Fuzz, The Full Monty, In Bruges (similar to The Last King...)

Mostly just from 2000s there.

The Last King of Scotland, In Bruges, Children of Men and Brassed Off are my particular favourites.

The new Sherlock Holmes also looks epic.
 
 
Forgot about Sexy Beast, About a Boy & The Full Monty.

Top films.
 
 
Full Monty is a great flick

Now I may be mistaken here, but I was sure that a film is only British if it was produced in Britain. It doesn't matter where it was filmed, who directed in it, who was casted.

Well, In Bruges and The Last King Of Scotland were both completely British money, Mostly the main characters were British, British directed...

I'd consider that British personally, even if not shot in Britain.

Just like I'd consider a French funded, cast and directed film shot in London a French film.
 
 
The Third Man is simply a classic too.

I actually much prefer the darker aspects of the Craig era to the ultra suave, cheesy Brosnan era.

I wasn't particularly taken with Quantum of Solace, but I thought Casino Royale was particularly excellent.
 
 
I wouldn't say it's the best but I really loved the Beatles film 'A Hard Days Night'... it's entertaining and fun.

Casino royale was "different" and yes I would have enjoyed it if they stopped at that film, but watching Quantum just destroyed a good storyline they managed to build in Royale  

I love the Brosnan era  
Such a gadget boy and the British humour was rather quaint

Brosnan Bonds have their place. But I don't think Brosnan will ever be considered amongst the great Bonds. I think they were too glitzy and Hollywood if you like.

I think the opening scene from Casino Royale was just a massive kick in the face.

It was a bit like watching your grandma beat the hell out of a mugger with a baseball bat.

Awesome stuff!

Yes the opening scene was just pure class, and yes Brosnan won't be considered a great Bond, but he was nevertheless a good one. People have their Bonds they grew up with and for me its Moore and Brosnan  
 
 
Slumdog millionaire, in bruges, children of men

They basically just dick about and don't really do much if I remember rightly. And they burst into song a fair bit.

from imdb as it explains it better

 
The plot is a study of a day in the life of the Fab Four beginning with them running from their adoring fans to catch a train. Every plot point circles around the band getting to a television show in order to perform a live concert, and within this stream of action is a series of slapstick, zany, and otherwise whacky bits of funniness. One obstacle in the works is Paul McCartney's babysitting of his grandfather (Wilfred Brambell), a first class mixer always getting into mischief. It becomes one of the running jokes in the film that Brambell is a "clean old man," at least physically (this contrasts with Brambell's most famous role as Alfred Steptoe in Steptoe and Son where he was a "dirty old man" both physically and psychologically). Ringo Starr gets a sense of liberation and goes off on his own to find happiness only to land him in jail for loitering. John Lennon fires playful barbs at TV director (Victor Spinelli), whose biggest worry is that if for some reason the Beatles stand him up his next job will be doing "news in Welsh." One great story line is with George Harrison in which he is mistaken for an actor auditioning for some trendy TV show for some trend setter hostess. The earnest demeanor of the casting head and his associates is undercut by Georges declaration that she is a well-known drag. Norman Rossington and John Junkin as The Beatles' managers are stalwart English character actors who fill out the cast and support the general lunacy of the film with a more traditional presence, but still sustain an on-going battle about one being taller than the other. Anna Quayle has a great bit with John Lennon about his being someone he's not. The whole thing ends with an ear-shattering concert and the band yet again running from the adoring fans.

Has nothing to do with Britian tbh, just has a british director at its helm

Overall, I prefer Connery to Moore, but possibly the most epic part of any James Bond ever is the ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me.

And also one of the best Bond Theme tunes too.

Ahh what a great film.

Jaws gave me many nightmares as a small boy  .

I do remeber the first time I watched The Spy Who Loved Me though. I remember specifically jumping up when he goes off of the cliff shouting "NO JAMES, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

I was only eight ish, so it's ok.

I'd agree with that. It was Brit money and Brit directed but adapted from an Indian novel.

Ultimately, the writing is probably the final definitive for me as to what country a film is from.

  I watched at a later age of about 12 so no nightmares for me.
I thought "What the hell is he doing? No way   "

Oops, I thought it was English, a lot of the people in it are... Keira Knightly, Jack Davenport, Mackenzie Crook etc. Now I remember it was made by Disney, duh  
 
 
Bond films are usually the best.

For this year the best British movie was Moon, also best film for 2009 so far.

finally! that was gonna be my one. its a great film, too bad the americans screwed up making a new one.
 
 
I found this Jeremy Clarkson article:

Another day. Another chart listing the best British films ever made.

The last time I looked, the British Film Institute was busy claiming that something called The Third Man was at number one though I couldn’t for the life of me work out why since it was about a man who went to see a friend, who was dead.

In second place it was Brief Encounter in which a man meets a woman in a railway station, and in third we had David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia, which was about a homosexual who rides a camel round the desert. And then crashes his motorbike and dies.

I can’t be doing with David Lean. First of all, his ears were far too big and secondly all his films feature lots of locals in loin cloths and too much dust. And as for The Bridge on the River Kwai. God almighty. Jesus took less time to die than Alec Guinness.

Last week, however, Total Film magazine said that the best British film ever is Get Carter in which Michael Caine wears a mac and goes up north.

Other notables in the top 20 are The Wicker Man, in which we saw someone pretending to be Britt Ekland banging on a wall, A Clockwork Orange, which was mad, and If, which I always thought was a scientific experiment to see if you can actually die of boredom.

The only Bond film to make the grade was From Russia With Love, which came in at number nine. Why? With the possible exception of Moonraker this early Sean Connery flick was one of the worst 007 adventures.

Of course I know these surveys are supposed to prompt debate down at the pub. I know that listing the top 10 coolest windmills and the top 10 zaniest animals are all meant to be the start of an argument, not the end.

But when it comes to British films there is no debate because the best one ever made, without a doubt, is The Long Good Friday. A movie that Total Film doesn’t even put in the top 25.

They credit Michael Caine with genius in Get Carter but for real simmering violence you just can’t beat Bob Hoskins and the immortal “I put money in all your pockets”. As a general rule, I like to watch this film at least once a month.

The second-best British movie was Local Hero, starring no one you’ve ever heard of apart from Burt Lancaster, who was brilliant, and set right up at the top of Scotland.

There have been (a very few)funnier films, but none has been quite so touching. When I first saw it I left the cinema, turned round and went straight back inside to watch it again.

In third place it’s The Killing Fields, which was about; well just about everything actually. Hate, war, friendship, hope, desperation, evil, incompetence, genocide, journalism and platonic man-love all crammed into 141 spellbinding minutes.

It took David Lean 141 minutes just to get Peter O’Toole’s camel from one side of a sand dune to the other. And it took even longer for Alex Guinness to fall on that plunger.

Like many British films, The Killing Fields was gently peppered with actors from the small screen. We had Bill Paterson from Auf Wiedersehen Pet and Patrick Malahide who was Detective Sergeant Chisholm in Minder. This would normally be something of a credibility hurdle but I was so wrapped up in the story I wouldn’t have minded if Amos from Emmerdale Farm had wandered into shot.

In fact I could make a fairly watertight case that The Killing Fields, along with Local Hero and The Long Good Friday, are not just the best British films of all time but the best from anywhere in the world.

Obviously there have been many wondrous cinematic events from America but generally speaking Hollywood movies are designed for 15-year-old youths from North Dakota who, intellectually speaking, are on equal terms with a British zoo animal. As a result US films tend to be rather too full of explosions and everyone’s teeth are too white.

Then you have French cinema in which a man meets a woman. They spend about two hours looking at one another, in black and white, over a cup of coffee. And then the man goes off with another man to have some graphic sex.

I would never argue that all British films are better than all foreign films. As often as not, our directors and screenwriters got their funding from FilmFour, handed in their notice at The Guardian and went off to make what looked like a social services training video.

Of course it always got rave reviews from the frizzy-haired critics and the compilers of best-film-ever surveys, but in America the audiences were usually not that interested in the fortunes of a Manchester drug addict. They would have preferred it if Manchester had simply exploded, and as a result the film almost always flopped. Trainspotting was only rescued because the writer remembered to include a plot.

Trainspotting, by the way, was the fourth best British film. And you can work out the rest over a pint at lunchtime.
 
 
I just googled Stardust under a British Film and apparently is. It's one of my favourite films ever, just love a typical love story. Plus, Robert De Niro as the captain, dancing around in his cabin is so funny. I think that'd be my favourite of them all. (Don't expect anyone to agree tbh).

Yeah, Gladiator doesn't really seem like a British film.

Master and Commander (another one where Crowe is great) is British, and is also an awesome film. Not the best though.

Over the past 50 years there have been so many, it's so hard to chose.
Although I'm little bit dissapointed that people have no knowledge of filmns more than 8 years old
