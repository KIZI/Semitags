Well just back from last nights game , the new away shirt was on sale in the Club Shop , the material seems  a bit thicker  than that of the home shirt  and it stretches , but beware ! I have an XL home shirt which , worn over a T-shirt, is still fairly loose , but the away shirt ;-

(Scene :- the club shop )

Me: '' an away shirt in XL please

Kelly: '' do you want to try it on ?  ''

Me : '' no I've got an XL home one so I suppose they're the same size ''

Kelly ;'' no they are a bit smaller actually ''

Me (naively): '' oh well I'd better have an XXL to be on the safe side ''

Later that evening , modelling  the shirt , with and without underlying t-shirt , my room-mates opinion is that it is  a bit clingy  and the fabric  is being stretched a bit too much (you fat b-----d ! I hear you cry ! ) , so back to the shop next Monday  to get an XXXL then ! Room mate is also worried in that he only bought an XL ! ,no doubt he will be on here later , after he has tried his own shirt on , to confirm the smaller sizes . So be warned

From a well known local papers match report of last nights game

''The Grecians played the better football, were more clinical in front of goal and were just about good value for a three point return........''

The towers of Satan  arise at the Park !!!!!

Oops , sorry I mean  the TV  positions for Setanta  have been  erected at the Park . One at the back of  either end of the Doble Stand ( probably taking up about 20 seats each ), with the commentary gantry on the half way line , and one behind the away end .There is nothing as yet  behind the Big Bank goal . I am told that these will be permanent fixtures for the next 3 years ( or however long their contract lasts )
