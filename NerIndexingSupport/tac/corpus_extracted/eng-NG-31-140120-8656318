winning percentage.
The Oakland A's were 272-214 in that same time span (.560).
In essence, Zito wasn't as good as his ball club.

In 2007, Zito is 9-12 for the San Francisco Giants, for a .429 winning
percentage.
The San Francisco Giants are 64-78 in this season (.451).
In essence, Zito still isn't as good as his ball club.

Some things you can just count on.

Yet, Barry Zito is not on the Oakland A's this year, and the team is
69-74 for a .483 winning percentage over that same time span.

Apparently, the A's aren't as good without Zito, either.

Yeah, getting rid of Zito really helped the A's in their playoff run
this year.

No, cause you lose points for not trolling the Giants group.  Birds of a

With Zito, they've been yearly contenders; from now on, they might suck for
a while.  :-)

Well, golly.

Why, to hear some A's fans talk about it, the A's were going in a
completely opposite direction from the Giants, having this lights-out
minor league organization that was going to -- at the very least --
dominate Bay Area baseball for years to come.

To educate the witless wonder that is Gary Rosen:

"The A's have used an Oakland-record and a majors-leading 51 players
this season and have used the disabled list 22 times, tying an Oakland
record set in 1992. The 22 players on the DL have combined to miss
1,039 games this season. Nine players are currently on the DL."

I am sure they were all hurt by Barry's departure ...

Call me in ten years if the sheeple are still using that ERA+ stat.
Until then, it doesn't mean much, doesn't mean anything at all (props
to Sarah M.).

Yes, I don't think a record number of injuries has had anything to do
with the A's demise in 2007:

Furthermore, the A's went 5-1 against the Giants, even though the
Giants have been quite healthier in 2007:

Didn't the A's beat the Giants five times out of six this year?
Haven't they beaten the Giants 34 times in 62 interleague games?
Didn't they sweep the Giants in the 1989 World Series?

Dude, the A's have been dominating Bay Area baseball since they moved
there in 1968. Or maybe you've forgotten the 14 division titles, the
six pennants and the four World Series championships ...

What do the Giants have?

Oh yeah ... NOTHING.

Whoa!  What sort of reward would you prefer for that accomplishment, a
brownie button or some bozo hair?

 

No shit?  Doesn't that mean that they lost 28 times?

 

Oh 1989, is it?  Well, if you want to go back to 1905, the Giants took
the A's 4 out of 5 in THAT World Series.

 

Right, right -- against other American League teams.  And the
1869-1870 Cincinnatti Reds won 130 games in a row, which hasn't been
duplicated since -- so they must be the greatest team of all time.

 

A new ballpark, a lot more love, and a permanent home in the
metropolitan San Francisco Bay Area.

But all of this is beside the point anyway.  The point was that the
A's were supposed to have a vastly superior farm system that was
supposed to enable them to dominate NOW -- not back in the Stone Age.

If it weren't for the A's 'roid-tainted WS "win" in 1989 they'd have
a longer drought than the Giants.
