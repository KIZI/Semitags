Vajpayee and Bush are sitting in a bar...

A guy walks in and asks the barman, "Isn't that Bush and Vajpayee?" .
The barman says "Yes, thats them." So the guy walks over and
says,"Hello, what are u guys doing?"

Bush says, "We're planning world war 3" Guy says, "Really? What's
going to happen?"
Vajpayee says, "Well, we're going to kill 14 million Pakistanis and
one bicycle repairman."

The guy exclaimed, "A bicycle repairman?!!!"

Vajpayee turns to Bush and says, "See, I told you no-one would worry
about the 14 million Pakistanis!"

BE PATRIOTIC â€“ Happy Independence Day

Of course, nobody would care about 14 million anything...
Its BICYCLE REPAIRMAN you're going to destroy.
