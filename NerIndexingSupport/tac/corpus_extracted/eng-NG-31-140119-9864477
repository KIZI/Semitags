Did Heysel Spoil Evertons Progress?

As i keep hearing from bitter Evertonians, they blame Heysel for them
not going into the European cup.

I know this is a sore subject but do you think Everton would of won it ?

That is open to  debate. Anything can happen in a *cup* *competition*.
What is not open to debate is that the thuggery of Liverpool fans denied
them the chance of doing so.

A lot of English clubs were denied chances of silver due to the
inability of Liverpoool fans to behave like civilised human beings.

If Liverpool had been banned for a comparable time in the 70's/80's  ie
77-81 would they have won  if *they* *had* entered? Possibly is the best
answer one can give.
In reality Liverpool  would only be able to boast 2 European
cup/Champions league trophies.

Liverpool  supporters constant boasting about their Champions
league/European success can be equated to a rapist boasting to his
victims about his jackpot win on the lottery  ie highly objectionable
and distateful.

Whatever one thinks of Manchester United fans,and they can be right
arrogant/glory hunting  pricks at times, Manchester United's successes
are not tainted by the loutish behaviour of their fans denying other
clubs the chance of success.

You say that as if Liverpool Football Club and the vast majority of
Liverpool fans were responsible.

The ban and the reasons behind it, affected us far more than it affected
them.

We were banned from 1986 - 1992, in that time, the following domestic
honours were won and hence chances of european football missed.

1986 League - Liverpool
1986 FA Cup - Liverpool
1987 League - Everton
1987 FA Cup - Coventry
!988 League - Liverpool
1988 FA Cup - Wimbledon
1989 League - Arsenal
1989 FA Cup - Liverpool
1990 League - Liverpool
1990 FA Cup - United
1991 League - Arsenal
1991 FA Cup - Tottenham

Back in the days when ONLY champions qualified for the European cup,
Everton would have had ONE bite at the cherry. Liverpool would have had
THREE and ONE in the cup winners cup.

Arsenal would have had TWO goes, but coonsidering at the time (1985) we
were in our 5th final, had won the trophy the year before and indeed won
it 4 times in the previous 7 years, whilst neither Everton or Arsenal
had even been to a final, I think having qualified, we would have had a
better chance, thus we lost out a hell of a lot more.

It just shows the ignorance and lack of football knowledge from our
little blue neighbours, after all, they are just a small club from Kirkby.

I thank you.

A very good point, although wasted on LFC fans whose only priority is
glory hunting.

I for one felt it was disgraceful that Liverpool continued their FA
Cup campaign after Hillsborough.  It was suggested that Liverpool
reture from the competition in tribute to those who died, therefore
ensuring the record books would always quote this unselfish act for
evermore and people wouldn't forget the 96 who died.  Yet Dalglish
told us 'The supporters want us to carry on and win the cup', well of
course they did, that's cos they're glory hunting tw@ts, everyone one
of the, and even before the dead had been buried their supporters were
thinking about the next game - disgraceful!

The ban was a result of the political leadership of the time. 4 Man Utd fans
will be spending the next year or 2 in prison following trouble in Roma last
week. In 1985 that would have been headline news for a week - it barely made
Radio 5's bulletin. Those fans were probably guilty of wrong place, wrong
time syndrome. I'm not going to excuse what happened at Heysel, but to blame
all LFC fans for it, would be to blame all Manc fans for hooliganism in
Europe last week. More Manc fans were stabbed by the Roma fans - barely got
a mention.

How Italina clubs have evaded a ban is purely down to the political (both
national and UEFA-wise) climate. Football is so much bigger now than in the
80's, and Thatcher will soon be in her grave (well it is Christmas).

In article <ZLMbj.6465$ou3.4 ... @newsfe4-win.ntli.net>, n ... @none.com
says...

 

And despite of looking at the real facts. ie The Juventus thugs who
where throwing bits of concrete at Liverpool fans, the fact that the
Liverpool fans charged at the Juventus fans, who in turn ran and caused
a crush and a wall to collapse. The latter of the last bit is probably
even more damning for UEFA, as they decided to stage the game in a
stadium that was not fit for purpose. Building reports at the time
showed that the concrete in it was rotting and it was a disaster waiting
to happen. Banning Liverpool FC & all other English clubs from the
competition was UEFA's way of moving the blame away from their bad
decision making in choosing the stadium. One thing that Heysel & the
subsequent ban did for English football was force the English FA &
Police force to clean up our game on the terraces. We've probably now
got the best fans in Europe as very few incidents of a violent nature if
any take place in England every week. One only has to cast an eye toward
Europe and the problems still haunting them with hooliganism. So instead
of fans of other English clubs moaning about the ban, they should think
to themselves, perhaps there was a reason all clubs & not just Liverpool
got banned.

So to summarise, the disaster was caused because Juventus fans threw
concrete, because Juventus fans ran and made a wall collapse, because
UEFA chose the wrong stadium. because the concrete in the wall was
faulty... I'm surprised you haven't even mentioned that it was Chelsea
fans pretending to be Liverpool fans who started it.!

FFS not once do you accept that this was the fault of Liverpool fans,
what the fcuk is wrong with you that you can't accept even a modicum
of blame on behalf of your 'fans'?  No wonder kopites are despised
throughout Europe!

Hasty generalisation. There are millions of Liverpool fans - only a
relative small number have ever committed extreme acts of violence.

 

Post hoc bullshit. The only thing Liverpool supporters (who were not
involved in fighting) have to be ashamed of, is the consequences of
numerous criminal offences committed by their fellow 'supporters' on
the day of the 1985 final itself.

 

Manchester United (and several other clubs) had a strong contingent of
thugs who reeked havoc in numerous British cities during the 1970 and
1980s. If your fallacious reasoning was applied evenly, you would not
be so quick to absolve the entire club of blame, just because chance
consequences were not as severe.

Prejudiced and dense.

well bernie, heres a little story for you. On the night of Hillsborough, I
was at a mates, and Everton Fan, who
lived in Lancaster Street in walton. We went toi his local, the prince
Arthur or Albert, on Rice Lane. It was
full of Everton fans celebrating the disaster. How ? Well, a Hillsborough
top ten on the Juke Box, and some
fat bastard running around with the rack out of one of those bar mounted
pie warmers pressed to his face
shouting "help me brucie".

My mate, a true Evertonian, told them to fuck of, and we left the pub. I saw
your scum for what they
are that night. Horrible, bitter little bastards.

With the shite you post, any one of the little fuckers could well be you

Do you think that the scum that post in here from Everton and the Mancs are
true representations of their fans in general? Likewise some of the fuckwits
that post from us in their groups.

In any group, you'll get a few arseholes, the majority are a different breed
altogether.

Utter rubbish!  And any scouser (which I'm guessing you're not) knows
it!

I was at the other semi-final that day and on the drive back there was
total silence in our car because all 5 of us knew at least one person
who had gone to Hillsborough.  And when we stopped at the motorway
services the reaction from other Evertonions was the same, everyone
was concerned, some of them had brothers who had gone to Hillsborough
and were distraught.

If you were a true scouser you'd know that when cars arrive at derby
games both blues and reds get out of the same cars, I regularly travel
with reds to derby games because I have several friends and family
members who are reds.  On Merseyside there's no such thing as a 'blue'
or a 'red' family, there'll always be one or two family members who
will go against family tradition and support the other side.  So to
say an entire pub was in celebration is complete and utter bollocks,
any knobheads doing what you said they did would have had their
fcuking heads kicked in within seconds!  Your story is exactly what
you said it was - a story, and you must be pretty fcuked up in the
head to even think of something like that.

I see that someone else, a Liverpool supporter in fact, has already
responded and said they don't believe you either.  You should be
ashamed of yourself for making up such a pack of lies!

I dont wish to get into a debate about this, and I only mentioned it because
I was angered by a post.
The events I described, happened, exactly as described. You may find that
hard to accept, or believe,
and thats your perogative, but I am not in the habit of lying or inventing
stuff like this. No, I am not
from Liverpool, I am born and bred St Helens but a life long Liverpool Fan
(I'm 47 this summer) and with
a wife whose a born and bred scouser, and reds fan. I will say no more on
