If you've ever won a Grammy, or one of
tennis' Grand Slams, the Miami Dolphins' organization is vitally
interested in having you as a part of the family, right up to the
point of rolling out the orange carpet every time you pull up to
the stadium.

On the other hand, if NFL Defensive Player of the Year is the
biggest title you can boast, well, don't let the turnstile hit you
in the hip pads on the way out.

That's been the message, again and again, to Jason Taylor. As
the greatest defensive player in franchise history and the league's
active leader in career sacks, he just didn't want to believe that
it applied to him.

Tuesday, with his decision to take the New York Jets' lucrative
free-agent offer, JT finally gave up on playing out his remaining
NFL days in Miami, and finally gave in on the endless staring
contest with Bill Parcells. Taylor ran out of energy to resist the
overtures of a hated rival with a loving new tone.

Nothing left to do now but reflect on all the near-misses in his
spectacular Miami career, which cruelly coincided with a long and
mediocre stretch for the team itself.

Three playoff victories in a dozen Dolphin seasons, that's about
as tough as it gets for a player who had such a smoldering drive to
win.

One AFC East title, in 2000, and that season ended in the only
shutout loss in Miami post-season history, 27-0 at Oakland.

One victory, period, in the brutal season of 2007. JT started
every game for Cam Cameron that year, running out a string of 130
consecutive starts that no one in this franchise has ever topped
and ringing up 11 sacks to lead, as always, whoever in the locker
room was interested in following.

He left soon thereafter, with regret, traded to what looked like
a better team in Washington and, naturally, that was when Miami
finally decided to get things straightened out, going 11-5 and
winning the division for rookie coach Tony Sparano.

Oh, sure, there were fun times, too, with brother-in-law Zach
Thomas matching Taylor's intensity on the field for a decade and
frequently celebrating their individual successes together at the
Pro Bowl in Honolulu. Having Dan Marino as a teammate for three
years wasn't half bad, either.

Where, though, was the fulfillment with an organization that
previously wore a reputation for post-season consistency? Gone with
the Don Shula years, apparently, for Taylor never got the chance to
play for him.

Those two really would have hit it off. Shula believed in
dominating the line of scrimmage and dared any other coach to come
up with a winning strategy more certain. Taylor made his living on
the same principle. Like Bill Stanfill, the other titanic defensive
end in Dolphins lore, JT could be counted upon each season to turn
a handful of games Miami's way, even when the offense wasn't up to
the task.

Taylor scored nine Miami touchdowns through the years, three on
interception returns and an NFL-record total of six on fumble
returns. The Dolphins were 8-1 when Jason scored, including a win
last November at the Meadowlands. Taylor returned a fumble 48 yards
for a touchdown against the Jets and crowed afterwards about how
wonderful it was to do so on Miami's last trip to Giants Stadium,
which he called a "hellhole."

The wearing of that dreaded green goes now with the spending of
the Jets' green for Taylor, who needed to get something done before
the draft begins Thursday. If Miami was liable to take a
pass-rushing specialist in the first round, so were the Jets.

Can Jason summon up the same sort of bile for Miami as he did
for the Jets when the teams meet twice in 2010? Given the cold
shoulder he got from Parcells and the passion to win a Super Bowl
before he's done, the answer might just be yes.

This ugliness will pass, however, and one day Taylor, 35, will
be back in Miami as a retired player, picking up the charitable
work that made him a whole different kind of hero in South Florida.
He'll be digging around for a Dolphins cap, too, to wear at his Pro
Football Hall of Fame induction.

Parcells will have packed up and moved on to another project by
then, leaving it to another Dolphins regime to put Jason Taylor's
name on the Ring of Honor at Sun Life Stadium.

He belongs up there, without a doubt, with the full
orange-carpet treatment.

If this franchise doesn't finally get that part right, it will
be as petulant a response as the inevitable cries of "traitor"
that JT will hear from the most short-sighted of Miami fans.
