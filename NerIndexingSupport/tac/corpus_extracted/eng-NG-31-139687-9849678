Marcus Roberts applies for admission to Texas Tech University

I have decided to apply for admission to Texas Tech University, as a
visiting undergraduate student. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree
from the Georgia Institute of Technology. I want to work with the
Chess program. I am also filing a civil rights complaint with the
United States Department of Justice, because Paul Troung has
threatened to kill me.

This is a truly inspired tactic.

Next, you might obtain a temporary restraining order, which should
remain in effect until Paul's assault charges are fully addressed.

Also, you might strengthen your web presence with a home page on
ttu.edu

Good Luck
:-)

After Virginia Tech, I'd think colleges would be more careful in who
they admit.

I would love to see people defame my character on an application to
TTU. The suggestion that I am a mass murderer will just add more money
to the verdict. You people will stop at nothing to get your way. I
will print out this, and include it on my applicaiton, and complaint
to the United States Department of Justice.

I suggest that the logical repsone from Texas Tech would be to cancel
the entire Chess Program, rather than deal with suggestions that I am
a mass murderer.

You represent a clique of cowards, that will stop at nothing, to hide
your criminal threats to kill. Even FIDE is amazed at the lengths that
you go to.

No one is suggesting that you're a mass murdered, Marcus. Just a
barking moonbat.

Tell Susan Polgar to be working on her resume. I heard that the job
market for chess coaches is difficult, given
her husbands desire to kill me and the Prime Minster of St Kitts and
Nevis...

By any chance do St Kitts and Nevis suffer from a severe environmental
problem that would involve massive exposure to mercury fumes?

You just have Paul Troung fly down to Bassterre and ask about that. I
am certain
a warm and friendly delegation awaits him!
