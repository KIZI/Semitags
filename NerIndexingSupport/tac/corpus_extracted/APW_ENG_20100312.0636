Pakistan has announced a 15-member squad but did not name a captain for next month's World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies.

Chief selector Mohsin Khan said on Friday that naming a captain "is the domain of the PCB chairman (Ijaz Butt)" who will name the skipper later.

The squad includes Shahid Afridi, Umar Akmal and Kamran Akmal, who were fined by the Pakistan Cricket Board on Wednesday for discipline violations during the team's tour of Australia.

Shoaib Malik and Rana Naved were not considered for selection after both were banned by the PCB for one year and fined two million rupees ($23,500) for unspecified discipline violations.
