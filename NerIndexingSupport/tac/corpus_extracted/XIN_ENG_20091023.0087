Singapore's consumer price index (CPI) in September reported a 0.4 percent year-
on-year drop, the Singapore Department of Statistics (SDS) said on Friday.

The fall was mainly due to lower costs of housing, "recreation and others" and
transport and communications.

Housing cost went down by 2.5 percent owing to lower electricity and gas tariffs
as well as cheaper liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).Excluding accommodation costs,
the consumer price index dipped by 0.9 percent in September.

The consumer price index for the first nine months of this year was 0.4 percent
higher compared with the same period of previous year. Excluding accommodation
costs, the consumer price index fell by 0.5 percent during the same period.

For the whole year of 2009, the ministry said the forecast for CPI inflation is
maintained at minus 1.0 to 0 percent.

CPI is one of the major indicators of inflation.It measures the change in the
prices of a fixed basket of goods and services commonly purchased by the
majority of households.
