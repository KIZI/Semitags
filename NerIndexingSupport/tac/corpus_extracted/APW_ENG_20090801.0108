Former IBF lightweight champion Julio Diaz lost a unanimous decision to undefeated Victor Cayo in a junior welterweight non-title bout on Friday.

Cayo, of the Dominican Republic, frustrated Diaz with fast combinations during the 10-round fight.

Early in the fight, the 24-year old Cayo was intent on scoring from the outside as he landed solid left jabs and left hooks to the head.

Diaz finally cut punching range in the fifth round and was effective with combinations to the body. But Cayo took Diaz's best shots from short range and countered with rights to the head.

All three judges scored the bout for Cayo, 97-93, 96-94 and 98-92. There were no knockdowns.

Diaz, of Mexico, won the IBF lightweight title in 2004 with a split decision against Javier Jauregui but lost it in his first defense with a TKO defeat by Jose Luis Castillo. Diaz reclaimed the belt with a knockout win against Jesus Chavez in 2007 but again ceded it on his first defense against Juan Diaz.

The 29-year-old won two subsequent fights but had now lost his past two.
