bristol palin has been hired to be the poster child for teen abstinence for $262K

really? really.

"Teen mom Bristol Palin, now 20, scored $262,000 in 2009 as Candies Foundation ambassador promoting abstinence.

Let me get this straight: Candies paid a teen mom a quarter-million dollars to tell other teens not to become teen moms?

According to the Candies Web site, Palins job  which she still has  is helping other teens understand the incredible challenges teen parents face, and encouraging them to wait until they are socially and financially independent to start their families.

What incredible challenges? Like walking the red carpet and mastering the paso doble on Dancing with the Stars?"

In the minds of the marketers it's all about celebrity.
How that celebrity status is achieved doesn't matter.
 
 
I agree. WTF??
 
 
Who better than a young woman who's 'been there, done that and got the t-shirt'? If her last name wasn't Palin, this wouldn't be an issue.

That's right, the last name of Hilton would be just as good.

maybe someone with ties to reality rather than ties to reality tv.

if her last name wasn't palin, they wouldn't be paying her $262 let alone $262K.

Snookie and the Situation get $10,000 for walking into a bar. Nuff said?
 
 
Shouldnt someone that HAS practiced abstinence be the spokesperson for such a thing?
I do admit I cant stand anything Palin, so my opinion is biased and unfair...yes, I do admit that. But still....it seems awfully strange to me they would choose her. A more stable role model would have been better. JMHO.

Actually, I'd prefer a spokeperson have some first hand experience of what they are talking about. What better person to talk about why other kids shouldn't do what she did? I don't really care what her last name is, only the impact she can have on other kids.
 
 
Omg. I really am a prude.

No, but I would venture to guess that Palin at least worked.

It's not an abstinence only campaign. And yes, I think a teen mom is a better spokesperson, just like a former addict can bring better perspective to drug prevention programs.

 
The overarching message of our campaigns is  Pause Before You Play : pause to think about your future; pause to think about consequences; pause to evaluate your relationship; pause to delay sex; pause to get a condom; pause to ask why now?

Specific messages of our campaigns have included:

 I Never Thought I Would Be a Statistic
 Not Really the Way You Pictured Your First Crib
 Not What You Had in Mind for Your First Set of Wheels
 You Think Being in School Sucks?
 And you thought your parents were controlling?
 Be Sexy: It Doesnt Mean You Have to Have Sex
 Be Smart: Dont Give Up Your Education
 Be Smart: You Are Too Young to Start

 

 the candie's foundation 

It's an excellent message.

How sad that you cannot differentiate between mother and child. I have no problem with Bristol taking advantage of the opportunities opened to her by her last name. I have no issue with her trying to do some good from using her past mistakes to show other kids that it's not a smart move. None.

Since I haven't paid much attention to any Palin, I don't really care one way or the other but kids are more likely to listen to a 'reality tv star' than their parents, teachers, or politicians. Fact.
 
 
I admitted I was biased. I wont lie and say Im not. Dont know if its sad though. Isnt to me.

It's sad that you see a name over a person. I can't say I'm overly impressed with Bristol Palin, but to dislike her based on her mother's political opinions is sad. Bristol has her own mind (or lack thereof if she takes after her mother), but is entitled to be judged as her own person.

Personally, I have little time of any 'celeb' of any calibre. Just because you are a good actor, singer, or whatever does not make you a smart person who I should pay attention to but sadly, young people are impressed by 'fame'... and it does not appear to matter how that 'fame' was achieved. But famous, she is. And fame counts. I would prefer she use that 'fame' for good and encouraging kids not to have kids is a good thing.
 
 
Well said CG. I am hardly a fan of our national obsession with celebrities but I'd rather see someone paid 300K to do good, than to see the members of the "Bad Girlls Club" get paid to beat the shit out of each other in the underwear. Or Kardashian sisters give each other bikini waxes. Maybe its just me...
 
 
 
I admitted I was biased. I wont lie and say Im not. Dont know if its sad though. Isnt to me.

 

So, just because my father was a piece of shit, I must be, too.

Yup, that makes perfect sense.  
 
 
TV must DIE.

Who better than a young woman who's 'been there, done that and got the t-shirt'? If her last name wasn't Palin, this wouldn't be an issue.

 

As much as I couldn't really care less what some publicist is prepared to lavish upon yet another in a string of increasingly asinine 'faces' to promote a vehicle that's only been commissioned to generate sympathy and subsequent advertising revenue, Bristol Palin's comfortable circumstances hardly fit the context of the message she's supposed to be delivering, now, does it?

I mean, unlike the part of society this campaign is supposedly meant to focus on, she's hardly scratching together a living and eating a bowl of rope soup under a bridge every night.

But her name is Palin, and that is the issue. I wonder (if you were honest) how you might react if a twenty year old black gangster known as a shooter was offered a similar gig by ACORN?
Oh, btw, did anyone notice who the Gov. of Wisconsin hired? And, more importantly the CV's of two he passed over for the son of a contributor whose CV includes dropping out of college and two DUI's?

Then you decide watching a horror movie is a better option for your serenity.

I would have absolutely no problem with any kid trying to set an alternative example, based on their person experience. I don't really understand why this is now a 'race' issue.... with the use of a 'twenty year old black gangster'.... Shame that you're so desperate to make this something more than it is.

You missed the "if you were honest" part. Frankly, your many posts suggest you've adopted moral relativism into your conservative ideology. I also pointed out another example, that of the New Right's darling Gov. Walker. Of course that behavior skipped past your radar.

 Non-Profit Pays Bristol Palin $262,500, Donates Only $35,000 to Charity - E.D. Kain - American Times - Forbes 

Bristol Palin has made her first few hundred thousand working to prevent teenage pregnancy. Unfortunately for teen moms, however, Ms. Palin decided to keep most of her non-profit’s funds for herself:

In 2009, Sarah Palin’s daughter Bristol joined a teen pregnancy prevention nonprofit called the Candie’s Foundation. Today, the Associated Press reported that the Candie’s Foundation released its 2009 tax information, revealing that Bristol was paid a salary of $262,500.

But a closer examination of the tax form by ThinkProgress shows that the group disbursed only $35,000 in grants to actual teen pregnancy health and counseling clinics: $25,000 to the Mt. Sinai Adolescent Health Center and $10,000 to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.

I knew there was a lot of money to be made in the non-profit industry, but I didn’t know anyone would so blatantly abuse their position at a supposed charity. For every dollar Bristol gave to the cause, she gave $7.50 to herself.

Her charity, the Candie’s Foundation, also spent $165,000 on advertising. That’s another $4.71 for every dollar given to charity.

Only a Palin could make so much money over getting banged up

Any time free market capitalism pisses off a lib is a good thing.
 
 
Why is it "unfortunate" that a person decides to keep most their money?  
 
 
13% of the gross income is quite a chunk of pay to give to charity.

But hey....Another day, another Palin thread.  
 
 
RW, if you were a celebrity, you know damn well that you'd milk it for all it's worth. You'd milk the money udder dry until even your tits were sore!!!
 
 
The Palin name never ceases to attract the rabid leftwingnuts...
 
 
Considering the taxes on that amount of money, the amount giving to charity is a pretty good percentage.

Personally, I think if a single mother can store some money away for a rainy day, more power to her. She has enough problems due to her choices, why complicate them more?

Perhaps I'm not understanding.

Bristol Palin had or has a non-profit organization that was supposed to be working towards a goal.
She took the vast majority of the money and gave the non-profit a pittance.

What kind of free-market bullshit is supposed to save her ass?

Think about this...Let's say you start a non-profit cancer charity in your own town. The idea is to raise money to donate to fund anti-cancer research. Let's say you get 200,000$ raised in a year and you only give 13k to the actual anti-cancer research...are you people REALLY SAYING that that's ok?

That amounts to "ha ha!! Bitch made her money! Who cares who she screwed to make it as long as it's legal! She sure fooled a bunch of people, but screw them."

Honestly...I don't really care about the Palins. I just think what happened was fucked up.

She's drawing a salary from the charity, to which she...y'know.... gives back an amount which exceeds that which is expropriated from her by FICA.

But her name is "Palin", so nothing short of her living in an igloo and eating penguin poop sandwiches will make fruitcakes like you happy.

as Oddball noted..35K? you're really warped dude, seriously. Jesus, ask your owner to buy you another chew toy....FFS..  

How much did you give to charity last year? % please.
 
 
I bet the Palin lovers contributed a majority of the total contributions to the charity and I'm sure they have no problem with Bristol keeping $262,000 while $35,000 went to the actual intended recipients. It's a win-win!
 
 
So what was the money? was she suppose to be paid, or did she keep donations?
I still don't like the girl though. Felt bad for her at one time, now after seeing some of the stuff she has pulled, I think she is spoiled little brat and should go away. Giving a teacher a dirty look for being a teacher, when your grandfather is a teacher, is just trash in my book.
 
 
~20% is not most. $260k for a celebrity spokesperson for a year long campaign is pretty cheap.

People have gone to prison for less

 

Actually, the charity pulled in over $1.2 million, paid Palin her salary and disbursed $35k.

 http://http://blogs.forbes.com/elisadoucette/2011/04/06/bristol-palins-compensation-seven-times-candies-foundation-donations-to-charities/ 

 

Damn...That is even worse

Never knew rightwing charities were so lucrative
 
 
 
I bet the Palin lovers contributed a majority of the total contributions to the charity and I'm sure they have no problem with Bristol keeping $262,000 while $35,000 went to the actual intended recipients. It's a win-win!

 

It's $35K more than the charity had before hiring Palin. Yup...win/win.

I'd take it.
 
 
Do any of you defenders of these actions like to have your donations pocketed by the opperators of the charity?

Is that where you want your donation dollars going?

This sounds like a sham organization.
 
 
 
 Non-Profit Pays Bristol Palin $262,500, Donates Only $35,000 to Charity - E.D. Kain - American Times - Forbes 

Bristol Palin has made her first few hundred thousand working to prevent teenage pregnancy. Unfortunately for teen moms, however, Ms. Palin decided to keep most of her non-profit’s funds for herself:

In 2009, Sarah Palin’s daughter Bristol joined a teen pregnancy prevention nonprofit called the Candie’s Foundation. Today, the Associated Press reported that the Candie’s Foundation released its 2009 tax information, revealing that Bristol was paid a salary of $262,500.

But a closer examination of the tax form by ThinkProgress shows that the group disbursed only $35,000 in grants to actual teen pregnancy health and counseling clinics: $25,000 to the Mt. Sinai Adolescent Health Center and $10,000 to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.

I knew there was a lot of money to be made in the non-profit industry, but I didn’t know anyone would so blatantly abuse their position at a supposed charity. For every dollar Bristol gave to the cause, she gave $7.50 to herself.

Her charity, the Candie’s Foundation, also spent $165,000 on advertising. That’s another $4.71 for every dollar given to charity.

Only a Palin could make so much money over getting banged up

 

if this was a liberal or democrat I would be appalled and outraged and use it as more evidence of what lying scumbags ALL liberals and democrats are

but

since it's a tea party conservative christian republican I say;

typical of left wing liberal morons trying to make an issue over this

this is a non-issue, folks....nothing to see here...

remember....when a dem does it...it's REALLY BAD

but when a conservative republican does it...DEMS are REALLY BAD

Gotta link so that you can refresh my memory?
 
 
The right in this country just disappoints morally at every turn anymore.
 
 
 
 
 
Your intense interest in Bristol Palin is creepy....

 

Perhaps rightwhiner prefers kids to have abortions than be informed about abstinence?

 

yea...especially when you keep most of the money that was supposed to go to "the cause"

 

She stole the money from the Charity? Gee, I thought they paid her to work for them. Sounds like a reasonable arrangement to me. But then, I'm a conservative.
 
 
If nothing else this is a PRIME example of why you can not leave everything to charity to do.

This sounds like a sham organization.

 

I really don't know if they are a sham organization or not, but if getting paid by a charitable organization makes it a sham organization, then I suppose you need to start bitching about The United Way, too.
 
 
It is better than nothing, and many charities do the same thing. But it does says a lot about her.
I think maybe she shouldn't have taken such a high salary.

what does it say about her?

 

Not much other than she sees that she can help a charity, and make a living to provide for her child. What an outrageous thing to do.

What it says about some people on this forum is that they are not terribly intelligent, in my opinion. Charities are quite good at finding suitable spokespeople, and pay them what they think that person's value is to their work (and they're quite experienced in working out 'value added'). No one forced the Charity to pay Bristol. Basic facts elude the mentally challenged.
 
 
btw, I have seen the commercial, its actually pretty darn good.

bristol palin has been hired to be the poster child for teen abstinence for $262K

really? really.

"Teen mom Bristol Palin, now 20, scored $262,000 in 2009 as Candies Foundation ambassador promoting abstinence.

Let me get this straight: Candies paid a teen mom a quarter-million dollars to tell other teens not to become teen moms?

According to the Candies Web site, Palins job  which she still has  is helping other teens understand the incredible challenges teen parents face, and encouraging them to wait until they are socially and financially independent to start their families.

What incredible challenges? Like walking the red carpet and mastering the paso doble on Dancing with the Stars?"

 Teen mom Bristol Palin&rsquo;s hefty check gives birth to outrage - BostonHerald.com 

cut the shit

 

A friend of mine has a daughter who got pregnant at 16. She speaks to teens at schools and churches about the mistakes she made. Not only do parents welcome what she has to say, but from what I understand she has had a major impact on the lives of the teens she has spoken to. She's in her mid-20s now.
 
 
Do you people give to charities that supply vastly more money to their front people than the people who need help?
 
 
That's a lot just for having a famous mom.

But really, it's not like she's sharing a rundown studio with her boyfriend and between then two of them they barley makes enough for each other, let alone their baby, and neither of them have enough for daycare so her mom ends up actually raising the kid while the two of them work dead-end jobs for shit pay, only to have it leave their hands in favor of diapers, baby food, doctor checkups, and, if they're lucky after all the bills and sparse groceries are paid for the month, enough spare change to go out to Applebees one night, and that's the only time they actually have for each other.

You think she's gone through any of that? Doubtful. And yet she's giving lectures about the repercussions of teen pregnancy.
 
 
 
 
 
This is how the right would have charity done.

Obviously the answer is overhead

The government does not pay anyone $262,000 a year....let alone a 20 year old without an education

piss off
 
 
So the right wants charity private yet has no problem that most of the money goes to pay salary instead of helping people?

How do you think the poor would ever get helped with this type of plan?
 
 
Now if she'd gone to college for 4 years, medical school for 4 years, and family practice residency for three years, she'd be able to make half that...but still have college loans equal to $262K!
 
 
As an aside, for those who are bitching about how the candie's foundation spends it's money.... this should explain it... unless you're really dumb.

 the candie's foundation 

The Candie’s Foundation is a non-profit organization that works to shape the way youth in America think about teen pregnancy and parenthood. We are an operating foundation rather than a grant-making foundation. The foundation develops and runs communication campaigns to raise awareness about, and motivate teens to prevent, teen pregnancy.

Each year, millions of teens are exposed to the foundation's messages, which encourage them to delay pregnancy and expose them to the realities of teen parenthood. Our approach is unique: all of our ads use celebrities that teens can relate to, in a style that speaks to teens on their own terms. We go beyond raising awareness; our goal is to influence teen culture.

A key to the success of our campaigns is sharing our content with organizations around the country that are doing community-level teen pregnancy prevention programs. This way we reach teens simultaneously at the macro level – pop culture around teen pregnancy and parenting – and the micro level – individual skills and behaviors.

That answers 'truthdon'tmatter's' dumbassed question about how those donating to the charity would feel. One would assume that if one is donating to a charity, one would find out how that charity undertakes its work - at least that's what I do before I write a check. The charity states they are a campaigning organization. The commercial is part of that campaign. I see no issue with it... other than idiot lefties who hate the name Palin more than they care about underage pregnancy.

what did she do with the quarter mill?

 

I know she gets paid, but I'm not sure how much. She's been speaking for several years. I would assume she uses the money to pay bills and raise her child. I guess I don't understand the outrage. $262,000 is a lot of money, but Bristol has celebrity status and therefore people will likely be more interested in what she has to say. (That's just the way it is.)

It's true that even a SES doesn't pull in $262K. But, I do find it quaint that you actually believe that only one government worker would be needed by the government to provide this service.

That's some pretty adorable naivete.
 
 
so there's no one else who would be willing to do this for less than $262k?

there's no better use for that money?

According to the Candies Web site, Palins job  which she still has  is helping other teens understand the incredible challenges teen parents face, and encouraging them to wait until they are socially and financially independent to start their families.

What incredible challenges? Like walking the red carpet and mastering the paso doble on Dancing with the Stars?"

The Simon says method of teaching doesn't work. You must lead by example. What a waste of money.
 
 
 
 
so there's no one else who would be willing to do this for less than $262k?

there's no better use for that money?

otay

 

I don't know. Is there another with current celeb status who has personal experience in this matter and who could get so much attention?

Just judging by this thread alone, it seems as if the charity chose well. I never even heard of the charity until this, so it raised my awareness of at least its existence.

 

do you think it was worth $262K?
actually more than that. i doubt bristol paid for the shoot.
 
 
 
 
As an aside, for those who are bitching about how the candie's foundation spends it's money.... this should explain it... unless you're really dumb.

 the candie's foundation 

The Candies Foundation is a non-profit organization that works to shape the way youth in America think about teen pregnancy and parenthood. We are an operating foundation rather than a grant-making foundation. The foundation develops and runs communication campaigns to raise awareness about, and motivate teens to prevent, teen pregnancy.

Each year, millions of teens are exposed to the foundation's messages, which encourage them to delay pregnancy and expose them to the realities of teen parenthood. Our approach is unique: all of our ads use celebrities that teens can relate to, in a style that speaks to teens on their own terms. We go beyond raising awareness; our goal is to influence teen culture.

A key to the success of our campaigns is sharing our content with organizations around the country that are doing community-level teen pregnancy prevention programs. This way we reach teens simultaneously at the macro level  pop culture around teen pregnancy and parenting  and the micro level  individual skills and behaviors.

That answers 'truthdon'tmatter's' dumbassed question about how those donating to the charity would feel. One would assume that if one is donating to a charity, one would find out how that charity undertakes its work - at least that's what I do before I write a check. The charity states they are a campaigning organization. The commercial is part of that campaign. I see no issue with it... other than idiot lefties who hate the name Palin more than they care about underage pregnancy.

 

Gee that is great, they film Palin saying stuff and then get to pocket big salaries for it.

Im sure that really helps the kids

 

It seems to me that you know very little about charities. So, here's a little lesson for you. I'll try and keep it simple so you can cope with the information contained herein.

There are various types of charities. Some are 'ground based', meaning that they directly work with their target community.

Others are 'campaigning' charities. These work at a different level, seeking to change behavior of their target community through awareness raising campaigns - such as the candie's foundation.

Others work by 'lobbying'. These work to establish links with Government agencies, political parties, etc who try to influence policy to help their target community.

All serve a useful purpose.... at least they do if you're smart enough to understand and differentiate between the various types of charity.

Idiot.

I'm not in that business, so I don't know what the going rates are. If I knew what they were, like we can see for labor, etc., I would have a good answer for you.

I can say that I wouldn't mind that compensation for a video shoot, though, if my face were already out there.

Did you see her ad spot? I think you should watch it, its actually pretty good. Not 250k good but its good.

 YouTube - Candies Foundation Bristol Palin PSA 
  YouTube - Candies Foundation Bristol Palin PSA 

 

whether or not the ad is good is irrelevant, imo.

 

Its completely relevant. Your upset that they paid Bristol Palin to do something because of her personal life situation and status and this is what they paid her to do.

If you watch the ad it kinda makes your being upset about it seem trivial and a little petty in light of how they used her in this ad.

Well, since pretty much every corporation uses 'advertising' to promote its products or services, yea... it does work.

Research from around the world suggests that young people particularly are more likely to listen to their peers than their parents, teachers or authority figures... hence, political parties love celebrity endorsements.

It's advertising to raise awareness of the realities of underage, unplanned pregnancy. It's a pity you are so blinded by partisan hatred that you can't see basic facts.

What's the difference between paying the government employees' salaries and the salaries of charity employees? The money is still green. However, I would bet good money that the smaller organization uses that money (and personnel) more efficiently. Just a guess.

 

Obviously the answer is overhead

The government does not pay anyone $262,000 a year....let alone a 20 year old without an education

 

It's true that even a SES doesn't pull in $262K. But, I do find it quaint that you actually believe that only one government worker would be needed by the government to provide this service.

That's some pretty adorable naivete.

 

Want to pull down the other salaries that Candies foundation paid and compare them to Government salaries?

I think you are adorable too
 
 
I wonder if she negotiated the payment, or if maybe the family has an agent/handler who does all that?

She'd get brownies points if she gave most of that money back to the charity to use on further awareness efforts. That would say a good thing about her character, imo.

Watched a talk show a few years ago. A bunch of pregnant teens and their moms, who had had them as teenagers. The moms wanted their kids to abort or give the child up for adoption, the teens all said to their mothers "You did it, why can't I?".

Again, the Simon says method of teaching has NEVER worked. You lead by example.

How do you feel about Christians who tell people how to live but go out and do what they please? How do you feel about those who keep their mouths shut but take care of their families and live according to their beliefs?

Think about it.

But I have more respect for those that do it for free and only accept payment to cover expenses.

 

From a personal perspective, I agree.... IF they can actually afford it. Since Bristol is not necessarily a celebrity who has made enough money to last her a lifetime and then some, I have no issue with her accepting payment for it.

I think we need to apply some critical thought - and factor in what we don't know - before making a judgement on it.

For instance, truthdon'tmatter has her panties in a wad because the charity should, according to her, be using that money to work directly with young females. But that is not the core purpose of the charity so that's a ridiculous argument.

I have to say, frankly, I can't think of anyone better than Bristol Palin to undertake this particular role... having watched the ad... I think she was a perfect choice. I'll even consider donating to the charity - having read up on their work. I think they do great work.

Bully for them. Frankly, Bristol Palin is not 'bowling for cancer', she's trying to earn a living to support her child. Want to hang her for that? I wouldn't. She's trying to do both - by working for a salary - for a charity that she obviously thinks is important. Why the fuck that is so over the intellectual paygrade of some people is, frankly, beyond my intellectual paygrade.

But I do know there are still some who think the federal government is actually efficient. And, it IS cute.
 
 
 
 
 
It is better than nothing, and many charities do the same thing. But it does says a lot about her.
I think maybe she shouldn't have taken such a high salary.

 

what does it say about her?

 

Not much other than she sees that she can help a charity, and make a living to provide for her child. What an outrageous thing to do.

What it says about some people on this forum is that they are not terribly intelligent, in my opinion. Charities are quite good at finding suitable spokespeople, and pay them what they think that person's value is to their work (and they're quite experienced in working out 'value added'). No one forced the Charity to pay Bristol. Basic facts elude the mentally challenged.

 

I personally would like the charity that I donate to spend most of the money on the cause they are raising the money for. But I guess that is me. If that makes me mentally challenged, so be it.

But I do love where you are going. It seems your insults lately, have either been about the mentally challenged or people who smoke pot. What did the mentally challenged or marijuana ever do to you? or do you just need to get laid???

Kids and parents. A natural battleground. That's why I said that the Palin ad is a good thing. She's their age.... she's been there, done that and got the t-shirt... and, frankly, if she feels inclined to try to stop some kids making the same mistake.... I say 'good for her'.

If you were smart enough to read up on the foundation, (and I did spoon feed the board earlier in the thread) you would have worked out that this is exactly what they raise money for. They are a campaigning charity (I have also spoon fed the board as to the difference between various types of charity). Therefore, I suggest you maybe need to smoke less weed and let your intellect recover.

And.... mind your own fucking business about my life, stoner.

Some boys decide that they should devote all their time and effort to playing ball so that they can go pro (foregoing studying, for example). For most, that is a bad choice as few make it.

I have no problem with the ad, she can do whatever she wants. I don't even really care that much she made so much, while they charity donated even less to help the cause. I don't think charity work should make you rich.
I do have a problem with Bristol being in the lime light still, and personally would not want my daughter listening to her for advice or using her as a role model. She is a brat, and has proven she is immature. I felt bad for her in the beginning, but the moment she disrespected that teacher, I stopped feeling bad for her.

I personally would like the charity that I donate to spend most of the money on the cause they are raising the money for. But I guess that is me. If that makes me mentally challenged, so be it.

But I do love where you are going. It seems your insults lately, have either been about the mentally challenged or people who smoke pot. What did the mentally challenged or marijuana ever do to you? or do you just need to get laid???

 

If you were smart enough to read up on the foundation, (and I did spoon feed the board earlier in the thread) you would have worked out that this is exactly what they raise money for. They are a campaigning charity (I have also spoon fed the board as to the difference between various types of charity). Therefore, I suggest you maybe need to smoke less weed and let your intellect recover.

And.... mind your own fucking business about my life, stoner.

 

And? So, because that is what they do, I can't have a problem with it?

And I do love how you tell me to stay out of your business while commenting on me smoking weed. I think maybe someone should look in the mirror.
 
 
 
 
 
It's true that even a SES doesn't pull in $262K. But, I do find it quaint that you actually believe that only one government worker would be needed by the government to provide this service.

That's some pretty adorable naivete.

 

Want to pull down the other salaries that Candies foundation paid and compare them to Government salaries?

I think you are adorable too

 

Sure. I would have no issue taking on that challenge. Based on my experience in federal government 'efficiency', I have a strong suspicion what the results of that challenge would be.

But I do know there are still some who think the federal government is actually efficient. And, it IS cute.

 

Charity takes in $1.2 million and disburses $35 K??

Yea....I'll take the government on that one. Hell, I'd even take Planned Parenthood if the Republicans hadn't pulled their funding

They aren't a 'disbursing' charity. Read up on their work... I've provided a link and their objectives.... how stupid are you? They spend their funds on campaigning. That costs money. They 'disburse' whatever is left over.
 
 
 
 
 
That she is a greedy little spoiled brat. But I thought that about her before I read this article.

 

Do you have a problem with the actual ad spot or just with Bristol being ok with having a charity pay her 250k to do it?

What is your issue here?

 

I have no problem with the ad, she can do whatever she wants. I don't even really care that much she made so much, while they charity donated even less to help the cause. I don't think charity work should make you rich.
I do have a problem with Bristol being in the lime light still, and personally would not want my daughter listening to her for advice or using her as a role model. She is a brat, and has proven she is immature. I felt bad for her in the beginning, but the moment she disrespected that teacher, I stopped feeling bad for her.

 

Thanks.

Now I know your issue is with the young woman's behavior personally and not with what she was doing in relation to the topic of this thread.

Funny, if one looks at the  United Ways' financial report , they pulled in ~$102 mill and had expenses of ~$94 mill last year. 89% of their expenses were spent on program while the remaining were spent on admin and fund raising. Sounds pretty good, for someone who would say what you just said: that you want most of the money going toward the programs that the charity runs/supports. Funny thing is, the United Way considers program expenses as public relations, campaigning, and community impact and learning leadership, for example.

What do you think of the United Way now?

I wonder if she negotiated the payment, or if maybe the family has an agent/handler who does all that?

She'd get brownies points if she gave most of that money back to the charity to use on further awareness efforts. That would say a good thing about her character, imo.

 

We have "Bowl a Strike for Cancer" every year. There's a team that wins almost every year and they always give their cash prize back to our charity.

 

Bully for them. Frankly, Bristol Palin is not 'bowling for cancer', she's trying to earn a living to support her child. Want to hang her for that? I wouldn't. She's trying to do both - by working for a salary - for a charity that she obviously thinks is important. Why the fuck that is so over the intellectual paygrade of some people is, frankly, beyond my intellectual paygrade.

 

I do not blame here for wanting to make money to support herself and her child. I blame the charity for hiring her to influence unwed teenage girls not to have babies when she so obviously did it herself.

You can call me stupid, and cuss at me all you want, it won't change the fact that the Simon says method of teaching has never worked. It's a waste of money.

bristol palin has been hired to be the poster child for teen abstinence for $262K

really? really.

"Teen mom Bristol Palin, now 20, scored $262,000 in 2009 as Candies Foundation ambassador promoting abstinence.

Let me get this straight: Candies paid a teen mom a quarter-million dollars to tell other teens not to become teen moms?

According to the Candies Web site, Palins job  which she still has  is helping other teens understand the incredible challenges teen parents face, and encouraging them to wait until they are socially and financially independent to start their families.

What incredible challenges? Like walking the red carpet and mastering the paso doble on Dancing with the Stars?"

With that said, someone said something about such outlandish payment for someone to be spokesperson..that money should be spent on the organization itself...not in some already-weathly pocket, dontcha think?
 
 
looks like being stupid and spreading her legs for that winner levi was the best thing she ever did for herself.

too bad that isn't the way of the real world.

This advertising is what this particular charity spends its money on. And is Bristol Palin wealthy? I know her parents might be. Frankly, so are mine. But I still have to earn my own living. So should she. Everyone should earn their own money... at least, that's what conservatives believe.  
 
 
Love the headline on Sky News:

Teen Sex Charity Pays Bristol Palin $300k
 
 
 
 
 
I can only watch it without the sound, what's she saying? If she made 262,000 in 2009 why is she living in a one-room nearly vacant apartment?

Shes living at home with her parents and making money just by being a Palin.
I would have more tolerance of her if she would have denied such a huge sum and said she will take payment, yes, but donate most of the rest to the cause she agreed to be spokesperson for.
Then again..as I stated before...thats just what Id do. And humans tend to judge the actions of others on their own tickled ears.
 
 
She has the character to stand up and admit she made a mistake, what a novel idea....

Obviously she negotiated a nice fee for it, more power to her....

The green eyed monster lives, lives very well indeed....
 
 
 
 
 
Calling people a retard to be negative is the same as calling someone a faggot to be negative, its offensive.

Its your right to be crude, rude, and offensive but I wouldn't encorage it.

 

Palin doesn't find use of the word "nigger" to be offensive...as long as Dr. Laura says it.
 
Dr.Laura:dont retreatreload! (Steps aside bc her 1st Amend.rights ceased 2exist thx 2activists trying 2silenceisnt American,not fair)
Dr.Laura=even more powerful & effective w/out the shackles, so watch out Constitutional obstructionists. And b thankful 4 her voice,America!

 

 

As it was used, with the context of its use, no it was not offensive.

 Dr. Laura Schlesingers Nigger Rant (Transcript) « Emptysuit 

^^^^ That's the whole conversation. Dr Laura was not calling anyone the 'n' word, she was using it in an entirely different context.

Context... it's your friend.

 

So, because she didn't call someone a nigger, then it could not possibly have offended anyone, right?

That's fucking retarded!

I fail to see how her living arrangements are an issue. Whether she's living with them or not, she needs to earn a living to support her child.

I don't see why she should be expected to donate any - but she has donated part of it. I don't see why we should hold her to a different standard to the rest of us, just because she happens to have the last name Palin. I wish I could understand it, I just can't see what she did wrong.

bristol palin has been hired to be the poster child for teen abstinence for $262K

really? really.

"Teen mom Bristol Palin, now 20, scored $262,000 in 2009 as Candies Foundation ambassador promoting abstinence.

Let me get this straight: Candies paid a teen mom a quarter-million dollars to tell other teens not to become teen moms?

According to the Candies Web site, Palins job  which she still has  is helping other teens understand the incredible challenges teen parents face, and encouraging them to wait until they are socially and financially independent to start their families.

What incredible challenges? Like walking the red carpet and mastering the paso doble on Dancing with the Stars?"

I've been telling you this for a long time. The nastier the liberals treat someone the richer that someone gets. Keep it up.
 
 
Didn't Lyle Alzado make a public service spot about steroid use? Of course, I bet that didn't have any impact on kids and young adults who are at risk for steroid use at all. Nope, no impact. I mean, here it is 20 years later and I would bet that many know this.

Touche.

Lyle Alzado made PSAs about the horrors of steroid use, just like Bristol made a commercial about the horrors of teenage pregnancy.

I think it is important that we teach girls about this, because we dont want them punished with a baby.

The quality of logic of politicians welcoming celeb endorsements because they know they influence a specific target audience?

This charity is in the business of awareness, and I am now aware of them. Not bad for someone who rarely watches the tube.

Some boys decide that they should devote all their time and effort to playing ball so that they can go pro (foregoing studying, for example). For most, that is a bad choice as few make it. For most girls, hoping that they could also get this spot and foregoing other avenues of success (studying, for example) would be a poor choice.

Not everyone can be helped. One tries to help the most that they can.

 

Maybe we should get together and found a charity to 'fix stupid'?  

 

charity begins at home.

 
 
 
 
 
I am, frankly, dumbfounded that anyone has an issue with it.

The drunks and druggies are the same logic. Celebrity endorsements of politicians has nothing in common. Consider the celebrity is not a politician but a private citizen.

If an athlete like Barry Bonds endorsed abstinence from the use of human growth steroids, then we would have the Palin dynamic. If an athlete was selling shoes or jock itch cream or athlete's foot treatments, I could see no problem with it.

But ya can't hold yer baby on yer hip, text yer BFF and tell teenage girls not to climb into the back seat until they're married and still call yourself credible.

which I think is good stuff!

but we all know what cons would be saying if this was chelsea clinton or one of the obama girls (or any democrat). They'd be denouncing her as a pig, slut, whore, immoral....

and mocking and ridiculing her and the charity

and OUTRAGED that so much donated money was going to her at the expense of the charity itself

 

yes, yes i am.
 
 
 
 
 
Bully for them. Frankly, Bristol Palin is not 'bowling for cancer', she's trying to earn a living to support her child. Want to hang her for that? I wouldn't. She's trying to do both - by working for a salary - for a charity that she obviously thinks is important. Why the fuck that is so over the intellectual paygrade of some people is, frankly, beyond my intellectual paygrade.

 

I do not blame here for wanting to make money to support herself and her child. I blame the charity for hiring her to influence unwed teenage girls not to have babies when she so obviously did it herself.

You can call me stupid, and cuss at me all you want, it won't change the fact that the Simon says method of teaching has never worked. It's a waste of money.

 

Yup, that's why AA, NA, and other programs like that are so awful and useless because all they all are drunks, addicts, etc. who talk to others who want to stop.

Nope, there's absolutely NO benefit from personal examples of what could happen to you if you don't think before behaving in a certain way.

Because if one is trying to teach others due to it being the right thing to do, one shouldnt accept such an obscene amount of money if they truly want to help.
You wouldnt keep money you found, CG. Which means youre a standup kinda gal. Would you accept that kind of money even though you already HAVE that kind of money and want for nothing?
My problem with the vid, although done quite well, is she didnt use the IF word strongly enough. There are so many young girls getting pregnant that dont even HAVE an apartment, much less an unfurnished one.
Bristol is just a really bad choice. May as well put Michael Vick as spokesperson for the ASPCA or Peta.

According to the Candies Web site, Palins job  which she still has  is helping other teens understand the incredible challenges teen parents face, and encouraging them to wait until they are socially and financially independent to start their families.

What incredible challenges? Like walking the red carpet and mastering the paso doble on Dancing with the Stars?"

which I think is good stuff!

but we all know what cons would be saying if this was chelsea clinton or one of the obama girls (or any democrat). They'd be denouncing her as a pig, slut, whore, immoral....

and mocking and ridiculing her and the charity

and OUTRAGED that so much donated money was going to her at the expense of the charity itself

 

yes, yes i am.

 

You're outraged that a charity spends money donated by those who recognize that campaigning is an important way to influence young people? This charity, the candie's foundation, are a campaigning organization. You are aware of that, are you not? You know that they raise money specifically to spend on awareness raising campaigns, and that includes paying people they deem are influential to their target audience, right?

What is there to be outraged about? They raised the funds for awareness raising campaigning and that is exactly what Bristol's ad is.

Somebody please explain logically to me exactly what there is to be outraged about.
 
 
 
 
Didn't Lyle Alzado make a public service spot about steroid use? Of course, I bet that didn't have any impact on kids and young adults who are at risk for steroid use at all. Nope, no impact. I mean, here it is 20 years later and I would bet that many know this.

 

how much was he paid?

 

Id like to know that as well.
 
 
 
 
 
Is it any diffferent than when an ex-junkie talks to kids about staying away from drugs?

You Palin haters are hilarious.

 

you let me know when you find an ex-junkie getting $262k to do it, and then we'll talk, otay?

 

So it's the amount of money she was paid that pisses you off.

That's even more hilarious.

 

yeah, it's a real kneeslapper.

you thinking i'm pissed off is even funnier.
 
 
 
 
 
Its completely relevant. Your upset that they paid Bristol Palin to do something because of her personal life situation and status and this is what they paid her to do.

If you watch the ad it kinda makes your being upset about it seem trivial and a little petty in light of how they used her in this ad.

 

thanks for sharing.

 

Anytime.

I hope you know I wasn't trying to insult you using negative descriptors of your behavior. I was just trying to be honest.

 

no worries

It pisses me off to see how much people get paid to read some one elses speech for 20 minutes.
 
 
 
 
 
Shes living at home with her parents and making money just by being a Palin.
I would have more tolerance of her if she would have denied such a huge sum and said she will take payment, yes, but donate most of the rest to the cause she agreed to be spokesperson for.
Then again..as I stated before...thats just what Id do. And humans tend to judge the actions of others on their own tickled ears.

 

I fail to see how her living arrangements are an issue. Whether she's living with them or not, she needs to earn a living to support her child.

I don't see why she should be expected to donate any - but she has donated part of it. I don't see why we should hold her to a different standard to the rest of us, just because she happens to have the last name Palin. I wish I could understand it, I just can't see what she did wrong.

 

Because if one is trying to teach others due to it being the right thing to do, one shouldnt accept such an obscene amount of money if they truly want to help.
You wouldnt keep money you found, CG. Which means youre a standup kinda gal. Would you accept that kind of money even though you already HAVE that kind of money and want for nothing?
My problem with the vid, although done quite well, is she didnt use the IF word strongly enough. There are so many young girls getting pregnant that dont even HAVE an apartment, much less an unfurnished one.
Bristol is just a really bad choice. May as well put Michael Vick as spokesperson for the ASPCA or Peta.

 

If I was planning to dedicate my life to helping young girls to avoid the mistakes I made, and at the same time earn a living and bring up my child, and teach my child a work ethic, absolutely, yes I would take it.

Her parents are wealthy. So are mine. Am I supposed to not work for a living because I should be accepting handouts from my parents?     Try telling my Mom that one... she'd tell you that no child of hers is gonna take the easy road.

How about this: instead of hiring Bristol Palin for $262K, they could have hired 10 teenage moms from a variety of walks of life...people that other girls could associate with...and had them on a series of commericials showing their life and their hardships...and paid them each $26,200.

Yea, they could have. And they may do that in their future plans.... that's why they call it 'campaigning'.... it's not a one off ad. It's part of their overall strategy. How can you guys not see this? It's Public Relations 101.

So, in essence, your issue is that her parents are wealthy. Hmmm. That's pretty pathetic. Her parents have jack shit to do with it. She's a grown woman, trying to stand on her own two feet. How outrageous.

You know what would have been ideal?

if Bristol Palin, coming from a family that can afford to and has helped her with her teen pregnancy, did the whole thing free of charge.

Great message, too high a price tag.

EDIT: This is assuming her parents are helping her out financially.

So it's the amount that you're outraged over? It doesn't seem overly much for her commitment to me. But I am quite a rational person. They are a campaigning charity. This work is what they do. They have a budget and they spend that budget as they see fit. I have no issue with that. In fact, I think what they do is pretty damned good. I'll be watching to see how this campaign develops.... currently, I don't know whether this £262 is a one off for that ad or a contract for a series of ads. Do you? No. Should we wait and find that out before we get all outraged or shall we just have a cow about it before knowing ALL the facts?

Bully for them. Frankly, Bristol Palin is not 'bowling for cancer', she's trying to earn a living to support her child. Want to hang her for that? I wouldn't. She's trying to do both - by working for a salary - for a charity that she obviously thinks is important. Why the fuck that is so over the intellectual paygrade of some people is, frankly, beyond my intellectual paygrade.

 

I do not blame here for wanting to make money to support herself and her child. I blame the charity for hiring her to influence unwed teenage girls not to have babies when she so obviously did it herself.

You can call me stupid, and cuss at me all you want, it won't change the fact that the Simon says method of teaching has never worked. It's a waste of money.

 

International research suggests that you are wrong. That's why corporations spend billions on advertising. Because it works. And this is no different to advertising a product, it's informing kids in a way they relate to.

 

Do you mind showing me some of these "international studies" that show the Simon says method of teaching works????
 
 
 
 
 
yes, yes i am.

You know.....if Candies foundation was truly interested in helping, I think that what equates to most in that situation as a whole years income for 10 mothers in 10 different cities, working as consultants for a year, visiting schools in the area would be much more effective than giving all that money to just one person who isn't all that available for speaking engagements.

There is nothing wrong with it in general at all.

Unfortunately for Bristol the very same thing that makes her a good choice also puts her under a different level of scrutiny than your average young american mother.

Well, let's just assume - for arguments sake - that most young people are reasonably intelligent.

Now let's assume that these kids have seen celeb after celeb becoming a single parent.

Now let's assume that those celebs drag their kids out like an accessory, similar to a new purse, looking glamorous, with kid dressed in designer clothes, looking all adorable.

Now let's assume those kids reading that magazine thing that's how it is when you have a kid.

Now let's assume that some of those kids see that ad from Bristol Palin.

Now let's assume that one or two of them think 'oh shit, maybe that's not such a good idea'.

Now do you get WHY they took this approach? Because this charity uses academic research - like most campaigning charities do - to develop very specific, impactive campaigns for very specific audiences.
 
 
If I remember correctly, Candies donated roughly 35,000 in support of programs for teen mothers

However, they paid Bristol 262,000 for her speaking engagements. Shouldn't those figures have been reversed?

Pay Bristol 35,000 and donate 262,000 in support of programs for unwed mothers.

Chelsea Clinton has no name recognition with the target audience. The Obama kids are children... totally not appropriate.

And.... please can we get into the thought process that this is a campaign.... NOT a one off ad... it is part of a bigger campaign... go look at their website to see the rest of it and who's involved.

I don't think people are seeing the whole picture, y'all are just pissy because it's Bristol Palin. I find that very narrow minded.

Oh good... we're back to that one... again. Answer: the £35k was excess funding.... the Candies Foundation is not a 'ground based' charity, ie it does not work directly with teen moms. It is a campaigning charity.... ie, it focuses on prevention.... one of the ways it does that is through the use of celebrity messaging... hence the use of Bristol Palin.

This has already been explained.... twice. Idiot.

Yup, that's why AA, NA, and other programs like that are so awful and useless because all they all are drunks, addicts, etc. who talk to others who want to stop.

Nope, there's absolutely NO benefit from personal examples of what could happen to you if you don't think before behaving in a certain way.  

 

 

no one in those programs takes money for speaking.

He remembered correctly, he just ignored the actual context.... that Candie's are not a 'ground based' charity, they are a campaigning charity. So the $35k was excess funding. GayBiker struggles with basic shit like 'context'.
 
 
 
If nothing else this is a PRIME example of why you can not leave everything to charity to do.

 

So this is why you support government controlling your life?
 
 
 
 
bristol palin has been hired to be the poster child for teen abstinence for $262K

really? really.

"Teen mom Bristol Palin, now 20, scored $262,000 in 2009 as Candies Foundation ambassador promoting abstinence.

Let me get this straight: Candies paid a teen mom a quarter-million dollars to tell other teens not to become teen moms?

According to the Candies Web site, Palins job  which she still has  is helping other teens understand the incredible challenges teen parents face, and encouraging them to wait until they are socially and financially independent to start their families.

What incredible challenges? Like walking the red carpet and mastering the paso doble on Dancing with the Stars?"

 Teen mom Bristol Palin&rsquo;s hefty check gives birth to outrage - BostonHerald.com 

cut the shit

 

If anything, she makes being a teen mom look like a good way to make money.

There's a word for that.

 

That was my first thought.
 
 
 
Snookie and the Situation get $10,000 for walking into a bar. Nuff said?

 

Bristol is cute.

But Snooki is cuter.
 
 
 
The right in this country just disappoints morally at every turn anymore.

 

Hate to break it to you TM, but you aren't exactly the paragon of morality yourself.

I haven't yet wrapped my head around this 'Snookie' character. The first I heard of her is when a friend's girlfriend dressed as 'Snookie' for Halloween. I think she mentioned something about Jersey Shore or Jersey Housewives or some sort of reality show and I tuned out at that point.

I've wanted to stay ignorant of her, based on the pics, but I may just have to look at wiki for some basics.

Somebody save me from my curiosity, pa-leez.

Watching reality tv seriously affects your IQ. True story.
 
 
here's the thing about bristol -

she's never had to face reality. she had campaign aids to help her and unlimited resources to make it through. her pregnancy made her into her own star, and she subsequently made it on to talk shows, and dancing with the stars, and on the covers of magazines. and she's made a tidy sum of money off of getting knocked up.

she never had to work two jobs and try to find a babysitter. she hasn't had to sacrifice anything for her child - and she likely never will. how can she explain to anyone that getting pregnant at such a young age is a bad idea when all it's done for her is garner fame and fortune?

just by having the girl as a spokesperson they're sending the wrong message. she's rich and famous because she was stupid and spread her legs without protection. she's never suffered for that mistake, and she likely never will. she makes teenage pregnancy look glamorous and easy.

frankly, putting her on any kind of pedestal is disgusting.

Actually, the ad does quite the opposite. But you wouldn't get that because you haven't watched it. You'd rather remain ignorant and talk out of your ass. She quite clearly takes the glamor OUT of teen pregnancy... and she wasn't the one who made it 'glamorous', that was the media, and stupidly shallow celebs dragging their illegitimate offspring around like fashion accessories.

Again... you're an idiot if you comment before you find out the facts. You are clearly more concerned with her last name than the message... that's pretty fucking stupid.

You have some evidence to support your claim that Bristol Palin is 'rich'?

She made a mistake. She's using that mistake to teach other kids that it is not the glamorous life that they are currently being sold in much of the media that informs young people. How on earth is that a bad thing? I simply do not get it. And if Bristol chooses to make a living from using her experience to inform young people that being a teen mom is not a glamorous thing, what is wrong with that?

Seriously, if this was some other celebrity, you'd all be saying how great it was - that's if anyone even paid any attention to it. The issue is her last name. It is pure hyperbolic ranting because her Mom is Sarah Palin.

she made $262k in one year with no college education or training of any kind. she fucked her way to a quarter million annual salary. that's rich in my book.

i have a problem with glamorizing teenage pregnancy. i don't care what you say, that's what the ad does. she's making $262k a year. she can hire people to raise her kid. she hasn't had to sacrifice at all for her child - quite the opposite. i find it disgusting. for every bristol palin there are hundreds of girls that have to work two jobs depend on the kindness of family to get by. they have to make real sacrifices and real decisions. bristol has never and will never have to do that. pay one of those other girls a fraction of what they pay bristol and let them speak about 'it wouldn't be so pretty' from experience.

$262k isn't 'rich'. It's not like she's earning $262k per year.... it's a one off payment.

The whole point of her ad is to make the point that you're making.... that having a kid as a teen is really fucking hard.

Every 'point' you make has already been addressed at least once. Your pathetic faux outrage about a Palin is pathetic. If she was the daughter of a left wing hero, you'd be high fiving her for her courage and wisdom. It's petty and laughable.
 
 
IF other girls have no clue WHO bristol is...then the message is fine although it needs tweaking. Im betting many girls will not be able to "connect" themselves with her because shes white, has a nice apartment even though its empty, and doesnt look too destitute. I think the message would have gotten thru to those more at risk in doing what bristol did with her own mistake if it were not bristol or anyone that has semi celeb exposure. This is not even counting that the money paid to her COULD have gone to many organizations that help such girls. Thats a LOT of money just to be spokesperson.

This is just my opinion only. I dont expect anyone to agree with it. I speak for myself. (just for clarification).

Now, THAT is valid.   It is fine for Bristol to talk to young teens but what about the minority teens that don't relate to her? Now, that is something we don't know. Has the charity developed a campaign to raise awareness among those teens? I would suggest they probably do... judging by the celebrities who are working with them (list is available on their website). I would think that some of those would be great spokespersons to minority teens.
 
 
 
What about Levi Johnson?

Shouldn't he be getting paid to do the same thing for teen dads?

 

Sponsered by AXE of course.
 
 
 
That's a lot just for having a famous mom.

But really, it's not like she's sharing a rundown studio with her boyfriend and between then two of them they barley makes enough for each other, let alone their baby, and neither of them have enough for daycare so her mom ends up actually raising the kid while the two of them work dead-end jobs for shit pay, only to have it leave their hands in favor of diapers, baby food, doctor checkups, and, if they're lucky after all the bills and sparse groceries are paid for the month, enough spare change to go out to Applebees one night, and that's the only time they actually have for each other.

You think she's gone through any of that? Doubtful. And yet she's giving lectures about the repercussions of teen pregnancy.

 

if thats a yardstick, then no one should be providing lessons or advice based on anything but personal experience(?)

Just think of Snooki like a prison jump suit. She's orange and as soon as she's on you, you begin to regret all the decisions you made in life up to that point.
 
 
 
Who better than a young woman who's 'been there, done that and got the t-shirt'? If her last name wasn't Palin, this wouldn't be an issue.

 

I see you are fine with hypocrites, and thats OK. It's just another person telling kids to do what I say, not what I do.

Also her last name is an issue, her mother wants to be the president and run this country. She expects people to listen to her, but she can't even get her own kids to listen to her. What does this say about her as a parent as well? perhaps if she had been more active in her childs life she wouldn't be a grandmother now. How is that for Family Values.

What if I didn't pimp my child for profit

 

 

  Funny funny.

On a serious note, what do you think now that you know what the ad was about? Do you still feel this way about it?

 
 
And yet she's giving lectures about the repercussions of teen pregnancy.

 

Teen pregnancy sounds awesome based on her life. Everyone should have a baby out of wedlock.

 

 

I liked that message better. Now that I know what she said, she makes it sound like babies are burdens and that she is a victim. If I were a pregnant teen it would inspire me to abort. If I were her kid, I'd feel guilty for the rest of my life.
 
 
 
 
 
And you think I admire Bristol Palin?

It's always good to understand what you read, too

 

My bad. Defending someone you don't admire.

 

Um, because it's the right thing to do?

 

True that.

you laugh all you want - i'll stay over here not caring one whit about what the ad says because the truth is it doesn't matter.

just by having the girl as a spokesperson they're sending the wrong message. she's rich and famous because she was stupid and spread her legs without protection. she's never suffered for that mistake, and she likely never will. she makes teenage pregnancy look glamorous and easy.

frankly, putting her on any kind of pedestal is disgusting.

 

Actually, the ad does quite the opposite. But you wouldn't get that because you haven't watched it. You'd rather remain ignorant and talk out of your ass. She quite clearly takes the glamor OUT of teen pregnancy... and she wasn't the one who made it 'glamorous', that was the media, and stupidly shallow celebs dragging their illegitimate offspring around like fashion accessories.

Again... you're an idiot if you comment before you find out the facts. You are clearly more concerned with her last name than the message... that's pretty fucking stupid.

 

I watched the ad. It doesn't matter. Do what I say, not what I do has never worked and will never work. If she's got all that help and money for being a single mom, why wouldn't another teenager think "Hey, maybe I could do that too?"

 

Well, you're welcome to your opinion - and to ignore the wealth of research that shows the opposite. I personally tend to look at research before I form an opinion.... that's called forming an 'informed opinion'.

Corporations, like Coke, Pepsi, Nike, Adidas, and thousands of others use this kind of advert to promote their products. They do that because they KNOW it works. They KNOW that their target markets are more likely to listen to someone they recognize. This is exactly the same thing. And thousands of charities around the world do the exact same thing - they use celebrities or people who they know will attract the attention of their target audience. That's exactly what the Candie Foundation did.

If you've seen the ad, then I fail to see how you can get the 'Hey, maybe I can do that@ message from it.

If we didn't have a bunch of idiot celebrities dragging their kids around like fashion accessories, we might not have such a large number of teens trying to follow their example. If you're gonna criticize anyone, why not them? Why not the stupid airhead magazines that promote this pathetic 'fame' culture? Why dismiss one girl who's actually trying to do something to change that culture?
 
 
A baby is not a Pepsi. Marketing campaigns that make you want a Pepsi are using positive messaging. Palin is using negative messaging, i.e., babies are bad.

Shelia is exactly correct.

I assume you realize that Bristol didn't actually write the ad, right? That would be done by professional advertising guys. And, no, she wasn't saying 'babies are bad'. But, nice try at spinning. Don't get dizzy, Rav.  

Thousands of charities use this approach - they use it because it's been shown to work. Having a kid in your early teens is not a smart thing to do, all this ad is doing is giving the kids a dose of reality. Babies are not fashion accessories, and life as a teen parent is hard. You disapprove of giving kids a dose of reality?
 
 
Bullshit. She is not saying "babies are bad" She is saying "babies are hard" and anyone who thinks otherwise isn't doing it right.

Wasn't it Mrs Obama that said she didn't want her daughters "burdened with a child"?

maybe i can do what? get pregnant and go on dancing with the stars?

if babies were like soft drinks and sneakers, you'd very likely have a point.

in my informed opinion, they're not, and dragging celebrity idiocy into the debate is a red herring.

kids were having sex loooooong before there were celebrities, idiots or otherwise.
 
 
I disapprove of pimping one's child and making children into burdens. Palin did both.

The issue, for you, is her last name. Simple. No matter what she does, you're gonna slam her for it. Difference between you, and many others on here, and people like Si modo and I is that both Si and I see past her name, or her Mom's political views. We tend to judge individuals as individuals. And, of course, we're both smart enough to get our facts straight before we mouth off.

People on this thread have come up with bullshit excuse after bullshit excuse, each and every one has been shown to be crap.... and still they whine about it. So, if their 'reason's are bullshit, what's left? It has to be about her, not the advert. I'm impressed that so many people can come up with so much bullshit about one 20 year old girl who made a mistake and is now trying to use that experience to help others.

My bad. Defending someone you don't admire.

 

Um, because it's the right thing to do?

 

Bringing up Obama to defend Bristol Palin is the right thing to do?

 

Irrespective of whether I admire a person or not, if I think the attacks are not called for, I defend. That's what you asked, in case you didn't know. I hardly admire the President - not even close - but I defend him often. Just yesterday, for example. It's the right thing to do in my book.

She has previously said, I think, that she wants to use her experience to help others before they get into the same situation. Lots of people use their experiences to help others - and get paid for it. Just look at the amount of 'victims' who write books, get paid to speak, and do exactly what Bristol did... and there is no outrage about it. In fact, quite the opposite. They are considered to be 'brave' for telling their story and using their trauma to help others.

If it's fair criticism, great... but this isn't fair criticism, its' about her Mom. And, for the record, Sarah Palin pisses me off.... and, from the very little I know of Bristol, she would probably piss me off too. But, this ad.... this does not piss me off. I'm interested to see what, if any, further work she does for Candie's. Because, as yet, we do not know that this was $262k for one ad.... it may well be for a years contract to work with them, for all I know. We're all making assumptions about that part.

If Bristol Palin inspires just one girl - just one- to "pause before she plays" she has earned her salary. All "prevention programs" are limited in efficacy. But in this case, it seems cost effective - even without govt dollars. Imagine that.

But, that's not your original question that I answered. Is your memory that poor? Or shall I post the entire exchange for all to see?

With respect to my bringing up Obama, I have no issue with what he did. It's not unusual for any public figure to appear with their children - 'pimping' is what you called it. If bringing one's child into the public eye is always a bad thing - as you imply with your choice of words - you have a bit of perspective, one might hope. Seeing perfection in the human named Obama, you should be familiar with hope.
 
 
From the Candie's Foundation regarding Bristol Palin's involvement:

 the candie's foundation 

For ten years, The Candie's Foundation has been working to prevent teen pregnancy by producing and funding celebrity-driven print, television, radio and online public service announcements. Ms. Palin was compensated for her work with the foundation, which included appearing in video and print PSAs, two town hall meetings, and numerous media interviews.

The message of the foundation about teen pregnancy prevention has generated more than ONE BILLION media impressions  tremendous reach for any teen pregnancy prevention campaign. We know that Ms. Palin's work has had a positive effect on teens. In a recent independent national survey of 1,000 teens that compared a Bristol Palin PSA with those of nother national teen pregnancy organization that use non-famous teens, more than twice as many teens (57% vs. 27%) said Bristol's PSA "got my attention", three times as many (41% vs. 11%) said it was "powerful", and more than twice as many (38% vs. 16%) said it was "memorable".

Bristol Palin is one of dozens of celebrities who has worked with the foundation. She has been a courageous and powerful partner to the foundation as we attempt to discourage teen pregnancy.

Below the above statement is a link to the research, backing up the campaign.

Shockingly, I was correct. She was not paid $262k for one advert. She was paid for a series of work undertaken with the charity.

No, my memory is fine. Here you go. I was wrong about your admiration but you certainly brought up Obama to defend her. I find that amusing.

I'm wondering if that's worse than 'pimping' your children in an election.

Whether she is the right choice for this sort of spokesperson or not, it just doesn't make sense to me why she was chosen if the aim truly is to educate teens. This is just a sweet deal for Bristol. Nothing more.

Some of the attacks on the Palin children are unfair and repulsive. But politicians use their children as political tools. Scenes of families are meant to convey a powerful image in politics. Children are brought into the public arena by their parents for political ends. Because they are political tools, they are subject to public scrutiny. But the type of criticism says volumes about the critics.

Teens viewed four different video PSAs. The two Candie's Foundation PSAs featured Bristol Palin and Jenny McCarthy.

If you look at the stats you provide, Bristol Palin, while beating out two non celebs and Jenny MCCarthy (isn't she that vaccines cause autism fruitcake?), certainly did not do very well in terms of being a convincing spokesperson.

This further strengthens my suspicion that this was all some back roon deal.

Are you a paid Bristol Palin spokesperson, CG? If so, I hope they are making it worthwhile to make such a fool of yourself.
 
 
 
Shouldnt someone that HAS practiced abstinence be the spokesperson for such a thing?
I do admit I cant stand anything Palin, so my opinion is biased and unfair...yes, I do admit that. But still....it seems awfully strange to me they would choose her. A more stable role model would have been better. JMHO.

 

Bristol's a good spokesperson on the topic just as an addict is the person you want to counsel addicts.

Because she has made the mistakes, and the whole world has seen the pain that those mistakes have caused. I think she's a pretty good spokesperson for abstinence.

And remember...abstinence can include virgins...but non-virgins can also choose abstinence. It's never too late to make the right choice! And she's also a good one because she's someone who has a CHILD but now is walking a different path. And it seems to be working for her. Despite the unprecedented and revolting attacks upon her by the left.

I'd believe if I heard it from an independent source.

In January 2011, the Candie's Foundation commissioned YPulse, a youth media research firm, to conduct a survey with 1,000 14-19 year-olds throughout the United States to compare impact and resonance of celebrity-driven teen pregnancy prevention PSAs with non-celebrity PSAs. Teens viewed four different video PSAs. The two Candie's Foundation PSAs featured Bristol Palin and Jenny McCarthy. The two comparison PSAs were produced by a national teen pregnancy prevention organization and featured non-famous teens. All four PSAs have received comparable national media air time. The tables below outline some of the key findings.

If you look at the stats you provide, Bristol Palin, while beating out two non celebs and Jenny MCCarthy (isn't she that vaccines cause autism fruitcake?), certainly did not do very well in terms of being a convincing spokesperson.

This further strengthens my suspicion that this was all some back roon deal.

 

In most areas, Palin and McCarthy did quite well. In the PSA spokesperson category, Palin did at least as well as the other options. Based on the entirety of this research, the foundation made the best non-emotional choice.
 
 
 

Nobody said this shit has to make sense.
 
 
 
 
 
I'd believe if I heard it from an independent source.

 

The charity undertook its own research. You think they want to waste money on a campaign that they haven't researched? Seriously? Is that your stance?    

 

Are you a paid Bristol Palin spokesperson, CG? If so, I hope they are making it worthwhile to make such a fool of yourself.

 

No, I actually avoid reading anything about the girl, or anyone else with the name Palin. I have no dog in the hunt, other than I think the charity know their business better than a bunch of fools on a forum. I've seen bullshit argument after bullshit argument about this... and each and every one of those arguments has proven to have no basis in reality and fact. I like reality. I like facts. I'm big on logic and not overly fond of emotional responses.
 
 
 
bristol palin has been hired to be the poster child for teen abstinence for $262K

really? really.

"Teen mom Bristol Palin, now 20, scored $262,000 in 2009 as Candies Foundation ambassador promoting abstinence.

Let me get this straight: Candies paid a teen mom a quarter-million dollars to tell other teens not to become teen moms?

According to the Candies Web site, Palins job  which she still has  is helping other teens understand the incredible challenges teen parents face, and encouraging them to wait until they are socially and financially independent to start their families.

What incredible challenges? Like walking the red carpet and mastering the paso doble on Dancing with the Stars?"

Most people know that logic, and facts, and critical thought add up to common sense. I'm surprised that you don't, to be honest.

"quite well" ? They all gave a very poor showing. And you have wonder what pitting Bristol against Jenny McCarthy and two unknowns tells you about the intentions of the researchers.

When one has four choices, one of those choices scoring more than 25% is doing pretty well, in my book.

But, that's just me.

Miley Cyrus comes to mind as a better choice for spokesperson.

She's has a huge base of fans among teens. She actually is a good example to the kids, having not had a baby, unlike Miss Palin.

Anyone else have any ideas?

No idea.
But that does bring us back to the issue of the astronomical amount Palin was paid. Something about this whole deal just stinks, IMO.

I assume you have some kind of research to back that up. Some academic research demonstrating the suitability of Ms Cyrus measured against Ms Palin perhaps?

These guys who work for Candie's... they're experts with this target market. They know what does and does not work with teens. They've been running this foundation for 10 years, and they're the charity arm of the fashion brand.

You seem to think this is an 'either/or' thing... it isn't. They may well use Miley... assuming Miley agrees... they use a whole bunch of celebrities in a variety of ways.... you're looking at this as one message... it's not. Its part of a series of messages with a lot of celebs.

I find it sad that people can't see past their own prejudices to see the good that Bristol will do with this.

I imagine Myley Cyrus would have a big ticket cost. But, as I said, I am not up to date on going celebrity rates.

Publicity costs money. It's just the way it is.
