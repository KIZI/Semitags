I admit he wasn't on fire today, but how many jailbreaks were there in
the first quarter alone where G-Men were all over him before he could
even drop back a few steps?

Andy Reid is to blame for the NYG loss.  On every matchup, there was a
mismatch.  The entire game was played in the backfield and Andy Reid is a
gameday buffoon.
