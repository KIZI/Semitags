 
 
The Face of our next President - 2012
 
 
Meet our next President of the United States, Mr. Herman Cain!

       

Self-made millionaire, experienced business leader, talk show host, conservative....in other words, EVERYTHING Obama is not.

Oh yeah, he's black on both sides of his family. Not just one.  

His official website:  Home | TheHermanatorPAC.com - Take back our government 

 

 
Raised in Georgia, Cain adopted the lessons of his parents  dedication to hard work and the importance of faith  and carried them with him to the pinnacle of the corporate world. Cain earned a degree in mathematics from Morehouse College in 1967 and later earned a masters degree in computer science from Purdue University, while working as a mathematician for the Department of the Navy. He then worked as a business analyst for The Coca-Cola Company. In 1968, he married his wife, Gloria and they have two grown children.

In 1977, Herman Cain joined The Pillsbury Company and within three years, at the age of 34, rose to the position of Vice President of Corporate Systems and Services. Cain, reflecting his fathers drive to seek greater challenges, then set his sights on a corporate presidency.

With this goal ahead of him and his mothers faith to support him, Cain resigned his senior position and started on another career path  the restaurant industry. He started from the ground up by making hamburgers at Pillsburys Burger King division. Nine months later, he was managing 400 Burger King units in the Philadelphia region, the countrys poorest performer. Within three years, his region had earned the reputation for excellence and was the companys best.

In 1986, Pillsbury appointed Cain to the presidency of the then financially troubled Godfathers Pizza, Inc. chain headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. In 14 short months, under Cains leadership, the chain regained profitability. In 1988, he led his executive team in a buyout of the company from Pillsbury.

Cain was elected to the Board of Directors of the National Restaurant Association in 1988. In 1994 to 1995, he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors. While leading this association, he developed the organization into a pro-business voice via national debates and speeches concerning health care reform, employment policies, and taxation. Following this experience, he was appointed to serve on the Economic Growth and Tax Reform Commission in addition to serving as Chairman and Member of the Board of Directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. He then became a senior advisor to the 1996 Dole/Kemp campaign for the Presidency.

Herman Cain continued the responsibilities of President and Chairman of Godfathers Pizza, Incorporated, while beginning a second career delivering national keynote speeches. Using his messages as the foundation, he created his own leadership consulting company, The THE New Voice, Inc. THE New Voice packages his speaking and develops his products, including books, DVDs, CDs of gospel music, and promotes his keynote speeches. He has authored four books to date on topics ranging from leadership to self-empowerment including Leadership is Common Sense and CEO of Self.

In 1996, Cain became CEO and President of the National Restaurant Association. He had been a member of the NRA Board since 1988, and had served as its elected volunteer chairman in 1994/1995. Cain thus became the only volunteer chairman to become the full-time CEO and President of the Association while still a member of the Board. Cain headed the NRA in this position for two and a half years.

In 1999, Cain sought to leverage his restaurant experience with the technology market and he became CEO and President of RetailDNA. Its mission is to provide innovative marketing solutions to the retail sector.

Today, Herman is a radio talk show host on The Herman Cain Show out of Atlantas WSB 750am and is a FOX News Business Commentator. Cain remains President and CEO of THE New Voice, Inc. and serves on the Boards of Directors for AGCO Corporation, Hallmark Cards Incorporated and Whirlpool Corporation. In 2004, he ran as a candidate for the United States Senate from Georgia.

The left will brand him the first black racist.
 
 
i too love sarah palin, can't wait till she runs those crooks out of town
 
 
I'd vote for him in Noo Yawk Minute!
 
 
 
I'd vote for him in Noo Yawk Minute!

 

Me too! I think he'll be an excellent President. MUCH better than the current POTUS!

 
 
 
Sorry, in the eyes of the progressives/Marxists on the left.. he's not the right kinda black guy.
 
 
No self made/ambitious/sucessful black people need apply.
 
 
 
The left will brand him the first black racist.

 

hes already been called a "self hating black/uncle tom" on this board
 
 
Yep, love him...we have a couple 3 threads on him already.  

He was proclaimed as a self hating black here.
 
 
 
 
The left will brand him the first black racist.

I did not know that, but I knew it would be coming. Thanks for the info, Dive
 
 
Here's one..

 Calling Tea Party people racist is a S.I.N. 
 
 
 
Yep, love him...we have a couple 3 threads on him already.  

He was proclaimed as a self hating black here.

 

Yeah they tried that shit when he ran for office a few years back. It didn't stick.

He didn't win--only reason was he was running against the incumbent, Johnny Isakson (a true dickhead and dirtbag, I know him personally, almost bought a house from him. He's a shyster).

Had Herman run against someone else, he actually might have won. He's got a LOT of support here in GA.

He's got mine. I was leaning towards Palin, but I'd love to see a Cain/Palin ticket. That would make my day. Cain President, Palin VP.
 
 
 
 
The left will brand him the first black racist.

Don't worry. Herman can handle it. He's tough.

They tried that BS on him here in GA a few years back when he ran against Isakson. Didn't work. He didn't get elected, but then anyone who ran against Isakson would have lost here.

I really hope Cain runs. He's got my vote. My ENTHUSIASTIC VOTE!
 
 
he has my vote.
 
 
if he paired up with sarah palin right now... they would be an unalienable, undeniable force in american political history.

I guess you didn't read my opening post, did you?

I also guess you're not a big Neal Boortz fan either.

Honey it aint ME who's clueless. Nope. That'd be YOU!!

Herman Cain has been on the political scene in GA a long time, he is coming to national prominence due to his talk show on WSB (that's Welcome South Brother to ya'll who don't know what WSB stands for) and Neal Boortz.

Boortz (also on WSB) has a HUGE following and he's touting Herman from the hilltops.

The Hermanator's got a serious shot at the office. Mark my words.

Mr Cain could be interesting. At least he has been in charge of something before. But i'll wait and see how he develops. Just not ready to start supporting anyone for 2012 before the 2010 elections.

He had delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention, he had served as Senator for four years and as a State Assemblyman for eight years. Senator Obama never voted "present" on any bill. That is more conservative nonsense

CEO for a third rate Pizza chain? Not even close

He served in the Senate while he was running...so did John McCain

Politicians have been maintaining their elected positions while they ran for President for 200 years. Its only when Obama ran that it became an issue
 
 
Herman won't run, unless it's on some no-chance party ticket in order to make a political point.

He will never be president.
 
 
 
 
 
Make our day, Herman..Run!!

 

LMAO...the fear is already starting to show through.

I wonder who he would ask to be his VP... He seems ok, I don't like his abortion/gay stance on stuff but I might not know enough in detail.

I honestly wonder if he would ask RP.

Run him and see how many republicans vote for him.

I bet he will get no where with the R base.

I can't agree or disagree. I am interested in hearing more of the man. I certainly don't know enough about him to make a decision today. But I see no reason why the republican base and the conservative community would quickly discount him. He has an interesting background, but I dont know enough about him yet.

Unlike those that jumped on the Obama bandwagon based on strictly his words and vision, with very little concern about his lack of governing experience and even less concern about who he suirrounded himself with as he developed his vision, I am one that properly vets my candidates of choice.

I am curious.....do you believe what you say based on the fact that you beleive the GOP base to not have trust in an African American candidate?

I am curious.....do you believe what you say based on the fact that you beleive the GOP base to not have trust in an African American candidate?

 

He may very well run but as one of two possibilities

- He will enter the early Republican Primaries, get his face on the TV during the debates and drop out after the first two weeks

- He will run as an independent, draw 1% of the vote and be largely ignored
 
 
 
 
 
Run him and see how many republicans vote for him.

I bet he will get no where with the R base.

 

I can't agree or disagree. I am interested in hearing more of the man. I certainly don't know enough about him to make a decision today.

Very dire predicitons for the man.

I am curious what you are basing those predicitons on? Not baiting, I know little about the man. I am really curious what you know that I dont.

Alan Keyes is a good example

Dont forget....Dean lost his bid for thesilliest of reasons...."cheering". Hart lost his bid for his friendhip with a man with a boat that had promoiscuous women on it. Obama won despite the rights efforts regarding his relationships with Wrtight and Ayers.

Times are different.

I no longer look at history to make my judgement calls.

It seems you people forget you are the ONES who claim that having experience in the political forum is a negative.

Remember YOU are the ones who government cant do anything right.

You are teh ones for term limits.

Obama was properly vetted.

You just dont like his vision for the country.

You did like Bush's vision and look how that turned out.

Run this guy and see what happens.

He will never win election.
 
 
So he's essentially the black Mitt Romney, without experience governing.

Uh....excuse me....

But being a CEO is considered experience at governing.

It is experience managing but not experience governing. Knowing the ins and outs of politics within the Beltway, how bills really get passed, how to deal with the powerbrokers are all skills of governing.

CEOs understand the business world, they do not understand politics and are viewed as outsiders

In New Jersey, we elected a man named Jon Corzine who was the former CEO of Goldman Sachs. We expected miracles as an outsider with REAL business experience was going to revolutionize how we did business. That laste about three months and then the realities of NJ politics set in.

Corzine lasted one term and that was too long
 
 
 
 
 
Did I say that? Given the occurances in the past few years with CEO's of large companies, I just don't see America trusting one to lead the country.

 

See how naive they are making you?

10's of thousands of CEO's in the US and a few have issues....and you see it as a CEO problem.

LMAO...the left is making their children look like idiots

 

Love how you twist my words..Nice try, dumbfuck. I never said I HAD A PROBLEM with a CEO.. As long as he/she is not only out for money, but to create a quality product..
I just DON'T SEE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECTING A CEO..Get it now? Prolly not..  
This is all besides the point..You know, and I know..This guy has NO chance at becoming president..  

 

duplicate post.. sorry

The sole job of a CEO is to make sure the company he works for makes money in a legal and ethical manner. That is his ultimate task. The stockholders of a company demand that this be his focus. If I am hiring a CEO, I am hiring a "greedy", but ethical one.

That is a different issue. No experience in beltway politics is your issue and I do not necessarily disagree.....but lately I am wondering whether or not we may be better with politicians that have not been exposed to the bad habits that we now see in washington and continually accept the "thats the way it is done" excuse.

But a congressman with 30 years in the beltway does not necessarily have experience in governing..

Governing is not a political term. It is a term referring to "leading" and "having authority and dsecision making powers"....and yes, is applied to politics as it pertains to mayor, governor and President...but it is also applied to business.

As for Corzine. You said it. At the top of Goldman Sachs. Exactly what was so special about that!  
 
 
 
 
 
LMAO...the fear is already starting to show through.

 

Oh yes. I'm so scared the american people will vote in a CEO as president..  

 

What? As opposed to the young, unqualified, unexperienced KENYAN in office?

Yeah right....you ARE shitting your pants, just like everyone on the left is shtting their pants over the Hermanator!

He IS a force to be reckoned with for 2012!! And the funny part is, YOU LEFTIES KNOW IT!...leaving you in shitty pants with zero clues how to cope and save your Messiah..    

 

You've seen this guy's birth certificate and can prove to us he's American born, right?

(btw, this thread is seriously funny with anyone having any questions being accused of being afraid of this guy.....if that's the criteria of "being afraid", you all must have changed your pants on a daily basis....   )
 
 
 
He was on the board of directors of the National Restaurant Association???

Does he know about the Tea Party belief that a restaurant owner ought to have the right to refuse to serve HIM??

lolol

 

It's really tragically funny that these liberals actually believe their own lies about the Tea Party being racists. Incredible
 
 
 
 
 
He had delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention, he had served as Senator for four years and as a State Assemblyman for eight years

CEO for a third rate Pizza chain? Not even close

 

Actually Barry had been a US Senator less than 2 years when he quit to start his presidential campaign. And I mean quit working as a Senator. But you all knew that.

 

He served in the Senate while he was running...so did John McCain

Politicians have been maintaining their elected positions while they ran for President for 200 years. Its only when Obama ran that it became an issue

 

Voting "present" on numerous bills does not qualify one to become a president no matter how you spin on it, leftwinger.

And Rangel has had tax issues exposed for years, yet he has been re-elected numerous times based on his OTHER accomplishments and ideas.

So would you say his supporters all agree that it is appropriate to break the tax laws? Or do you see it that they beleived that "despite his shortcomings, overall, he is a good candidate with excellent ideas."

Are you telling me that you agreed with everything Obama said he wanted to do when he was on the campaign trail?

And by the way, the position that was widely defended was the premise that a business owner should be allowed to make his own business decisions. If a patron walks in a restaurant and he is not appropriately dressed, he should not have to worry about turning him away and be accused of being a racist if he is black.

Get with the program.

Boston Globe:

THE SPIN: Obama portrays himself as someone voters can trust to tell the truth and skip the usual political games. Clinton and John Edwards are using his "present" votes to offer a different picture -- one of Obama ducking tough issues or refusing to support common-sense legislation.

THE FACTS: Obama acknowledges that over nearly eight years in the Illinois Senate, he voted "present" 129 times. That was out of roughly 4,000 votes he cast, so those "presents" amounted to about one of every 31 votes in his legislative career.
 
 
Well, I can't find a "Present" vote in the U.S. Senate... but I sure see a LOT of "Not Voting"

What's the diff? EIther way it seems he didn't take a stand on a lot of issues.. many of which seem to be defense related.

Just as I expected you to reply. There were no instances in the US Senate where Obama voted present. In the Illinois State Legislature, you are allowed to vote "yay', "nay" or "present". Obama, like other Democratic and Republican State Senators would take advantage of the "present" vote for political reasons. 3% of the votes does not seem excessive

Frankly... I find his voting Present or Not Voting right up there in signifigance with his lack of knowledge of "Snookie".

Hell, I never heard of Snookie.

Obama's wife was disbarred? When did that happen? And under what circumstances?

RW..you're a fucking dumbass who gives the right a bad name. I wish Gunnyfuck would make you change your username. It's fucking FALSE advertising. That'd be like me calling myself "Leftwinger".

I'm sure you'd that shit with a stick, huh?

Fuck off dipshit.

 

You MUSt be a Leftwinger, because we've been assured by two Rightwing posters here that it is only Progressives/Leftists who use epithets and are rude in their posting.

It is your true seaside "fun in the sun" town.

Spring Lake is great but with less of the "attractions". DJ's in Belmar (next town over) makes Spring Lake attractive to the younger (20's) crowd.

Wildwood is the best, but a much longer ride from the NYC area.

And then there is AC...my kind of town. Surf, boardwalk, attractions, glitz...and yes....CRAPS.....the game of all games.

Dating myself of course.
 
 
so um, what exactly are his positions on anything? the only thing I have found about him is on his wiki page and the only issue it says hes against abortion even in the case of incest or rape, which makes me think he is quite the authoritarian

I love that town. Go trhere about 6 times a year. Used to get comped at the Trop...and then I tried the new Water Club on the marina side. They treat you like a King there.

I dont gamble big. I gamble long. I play craps and I make my money last by always hedging my bets. 6 hours of free drinking, lots of laughs and lots of excitement. When I win a roll, I tip the table...so it is rare I walk away a winner, but rare I lose more than 200.

LMAO...I had a memebership to the Playboy Club in Mnahattan back in the 80's. Went there once, saw there were no naked women and never wnet back. Ah, to be young again!

Despite being a conservative, that "abortions should be illegal" thing is a turn off to me. Fortunately, I dont think we will ever have a congress again that will allow a vote like that to ever go through....so it is not as much an issue to me for a Presidential candidate.

But like you, I know very little about this man. I am sure the far left will let us know he was the first one to pound a stake into Jesus' wrist and the far right will remind us that he was the founder of sliced bread and swiss cheese.

Over 4 years in the US Senate.....find a single bill where he voted "present"

 

Barack Obama has claimed that he foresaw the subprime mortgage collapse and took steps to warn the Treasury — by writing a letter. That claim has come in two presidential debates. Peter Wallison reminds Wall Street Journal readers of the obvious in pointing out that Obama serves as a Senator and had the power to draft legislation, not letters, to prevent the collapse. Instead, Obama voted present
 Hot Air Obama voted “present” on Fannie/Freddie reform 

Now what sonny? Feeling a little foolish?

Now, as a state senator?????

In 1999, Barack Obama was faced with a difficult vote in the Illinois legislature — to support a bill that would let some juveniles be tried as adults, a position that risked drawing fire from African-Americans, or to oppose it, possibly undermining his image as a tough-on-crime moderate.

In the end, Mr. Obama chose neither to vote for nor against the bill. He voted “present,” effectively sidestepping the issue, an option he invoked nearly 130 times as a state senator

Yes, leftwinger.....Barry had the experience to become president of the greatest nation on Earth.

so does this guy have a list of positions somewhere?
 
 
 
 
 
It is your true seaside "fun in the sun" town.

Spring Lake is great but with less of the "attractions". DJ's in Belmar (next town over) makes Spring Lake attractive to the younger (20's) crowd.

Wildwood is the best, but a much longer ride from the NYC area.

And then there is AC...my kind of town. Surf, boardwalk, attractions, glitz...and yes....CRAPS.....the game of all games.

 

Last time I was in AC.. they still had a Playboy Club. LOL!!!

Dating myself of course.

 

I love that town. Go trhere about 6 times a year. Used to get comped at the Trop...and then I tried the new Water Club on the marina side. They treat you like a King there.

I dont gamble big. I gamble long. I play craps and I make my money last by always hedging my bets. 6 hours of free drinking, lots of laughs and lots of excitement. When I win a roll, I tip the table...so it is rare I walk away a winner, but rare I lose more than 200.

LMAO...I had a memebership to the Playboy Club in Mnahattan back in the 80's. Went there once, saw there were no naked women and never wnet back. Ah, to be young again!

 

LOL...I had the same experience at the Playboy Club

Went to the one in LA in the late 70s. I remember drinks were $7 at a time most bars had drinks for a buck. Bunnies were stuck-up and didn't show anything

We ended up going to a strip club
 
 
 
 
 
Please do...

But accurately reflect I said Senator Obama. Good luck in finding any Senate Bill where he voted "Present"

 

Boston Globe:

THE SPIN: Obama portrays himself as someone voters can trust to tell the truth and skip the usual political games. Clinton and John Edwards are using his "present" votes to offer a different picture -- one of Obama ducking tough issues or refusing to support common-sense legislation.

THE FACTS: Obama acknowledges that over nearly eight years in the Illinois Senate, he voted "present" 129 times. That was out of roughly 4,000 votes he cast, so those "presents" amounted to about one of every 31 votes in his legislative career.

 

Just as I expected you to reply. There were no instances in the US Senate where Obama voted present. In the Illinois State Legislature, you are allowed to vote "yay', "nay" or "present". Obama, like other Democratic and Republican State Senators would take advantage of the "present" vote for political reasons. 3% of the votes does not seem excessive

 

I've already outted you on your lack of knowledge on this subject, leftwinger.
 
 
 
The Face of our next President - 2012

 

 
 
 
 
so does this guy have a list of positions somewhere?

 

I think he wrote a book on Yoga maybe?
 
 
okay I googled the guy's name followed by "issues" and found a wnd story about him:

 Is this man Obama's worst nightmare? 

so here is some stuff about him from the article

1) he is active with the tea party

2) his views on immigration

"For true immigration reform, Cain said, the U.S. must 1) secure the border, 2) enforce the current laws and 3) streamline the process for becoming a U.S. citizen. "

"Failure to enforce the current immigration laws is just negligence by the federal government," Cain said. "And when Arizona wants to do something to protect itself, it gets sued. I am on Arizona's side of this fight."

He added, "Lastly, no one has reviewed the process for becoming a citizen since dirt! Just ask people who have done it the right way about how frustrating it is."

3) obama care / financial reform

"As for Obamacare, Cain said, "We have to first take back control of the House of Representatives and start a process to repeal it. You'll never repeal it under Obama, but you can at least slow it down."

He added, "One of the biggest challenges of 2010 is to take back the House so we can slow down health-care deform, cap-and-trade deform and financial deform. That's our highest priority."

4) he is against aborition even in rape/incest

5) he sounds like a warhawk/neocon in respect to foreign policy

6)" Finally, he recommends replacing the tax code with a Fair Tax, which would replace federal income taxes with a national consumption tax on retail sales. "
 
 
Barack Obama missed 314 (24%) of 1,300 roll call votes since Jan 6, 2005. The graph below shows the percent of roll call votes Barack Obama was absent for during the Member’s time in Congress.The absentee rate is in red. The two thin black lines provide a context for understanding the significance of the absentee rate. The lower dotted line shows the median value for all Members of Congress in that time period. The upper dotted line shows the 90th percentile. A Member who approaches the upper dotted line is in the worst 10 percent of Congress

Balance a checkbook goes a long ways these days? Are you kidding me?
WRONG!

Nowadays, if you do not balance your checkbook, you are a victim of some unscrupulous creditor and you are given a pass for being misled...and you are put at the head of the line for all the goodies those bad bad people will be forced to give you.

Nope. Better off not balancing your checkbook. If you do, you MUST be one of those unscrupulous rich evil predatory people.

As TM said, he won't get any support because the TP is a bunch of racists, he was lucky to make it out of that TP rally alive from the looks of it.

Hint to the clueless: The Cain website is a PAC.

Also note: Herman Cain is NOT a "candidate"---yet. He is exploring a run for 2012 and guaging the support ($$) he would be able to raise to see if he would even be a viable candidate before he OFFICIALLY tosses his hat in the ring.

Happens all the time in politics.

Anyway, you claim to be smart. If you're smarter than me, why do I have to spoon feed you information on Herman Cain? I'm sure if you're as smart as you claim to be, you can locate the answers to any questions you have on this great big old wild wild web AlBore created all by his lonesome!

No, I am not for politicians in bed with corporations. In fact, I don't think corporations ought to have ANY say in our government and ESPECIALLY not in out election process, but they do. They have WAY too much influence. They are NOT people. And yes, I do think 99% of people at the heads of corporations are corrupt - how can you not be when everything you are about is squeezing the most $$$ out of your citezenry.

He was on the board of directors of the National Restaurant Association???

Does he know about the Tea Party belief that a restaurant owner ought to have the right to refuse to serve HIM??

lolol

 

proof that that was said by a tea party person?

and i know who said it

 

Here you go...now you can spin this.

 Taylor Marsh: Rand Paul on Civil Rights: Private Restaurants Wouldn't Have To Serve Martin Luther King 

 

yes, Rand Paul
now tie him to the tea party
 
 
So, the Right failed miserably with McCain, so they think they will do any better by lopping off the 'Mc'? In 2016, they just need to find an Asian candidate with the last name 'Ain'. LOL!

but "not voting" could be the same thing
 
 
 
 
Frankly... I find his voting Present or Not Voting right up there in signifigance with his lack of knowledge of "Snookie".

Hell, I never heard of Snookie.

 

Unfortunately, living in New Jersey...I knew who Snookie was

and I am worse off for it

 

i didnt know till i read it on here, and all i know is shes on some jersey reality show and not WHO she is

Really? How uncorrupted was Halliburton when they fucked up the barracks in Baghdad, and made a shithole out of Walter Reed by doing shoddy work and cutting corners? How about the fucked up way they made the BOP valves?

What about the dirty deals BP made with Cheney in the White House?

What about the fact that the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig was registered in the Maldives because their requirements for passing inspection were minimal?

That's just 3 examples. Wanna talk Freddie and Fannie, Goldman Sachs, or any of the other Wall St. corporations?

99 percent of the corporations are honest? BULLSHIT!

you should reread what he said
i bolded the part it seems you didnt read properly
 
 
The CEO's are the ones that decide the direction of the company.

Yes, they are corrupt as they value cutting corners and doing shoddy work to maximize profits over doing their fucking job.

45 soldiers were electrocuted to death in Baghdad in the showers built by Halliburton.

Meet our next President of the United States, Mr. Herman Cain!

       

Self-made millionaire, experienced business leader, talk show host, conservative....in other words, EVERYTHING Obama is not.

Oh yeah, he's black on both sides of his family. Not just one.  

His official website:  Home | TheHermanatorPAC.com - Take back our government 

 

 
Raised in Georgia, Cain adopted the lessons of his parents  dedication to hard work and the importance of faith  and carried them with him to the pinnacle of the corporate world. Cain earned a degree in mathematics from Morehouse College in 1967 and later earned a masters degree in computer science from Purdue University, while working as a mathematician for the Department of the Navy. He then worked as a business analyst for The Coca-Cola Company. In 1968, he married his wife, Gloria and they have two grown children.

In 1977, Herman Cain joined The Pillsbury Company and within three years, at the age of 34, rose to the position of Vice President of Corporate Systems and Services. Cain, reflecting his fathers drive to seek greater challenges, then set his sights on a corporate presidency.

With this goal ahead of him and his mothers faith to support him, Cain resigned his senior position and started on another career path  the restaurant industry. He started from the ground up by making hamburgers at Pillsburys Burger King division. Nine months later, he was managing 400 Burger King units in the Philadelphia region, the countrys poorest performer. Within three years, his region had earned the reputation for excellence and was the companys best.

In 1986, Pillsbury appointed Cain to the presidency of the then financially troubled Godfathers Pizza, Inc. chain headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. In 14 short months, under Cains leadership, the chain regained profitability. In 1988, he led his executive team in a buyout of the company from Pillsbury.

Cain was elected to the Board of Directors of the National Restaurant Association in 1988. In 1994 to 1995, he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors. While leading this association, he developed the organization into a pro-business voice via national debates and speeches concerning health care reform, employment policies, and taxation. Following this experience, he was appointed to serve on the Economic Growth and Tax Reform Commission in addition to serving as Chairman and Member of the Board of Directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. He then became a senior advisor to the 1996 Dole/Kemp campaign for the Presidency.

Herman Cain continued the responsibilities of President and Chairman of Godfathers Pizza, Incorporated, while beginning a second career delivering national keynote speeches. Using his messages as the foundation, he created his own leadership consulting company, The THE New Voice, Inc. THE New Voice packages his speaking and develops his products, including books, DVDs, CDs of gospel music, and promotes his keynote speeches. He has authored four books to date on topics ranging from leadership to self-empowerment including Leadership is Common Sense and CEO of Self.

In 1996, Cain became CEO and President of the National Restaurant Association. He had been a member of the NRA Board since 1988, and had served as its elected volunteer chairman in 1994/1995. Cain thus became the only volunteer chairman to become the full-time CEO and President of the Association while still a member of the Board. Cain headed the NRA in this position for two and a half years.

In 1999, Cain sought to leverage his restaurant experience with the technology market and he became CEO and President of RetailDNA. Its mission is to provide innovative marketing solutions to the retail sector.

Today, Herman is a radio talk show host on The Herman Cain Show out of Atlantas WSB 750am and is a FOX News Business Commentator. Cain remains President and CEO of THE New Voice, Inc. and serves on the Boards of Directors for AGCO Corporation, Hallmark Cards Incorporated and Whirlpool Corporation. In 2004, he ran as a candidate for the United States Senate from Georgia.

The NEGRO who leads your bankrupt nation today will lead it in 2012. He will bring even more of his close NEGRO friends into the inner cabinet of Government. When the Negro Obama is finished you wont know your country.
 
 
 
 
 
Would America ever elect a President with the first name of Herman?  

 

Americans don't vote for presidents with funny sounding names

 

If anything, Barack Hussein Obama certainly proved that one wrong.

 

I was thinking about George Bush
 
 
Why can't people just let things play out? "Fear"?? Not yet.

It may come as a surprise to younguns new to politics that most mature adults thoroughly vet presidential candidates in their own minds, regardless of party, and vote accordingly. So if this man Cain proves to be a viable candidate, depending on other circumstances in 2011/12, he might have a lot of our votes that aren't necessarily "conservative" votes you would expect. But I can tell you right now, if the campaign gets down and dirty by conservatives already jumping in by accusing the left of "fear" and all sorts of other silly projections, you will lose votes just out of spite.
 
 
 
 
 
AMEN on that!  

 

 

you need to see his birth certificate.
the long form. each on of you, personally.

 

No prob. Sitting here in the filing cabinet on the left side of my desk. Where you want me to send it?

Post the address here in THIS THREAD and I'll send it to you.

NO PO BOXES OR MAIL SERVICES ALLOWED--- YOUR PERSONAL HOME ADDRESS posted IN THIS THREAD will get you a copy of my original, State of XXXXXXXX certified birth certificate.

Got the guts to back up that request, L.K. ?? Yeah, didn't think so. Dumbass!  

 

Ohhhh, so much anger, so little time. But wait. Two years is a LOT of time...in which to get this guy shoved off the radar by your screams (which are sure to be matched by louder screams), to the point there will be all sorts of websites calling for his destruction and the loons on the left will believe it all and...well...you get the gist. It won't be perty, but you guys should have thought of the repercussions for your own vile activities against first Hillary Clinton and then Barack Obama.

And by the way, just a hint. If Mr. Cain does have class, I don't think he will enjoy being called "The Herminator."
 
 
 
 
 
Make our day, Herman..Run!!

 

AMEN on that!  

 

 

Run, Herman, Run!!

Keep scaring the SHIT out of the lefties, Obama and his disbarred lawyer wife.  

Gotta love it....  

 

"I saw it on the Internets, so it must be true!!" Jeny, you are such a gullible fruitfly.

Michelle Obama was licensed to practice law in 1989 by the State of Illinois Supreme Court. In 1993, she became voluntarily inactive.

Illinois Registration Status: Voluntarily inactive and not authorized to practice law  Last Registered Year: 1993

There were no disciplinary proceedings against her license of any kind:

Public Record of Discipline and Pending Proceedings: None

(in other words, she chose a different career, that is the only reason why she no longer practices law)
 
 
 
 
 
What? As opposed to the young, unqualified, unexperienced KENYAN in office?

Yeah right....you ARE shitting your pants, just like everyone on the left is shtting their pants over the Hermanator!

He IS a force to be reckoned with for 2012!! And the funny part is, YOU LEFTIES KNOW IT!...leaving you in shitty pants with zero clues how to cope and save your Messiah..    

 

What is in the water you are drinking?

The guy is not even a blip on the radar. Seems like a nice guy...but not a prayer

His resume is uninspiring. He is not even a top CEO

 

I guess you didn't read my opening post, did you?

I also guess you're not a big Neal Boortz fan either.

Honey it aint ME who's clueless. Nope. That'd be YOU!!

Herman Cain has been on the political scene in GA a long time, he is coming to national prominence due to his talk show on WSB (that's Welcome South Brother to ya'll who don't know what WSB stands for) and Neal Boortz.

Boortz (also on WSB) has a HUGE following and he's touting Herman from the hilltops.

The Hermanator's got a serious shot at the office. Mark my words.

 

What's so great about Neal Boortz? Except that he's just another Andrew Breitbart.
 
 
 
Would America ever elect a President with the first name of Herman?  

 

Why not? We've had a Ulysses and a Woodrow.

OH My goodness......I stand corrected

Neil Boortz

 

 
 
 
 
Sorry, in the eyes of the progressives/Marxists on the left.. he's not the right kinda black guy.

 

Which is why we are right when we say they are the REAL racists.

They expect Blacks to live up to what THEY think they are, and not be what they really are. Free thinking people.
 
 
 
 
Run him and see how many republicans vote for him.

I bet he will get no where with the R base.

 

I can't agree or disagree. I am interested in hearing more of the man. I certainly don't know enough about him to make a decision today. But I see no reason why the republican base and the conservative community would quickly discount him. He has an interesting background, but I dont know enough about him yet.

Unlike those that jumped on the Obama bandwagon based on strictly his words and vision, with very little concern about his lack of governing experience and even less concern about who he suirrounded himself with as he developed his vision, I am one that properly vets my candidates of choice.

I am curious.....do you believe what you say based on the fact that you beleive the GOP base to not have trust in an African American candidate?

 

I was frankly surprised that Obama made it through the primaries. Although I always liked what he had to say, I really hadn't followed his career at all. But he got where he did in the primaries because of a near-perfect campaign strategy which brought in tons of money to keep him going. Then, of course, when it came down to the wire between him and Hillary, Obama squeaked out the final votes that put him over the top. After that, he was the candidate for 2008 for the Democratic Party and he would therefore get their votes. There was nothing fishy about it at all. He was the party's choice, period. If Hillary had won, the right would have been trashing her 24/7 as well.

But if Obama could pull it out, there's no reason to believe someone like Cain couldn't as well. Everything depends on the condition of the country at the time, and in 2008, the country was ready for a major change in leadership. If they're ready for another change by 2012, so be it.

Ya know if I had 3 red dots by my rep column, I think I'd Just slink on outa here.
 
 
Hey Maggie......Charles Bass actually had medals for being a prick. Get enough red dots and you get a big red star that looks like an explosion.

I think Bass was up to 3 before he took a break and came back as Bass 2.0.
 
 
 
i too love sarah palin, can't wait till she runs those crooks out of town

 

I hope Palin doesn't run. I want the next Presidential election to be about IDEAS and the differences in political philosophy being presented to voters. NOT another race about personalities when the media is already itching to set her up and embarrass her while pretending that proves how "stupid" she is.

She isn't the best candidate in 2012 and frankly may never be the right person because she already has way too much baggage. But PLEASE, someone darn well better step up to the plate who is better than Romney of all people. Not another RINO please!

he has 4 now  
 
 
 
Uninspiring resume

There are thousands of Americans better suited for President

Godfathers Pizza sucks...if he was any good he would have figured out how to make a decent pizza

 

that's really rich, coming from an Obama supporter.
 
 
Yeah, the Wasilla Chihuahua turned Momma Gerbil has got even MORE baggage to screw with her now....

Seems that Levi Johnson got back together with Bristol, BUT..........during their time apart, he seems to have knocked up Bristol's best friend.

Interestingly enough, there are 2 other dudes in contention for the prize.

Who says that the Wasilla Chihuahua's family isn't a bunch of slow rednecks? Shit........Obama did a stint on the View.

Looks like Palin is gonna go Jerry Springer...........
 
 
 
 
 
It's a toss up for me at least. I like Alan West.

 

giant picture removed.

 

That would be Adam West, not Allen West.

 Allen West (politician) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 

My error.  

Is Adam West running anywhere? I'd have to vote for Batman.

Btw, do you think he tagged that ass?

Meet our next President of the United States, Mr. Herman Cain!

       

Self-made millionaire, experienced business leader, talk show host, conservative....in other words, EVERYTHING Obama is not.

Oh yeah, he's black on both sides of his family. Not just one.  

His official website:  Home | TheHermanatorPAC.com - Take back our government 

 

 
Raised in Georgia, Cain adopted the lessons of his parents  dedication to hard work and the importance of faith  and carried them with him to the pinnacle of the corporate world. Cain earned a degree in mathematics from Morehouse College in 1967 and later earned a masters degree in computer science from Purdue University, while working as a mathematician for the Department of the Navy. He then worked as a business analyst for The Coca-Cola Company. In 1968, he married his wife, Gloria and they have two grown children.

In 1977, Herman Cain joined The Pillsbury Company and within three years, at the age of 34, rose to the position of Vice President of Corporate Systems and Services. Cain, reflecting his fathers drive to seek greater challenges, then set his sights on a corporate presidency.

With this goal ahead of him and his mothers faith to support him, Cain resigned his senior position and started on another career path  the restaurant industry. He started from the ground up by making hamburgers at Pillsburys Burger King division. Nine months later, he was managing 400 Burger King units in the Philadelphia region, the countrys poorest performer. Within three years, his region had earned the reputation for excellence and was the companys best.

In 1986, Pillsbury appointed Cain to the presidency of the then financially troubled Godfathers Pizza, Inc. chain headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. In 14 short months, under Cains leadership, the chain regained profitability. In 1988, he led his executive team in a buyout of the company from Pillsbury.

Cain was elected to the Board of Directors of the National Restaurant Association in 1988. In 1994 to 1995, he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors. While leading this association, he developed the organization into a pro-business voice via national debates and speeches concerning health care reform, employment policies, and taxation. Following this experience, he was appointed to serve on the Economic Growth and Tax Reform Commission in addition to serving as Chairman and Member of the Board of Directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. He then became a senior advisor to the 1996 Dole/Kemp campaign for the Presidency.

Herman Cain continued the responsibilities of President and Chairman of Godfathers Pizza, Incorporated, while beginning a second career delivering national keynote speeches. Using his messages as the foundation, he created his own leadership consulting company, The THE New Voice, Inc. THE New Voice packages his speaking and develops his products, including books, DVDs, CDs of gospel music, and promotes his keynote speeches. He has authored four books to date on topics ranging from leadership to self-empowerment including Leadership is Common Sense and CEO of Self.

In 1996, Cain became CEO and President of the National Restaurant Association. He had been a member of the NRA Board since 1988, and had served as its elected volunteer chairman in 1994/1995. Cain thus became the only volunteer chairman to become the full-time CEO and President of the Association while still a member of the Board. Cain headed the NRA in this position for two and a half years.

In 1999, Cain sought to leverage his restaurant experience with the technology market and he became CEO and President of RetailDNA. Its mission is to provide innovative marketing solutions to the retail sector.

Today, Herman is a radio talk show host on The Herman Cain Show out of Atlantas WSB 750am and is a FOX News Business Commentator. Cain remains President and CEO of THE New Voice, Inc. and serves on the Boards of Directors for AGCO Corporation, Hallmark Cards Incorporated and Whirlpool Corporation. In 2004, he ran as a candidate for the United States Senate from Georgia.

I think the only way Republicans can defeat Obama is to run a black candidate of their own. That way the liberal white guilt vote will be split. Since this candidate is all black rather than half black, he should easily defeat Obama

I think just about anyone could have beat McCain and the republicans. There was definitely an anti republican mood going on in 2008. McCain was not a good choice, but glad he is toast from now on.

You do realize that the archaic and outdated (and racist come to think of it) definition of "black" is the "one drop rule"?

He served in the Senate while he was running...so did John McCain

Politicians have been maintaining their elected positions while they ran for President for 200 years. Its only when Obama ran that it became an issue

 

Voting "present" on numerous bills does not qualify one to become a president no matter how you spin on it, leftwinger.

 

Rightwinger posted a few posts back that Obama NEVER voted Present on ANY bill.

Ok... lets show her to be the ignorant liar that she is...

 

I can do better then that
 Obama said oops on 6 state Senate votes - latimes.com 

In 1999, Barack Obama was faced with a difficult vote in the Illinois legislature  to support a bill that would let some juveniles be tried as adults, a position that risked drawing fire from African-Americans, or to oppose it, possibly undermining his image as a tough-on-crime moderate.
In the end, Mr. Obama chose neither to vote for nor against the bill. He voted present, effectively sidestepping the issue, an option he invoked nearly 130 times as a state senator.
 http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/us...s/20obama.html 

THE FACTS: Obama acknowledges that over nearly eight years in the Illinois Senate, he voted "present" 129 times. That was out of roughly 4,000 votes he cast, so those "presents" amounted to about one of every 31 votes in his legislative career.

Run him and see how many republicans vote for him.

I bet he will get no where with the R base.

 

I can't agree or disagree. I am interested in hearing more of the man. I certainly don't know enough about him to make a decision today. But I see no reason why the republican base and the conservative community would quickly discount him. He has an interesting background, but I dont know enough about him yet.

Unlike those that jumped on the Obama bandwagon based on strictly his words and vision, with very little concern about his lack of governing experience and even less concern about who he suirrounded himself with as he developed his vision, I am one that properly vets my candidates of choice.

I am curious.....do you believe what you say based on the fact that you beleive the GOP base to not have trust in an African American candidate?

 

I was frankly surprised that Obama made it through the primaries. Although I always liked what he had to say, I really hadn't followed his career at all. But he got where he did in the primaries because of a near-perfect campaign strategy which brought in tons of money to keep him going. Then, of course, when it came down to the wire between him and Hillary, Obama squeaked out the final votes that put him over the top. After that, he was the candidate for 2008 for the Democratic Party and he would therefore get their votes. There was nothing fishy about it at all. He was the party's choice, period. If Hillary had won, the right would have been trashing her 24/7 as well.

But if Obama could pull it out, there's no reason to believe someone like Cain couldn't as well. Everything depends on the condition of the country at the time, and in 2008, the country was ready for a major change in leadership. If they're ready for another change by 2012, so be it.

 

Obammy won because he spent 730,000,000 Soros dollars and whimpy assed, guilt ridden,
assholes. Hell, a lot of the nitwits that voted for that fuck just did so because the media kept telling them it was historic.
 
 
 
 
Meet our next President of the United States, Mr. Herman Cain!

       

Self-made millionaire, experienced business leader, talk show host, conservative....in other words, EVERYTHING Obama is not.

Oh yeah, he's black on both sides of his family. Not just one.

Sorry sweetheart. No excecutive experience. As I recall, you guys had major flatulance over that point.

By the way...what's the deal with being purebred black instead of a mutt? You got something against mutt?

You do realize that the archaic and outdated (and racist come to think of it) definition of "black" is the "one drop rule"?

 

Jackson and Sharpton both said he didn't have slave blood so he wasn't an authentic American black person........talk to them.

To a liberal, McCain was better than anyone, leftwinger. What would you know about anything else? He was too liberal for the republican base, and wouldn't have been nominated if it wasn't for the media.

 

I love this "it was the media's fault" stuff.      

 

your in denial, huh?      

He was running in last place and running thin on the money, and the media picked him up, Biden said McCain was a man he could vote for, yes Bo.....the media.  

 

Too funny!!!!       Nothing about maybe millions voting for him. No, that is nothing.      
 
 
Adam West as understand it is a supported of homosexual rights and that makes him in eligible to seek office as a member of the GOP.

Not just white guilt, ignorance of how a supposedly(anyone seen the actual transcripts or talked to anyone that was in school with the clown?) superior Ivy League education doesn't necessarily mean someone can run a lemonade stand much less be President. Most could easily be talked into a pile of shit car by a skilled used car salesman. Same people that were ignorant enough to believe that President Bush was an idiot even though he had a much more diverse Ivy League education than the law school Barry attended. They assumed that President Bush was an idiot because he wasn't a smooth salesman like talker. President Bush was handed a much bigger problem in his first 8 months than Barry can imagine and yet the stock market was at 14,000 five years later(before the Democrats took over Congress)and the airlines that were almost put out of business had come back stronger than ever. Barry and his asswipes in Congress have taken what should have been a light recession and turned it into a rare double dip recession in a mere 18 months......... no real signs of consumer or business confidence and unemployment higher since Carter. You leftist sure have a clue.......NOT!

You know, stating that the media got Obama elected because he was a black man and it would have been "historic" is a bullshit argument.

It would have been "historic" if McStupid got elected as well, because the Wasilla Chihuahua turned Momma Gerbil would have been the first FEMALE VP.

Would have been "historic" either way.

Herman will not win if he runs. He will not even get the Republican nod.

Nothing against the man, but politics is a game of compromise. Always has, always will be. He doesn't compromise one iota, and some of his positions are sure to turn off the majority of voters.

He's a likeable guy that's all he has going for him. He is losing those who helped him win the 2008 election. You can continue to believe as you do, but it will not change a thing if the election was right now he would lose.

OH why are the democrats running as far away from obama as possible? Why did the clintons shun obama and the wedding? And do not believe that BS about taking away from their daughter. They didn't even send him and invite to the reception. It may have been a shun but then it might have been fear of the wedding gift. obama has a bad history on giving gifts.
 
 
America has a Negro President now and he will be re-elected (the best the GOP has to offer is a dumb Bimbo who likes to shoot wolves from an aircraft). When the Negro Obama completes his second term he will be followed by Mrs W.J. Clinton aka Hillary who will sit in the Ovary Office for eight years. By the time another right-wing, Christiaon zealot (Republican) is elected most of you idiots will be pushing up flowers.

You keep on rocking Herman Cain !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
 
 
 
Meet our next President of the United States, Mr. Herman Cain!

       

Self-made millionaire, experienced business leader, talk show host, conservative....in other words, EVERYTHING Obama is not.

Oh yeah, he's black on both sides of his family. Not just one.  

His official website:  Home | TheHermanatorPAC.com - Take back our government 

 

 
Raised in Georgia, Cain adopted the lessons of his parents  dedication to hard work and the importance of faith  and carried them with him to the pinnacle of the corporate world. Cain earned a degree in mathematics from Morehouse College in 1967 and later earned a masters degree in computer science from Purdue University, while working as a mathematician for the Department of the Navy. He then worked as a business analyst for The Coca-Cola Company. In 1968, he married his wife, Gloria and they have two grown children.

In 1977, Herman Cain joined The Pillsbury Company and within three years, at the age of 34, rose to the position of Vice President of Corporate Systems and Services. Cain, reflecting his fathers drive to seek greater challenges, then set his sights on a corporate presidency.

With this goal ahead of him and his mothers faith to support him, Cain resigned his senior position and started on another career path  the restaurant industry. He started from the ground up by making hamburgers at Pillsburys Burger King division. Nine months later, he was managing 400 Burger King units in the Philadelphia region, the countrys poorest performer. Within three years, his region had earned the reputation for excellence and was the companys best.

In 1986, Pillsbury appointed Cain to the presidency of the then financially troubled Godfathers Pizza, Inc. chain headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. In 14 short months, under Cains leadership, the chain regained profitability. In 1988, he led his executive team in a buyout of the company from Pillsbury.

Cain was elected to the Board of Directors of the National Restaurant Association in 1988. In 1994 to 1995, he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors. While leading this association, he developed the organization into a pro-business voice via national debates and speeches concerning health care reform, employment policies, and taxation. Following this experience, he was appointed to serve on the Economic Growth and Tax Reform Commission in addition to serving as Chairman and Member of the Board of Directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. He then became a senior advisor to the 1996 Dole/Kemp campaign for the Presidency.

Herman Cain continued the responsibilities of President and Chairman of Godfathers Pizza, Incorporated, while beginning a second career delivering national keynote speeches. Using his messages as the foundation, he created his own leadership consulting company, The THE New Voice, Inc. THE New Voice packages his speaking and develops his products, including books, DVDs, CDs of gospel music, and promotes his keynote speeches. He has authored four books to date on topics ranging from leadership to self-empowerment including Leadership is Common Sense and CEO of Self.

In 1996, Cain became CEO and President of the National Restaurant Association. He had been a member of the NRA Board since 1988, and had served as its elected volunteer chairman in 1994/1995. Cain thus became the only volunteer chairman to become the full-time CEO and President of the Association while still a member of the Board. Cain headed the NRA in this position for two and a half years.

Meet our next President of the United States, Mr. Herman Cain!

       

Self-made millionaire, experienced business leader, talk show host, conservative....in other words, EVERYTHING Obama is not.

Oh yeah, he's black on both sides of his family. Not just one.

Raised in Georgia, Cain adopted the lessons of his parents  dedication to hard work and the importance of faith  and carried them with him to the pinnacle of the corporate world. Cain earned a degree in mathematics from Morehouse College in 1967 and later earned a masters degree in computer science from Purdue University, while working as a mathematician for the Department of the Navy. He then worked as a business analyst for The Coca-Cola Company. In 1968, he married his wife, Gloria and they have two grown children.

In 1977, Herman Cain joined The Pillsbury Company and within three years, at the age of 34, rose to the position of Vice President of Corporate Systems and Services. Cain, reflecting his fathers drive to seek greater challenges, then set his sights on a corporate presidency.

With this goal ahead of him and his mothers faith to support him, Cain resigned his senior position and started on another career path  the restaurant industry. He started from the ground up by making hamburgers at Pillsburys Burger King division. Nine months later, he was managing 400 Burger King units in the Philadelphia region, the countrys poorest performer. Within three years, his region had earned the reputation for excellence and was the companys best.

In 1986, Pillsbury appointed Cain to the presidency of the then financially troubled Godfathers Pizza, Inc. chain headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. In 14 short months, under Cains leadership, the chain regained profitability. In 1988, he led his executive team in a buyout of the company from Pillsbury.

Cain was elected to the Board of Directors of the National Restaurant Association in 1988. In 1994 to 1995, he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors. While leading this association, he developed the organization into a pro-business voice via national debates and speeches concerning health care reform, employment policies, and taxation. Following this experience, he was appointed to serve on the Economic Growth and Tax Reform Commission in addition to serving as Chairman and Member of the Board of Directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. He then became a senior advisor to the 1996 Dole/Kemp campaign for the Presidency.

Herman Cain continued the responsibilities of President and Chairman of Godfathers Pizza, Incorporated, while beginning a second career delivering national keynote speeches. Using his messages as the foundation, he created his own leadership consulting company, The THE New Voice, Inc. THE New Voice packages his speaking and develops his products, including books, DVDs, CDs of gospel music, and promotes his keynote speeches. He has authored four books to date on topics ranging from leadership to self-empowerment including Leadership is Common Sense and CEO of Self.

In 1996, Cain became CEO and President of the National Restaurant Association. He had been a member of the NRA Board since 1988, and had served as its elected volunteer chairman in 1994/1995. Cain thus became the only volunteer chairman to become the full-time CEO and President of the Association while still a member of the Board.

Isn't he the pizza shop guy?

 

Yeah, he's that sort of private-sector-business-experience guy that was proven so valuable a commodity in someone elected to run the government...

... proven by those oilmen GW Bush and Dick Cheney!

     
 
 
Best question here is...

...when did Hypochondriac Jeny stop hating Black People???        
 
 
 
 
 
LOL...keep thinking that

There isn't a Republican that has beaten him yet

Still waiting for the stiff the GOP will sacrifice this time

 

He's a likeable guy that's all he has going for him. He is losing those who helped him win the 2008 election. You can continue to believe as you do, but it will not change a thing if the election was right now he would lose.

OH why are the democrats running as far away from obama as possible? Why did the clintons shun obama and the wedding? And do not believe that BS about taking away from their daughter. They didn't even send him and invite to the reception. It may have been a shun but then it might have been fear of the wedding gift. obama has a bad history on giving gifts.

 

If the election were to be held right now, the Republicans wouldn't have a candidate who could run against him. They are still disorganized, in-fighting and looking for a leader.....Any Leader

The Republicans are a mess

 

Im not sure how it is you manage to make dumber posts near every time you post but, really RW? You do realize that the Republican primaries have not even started right? Of course there is no clear leader Who the fuck is the leader of the Democrat party? Obama? Obama, the guy that is already starting him campaign on damage control trying to get some kind of footing on a base that is crumbling?

Fact is the Republican party hated McCain and Obama only beat him goodly. Obama is going into an election vastly less popular than he was before even people that like Obama are not happy with him, they just really hate Republicans, like you

If the election were tomorrow yes, Obama would win because there is no 1 guy on the Republican side with enough name recognition being the primaries have not even started.

Heres a though for you RW, if the elections were held today, yet no one knew who was running for either side for the Dems or the Reps the vote would almost be split 50/50 Now if People knew Obama were the guy for the Dems and there were still an unnamed Republican the vote would be around 55/45 for Dems You seem to try and make it sound like Obama is going to win something like 78% of the vote because Republicans dont have a leader when reality is all a Dem or Republican has to do is excite their base and give independents a reason to vote for them and they win. Currently, Obama is struggling with just figure what his base is So lets give it A FUCKING YEAR to see where things end up ok?

RW, its not Republicans running for president that are underwhelming, its your opinion in general that is underwhelming and predictable.

Now get out there and vote for the wars supporting, war expanding, war starting, Bush tax cut passing, torture happy, homeland security expanding, rich guy bail-out loving President we all have come to know as Obama!
 
 
Him running will really show you how racist the right really is.

Him goind well in W. Virginia? Mississippi? REally? Ok...run this man, I cant wait.

He is the rights token black candidate. You can tell because no republican will vote for him.
 
 
Herman Cain: if pizza is a major campaign issue, he has a chance. Otherwise, he knows nothing. Some concerns:

He is an ignoramus on foreign policy issues such as Israel -- Right of return?  and he admitted he has no idea what to do about the war in Afghanistan.
He was hollering in May about making people reread the Constitution, and then proceeded to reel off quotes from the Constitution, which are actually from the Declaration of Independence. Later he started hollering about who, under the Constitution, controls bankruptcy laws, and got it completely wrong. Thus endeth the history lesson.
He wants to cut corporate tax rates, return to the gold standard, reform Social Security, ban abortion, repeal Obamacare, ban same-sex marriage, and impose the suicidally impractical Fair Tax.
He wont appoint a Muslim to high office because Muslims allegedly want to impose sharia law, although he is now parsing his statement
He called Planned Parenthood a planned genocideto kill black babies.
He is 65 and has already battled advanced cancer.
It is difficult to see how the GOP is going to pivot from years of race-baiting, to backing a black pizza guy. It would require an entire change in mentality and strategy. And against Cain, Obama could put some of the south in play.

So, yes, nominate him please! Not only will he be crushed in 2012, he will actually put the deep South back in play.

LOL. There is a extreme right wing faction of the Republican Party that is determined to never again have a black President of the United States of America. They don't like BHO...what makes you think they'll stomach another, just because he has a -R, after his name? Herman Cain is a fool, and an "Uncle Tom" of the first magnitude. If you think Pawlenty, Romney or Palin are going to sit idly by, and let him get the nomination by default, then you have underestimated them. I'll bet you money.

oh please there is plenty. One can even skip the Token black card and still have something to say.

He is basically telling you what you want to hear. He is playing to a very select crowd of people. He wont win Independents nor the left. He says far to radical things( see Wont elect a muslim to hold a Government position)
He is playing to the Fox news,Hannity, Rush, Beck, Palin crowd who eats this shit up.

at best he knows he wont win but this will get his name out there and therefore speaking gigs. Which in turn gets him more money. Which is why a lot of people run. To make money.i doubt he will win,but he sure will win at the wallet.

See not even a hint about him being the token black.

Just what we need on this board, another fucking racist.
 
 
 
 
Yep, love him...we have a couple 3 threads on him already.  

He was proclaimed as a self hating black here.

 

Yeah they tried that shit when he ran for office a few years back. It didn't stick.

He didn't win--only reason was he was running against the incumbent, Johnny Isakson (a true dickhead and dirtbag, I know him personally, almost bought a house from him. He's a shyster).

Had Herman run against someone else, he actually might have won. He's got a LOT of support here in GA.

He's got mine. I was leaning towards Palin, but I'd love to see a Cain/Palin ticket. That would make my day. Cain President, Palin VP.

 

That's sexist......(just kidding)

Palin has more executive experience.

I think Palin needs to be in there somewhere.

Imagine a White House with Mitt Romney, Sarah Palin, Herman Cain, and Newt Gingrich in it in various capacities.

Talking about sweeping out corruption and a new era of White House efficiency.

The part that reall kills DUmbDonkeys ass is that this Colored Republican is a SELF MADE MILLIONAIRE..              
 
 
 
 
 
He is the rights token black candidate. You can tell because no republican will vote for him.

 

LOL, the race card... Played when you got nothin.

 

oh please there is plenty. One can even skip the Token black card and still have something to say.

He is basically telling you what you want to hear. He is playing to a very select crowd of people. He wont win Independents nor the left. He says far to radical things( see Wont elect a muslim to hold a Government position)
He is playing to the Fox news,Hannity, Rush, Beck, Palin crowd who eats this shit up.

at best he knows he wont win but this will get his name out there and therefore speaking gigs. Which in turn gets him more money. Which is why a lot of people run. To make money.i doubt he will win,but he sure will win at the wallet.

See not even a hint about him being the token black.

 

I'm not a HC fan but you noobs need to check your racist BS before you come in here IMO. If HC is a token Black guy then so is Obama, it's that simple and there is no way to debate your way out of that hole.

how so? there have been numerous black elected officials in the dem party.then one could point to Al sharpton and Jackson( admittly sadly) as they have run for higher office.
And i am sorry the left doesnt have the stink of racism. No please dont go the kkk route and how southern dems where for slavery. Different time, different definition. We had a massive swing where those went to the right and no longer where "democrats". That ship has sailed a long time ago. Otherwise they would still have stayed as dems and not switched over.

Now did some vote for obama because he was black? yes, but then if we are to admit that then we have to admit they're racists in the tea party/Gop.

the only thing the GOP has is this reverse racism nonsense they have been trying to push as a deflection from what they have been saying.

I couldn't even read your whole post. You sound like such a dumb fucking ape. Give it up man, sure part of the Republican party is racist but so is a small part of the Democrat and independents and every other party out there.

Dumb shits like RW in this thread claim ALL Republicans are racist, are you really gonna defend useless bigoted people like that?

He is basically telling you what you want to hear. He is playing to a very select crowd of people. He wont win Independents nor the left. He says far to radical things( see Wont elect a muslim to hold a Government position)
He is playing to the Fox news,Hannity, Rush, Beck, Palin crowd who eats this shit up.

at best he knows he wont win but this will get his name out there and therefore speaking gigs. Which in turn gets him more money. Which is why a lot of people run. To make money.i doubt he will win,but he sure will win at the wallet.

See not even a hint about him being the token black.

 

I'm not a HC fan but you noobs need to check your racist BS before you come in here IMO. If HC is a token Black guy then so is Obama, it's that simple and there is no way to debate your way out of that hole.

 

how so? there have been numerous black elected officials in the dem party.then one could point to Al sharpton and Jackson( admittly sadly) as they have run for higher office.
And i am sorry the left doesnt have the stink of racism. No please dont go the kkk route and how southern dems where for slavery. Different time, different definition. We had a massive swing where those went to the right and no longer where "democrats". That ship has sailed a long time ago. Otherwise they would still have stayed as dems and not switched over.

Now did some vote for obama because he was black? yes, but then if we are to admit that then we have to admit they're racists in the tea party/Gop.

the only thing the GOP has is this reverse racism nonsense they have been trying to push as a deflection from what they have been saying.

 

So you're telling us that LBJ was on the right?
Personally I have listened to Mr Cain and dismissed him, He would get my vote over Obama but i wouldn't vote for him in the Primary. And fuck all you racist assholes; it has nothing to do with color. (for the hundredth time)

I couldn't even read your whole post. You sound like such a dumb fucking ape. Give it up man, sure part of the Republican party is racist but so is a small part of the Democrat and independents and every other party out there.

Dumb shits like RW in this thread claim ALL Republicans are racist, are you really gonna defend useless bigoted people like that?

 

so you just wanted to insult me to insult me, because its seems you were able to read what i said. ive come to expect very little of you,and you didnt disappoint.

sure some in the dems are racist but you dont see them, nor are they stereotyped as such. Unlike The GOP/teaparty who have time and time again.

I am not defending anyone. My argument has no basis on what RW is saying. I am calling it like i see it. I came to my conclusions about the TP long before anyone else.

LBJ is irrelevant to todays world. we are talking the past 10-15 years here.

Just because YOU personally may not be a racist does not mean your status represents the whole tea party.

You would think people would understand this.
 
 
 
 
 
LOL. There is a extreme right wing faction of the Republican Party that is determined to never again have a black President of the United States of America. They don't like BHO...what makes you think they'll stomach another, just because he has a -R, after his name? Herman Cain is a fool, and an "Uncle Tom" of the first magnitude. If you think Pawlenty, Romney or Palin are going to sit idly by, and let him get the nomination by default, then you have underestimated them. I'll bet you money.

 

How many times do Republicans have to tell you that skin color is not important CHARACTER is. It's Democrats that constantly make race an issue.

 

The part that reall kills DUmbDonkeys ass is that this Colored Republican is a SELF MADE MILLIONAIRE..              

 

Kind of like Oprah, only he doesn't worship Obama.

Ah, so 20 years ago the Democrats may have been racist but not 15 years ago and not today....
BS

And while I agree with much of what the Tea Party stands for I am not a member.

The point is the left almost always brings up race first. Why is that?
 
 
 
 
Yep, love him...we have a couple 3 threads on him already.  

He was proclaimed as a self hating black here.

 

Yeah they tried that shit when he ran for office a few years back. It didn't stick.

He didn't win--only reason was he was running against the incumbent, Johnny Isakson (a true dickhead and dirtbag, I know him personally, almost bought a house from him. He's a shyster).

Had Herman run against someone else, he actually might have won. He's got a LOT of support here in GA.

He's got mine. I was leaning towards Palin, but I'd love to see a Cain/Palin ticket. That would make my day. Cain President, Palin VP.

 

I know Herman Cain and Johnny Isaakson and voted for Herman when he ran against Isaakson. Obviously I would have liked it if Herman had won but Isaakson has voted in the Senate the way Herman would have most, if not all of the time.
 
 
 
Herman Cain: if pizza is a major campaign issue, he has a chance. Otherwise, he knows nothing. Some concerns:

He is an ignoramus on foreign policy issues such as Israel -- Right of return?  and he admitted he has no idea what to do about the war in Afghanistan.
He was hollering in May about making people reread the Constitution, and then proceeded to reel off quotes from the Constitution, which are actually from the Declaration of Independence. Later he started hollering about who, under the Constitution, controls bankruptcy laws, and got it completely wrong. Thus endeth the history lesson.
He wants to cut corporate tax rates, return to the gold standard, reform Social Security, ban abortion, repeal Obamacare, ban same-sex marriage, and impose the suicidally impractical Fair Tax.
He wont appoint a Muslim to high office because Muslims allegedly want to impose sharia law, although he is now parsing his statement
He called Planned Parenthood a planned genocideto kill black babies.
He is 65 and has already battled advanced cancer.
It is difficult to see how the GOP is going to pivot from years of race-baiting, to backing a black pizza guy. It would require an entire change in mentality and strategy. And against Cain, Obama could put some of the south in play.

So, yes, nominate him please! Not only will he be crushed in 2012, he will actually put the deep South back in play.

 

Have you tasted Godfathers pizza?

He does deserve credit for getting people to eat that shit
 
 
 
The point is the left almost always brings up race first. Why is that?

 

 

In this thread alone that started about 10 months ago, the first 5 people to bring up his race were all people who are on the right side of the political spectrum. Including the OP. I haven't looked beyond that but I doubt the story is any different.

Whenever I see a thread on Cain, the same two things occur:

His business experience is brought up, and the right cannot help but throw his race gleefully in the face of anyone who will listen as an example of how Liberals are supposedly racist or going to be racist. Liberals are guilty of the precrime of being racist against Cain if you bother to listen to some of the ramblings.

Of course, at the end of the day, Conservatives won't actually vote for Cain.
 
 
 
 
 
Him running will really show you how racist the right really is.

Him goind well in W. Virginia? Mississippi? REally? Ok...run this man, I cant wait.

 

He is the rights token black candidate. You can tell because no republican will vote for him.

 

LOL, the race card... Played when you got nothin.

 

Then let's see Republicans vote for him

The proof is in the polls
 
 
 
 
The left will brand him the first black racist.

 

hes already been called a "self hating black/uncle tom" on this board

 

What difference does it make what the left think?

Nope, how can you vote for a person who can't keep the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution straight. Like I said I'll vote for him over Obama but I think just about anyone would do as good as Obama, and probably better.
 
 
There's a lot of things Herman has done that tarnish his image. For example, he supported TARP and called anyone who didn't support TARP as "purists."
 
 
A black republican will never go far. There are far to many racists in that party to actually have him run for president. If you think I am wrong, please respond to this..

Tell me Cain will do well with republicans in:
W. Virginia
Mississippi
Alabama
Texas
etc etc

That is the difference between our parties. We can back, support and encourage a qualified black candidate. Just like we would have supported Hillary if she beat Obama. The republicans will only support older white males. Period. This is why they will lose in 2012.

Nope, how can you vote for a person who can't keep the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution straight. Like I said I'll vote for him over Obama but I think just about anyone would do as good as Obama, and probably better.

 

Are you talking about John Boehner who is the current head of the GOP in the House? Furthermore, Cain will not poll more than 5-10% as I previously mentioned today:

 
The majority of the time I see Cain being mentioned on this board it's either:

A.) He's a successful businessman.

B.) Used to beat Liberals over the head with imaginary racism arguments.

As Polk said, when the rubber meets the road, the majority of Conservatives will not vote for Cain.

As I detail why here:

 
 
Be fearful of CoCain arrogant liberal. He will knock Obama's socks off and the Obama crowd won't be able to use their solo weapon, the race card!

 

You're assuming he'd win the nomination.

Do you know Cain doesn't support an audit of the Federal Reserve?

 YouTube - No Need To Audit the Federal Reserve According to Herman Cain 
  YouTube - No Need To Audit the Federal Reserve According to Herman Cain 

That will make him lose a segment of the Republican Party.

The fact he's African American will also make him lose a smaller segment of the GOP who are still stuck in the 1950's.

He's also a supporter of the Gold Standard which will lose him some votes. He also opposes Abortion, even in the case of rape and incest.

He's also willing to discriminate against Muslims and not allow them into his cabinet. Between his views on Abortion and this, he'll lose a good portion of the moderate vote in the GOP.

In a field where he would come off as just another Social Conservative Republican who panders to the base, nothing stands out about him as a candidate. In that case, those with the largest name power will have the advantage.

 

Anyone who is willing to vote for Cain is more likely to vote for either Mitt Romney or Ron Paul first. Especially since those same people likely supported either candidate in 2008.

 

 
Let's go down the line as to why Cain won't win the GOP nomination, shall we?

Cain supported the TARP bailouts (though Paul Ryan did too) and still does:

 Political positions of Herman Cain - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 
Cain supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bank bailouts as a way to save the economy, viewing it as an investment opportunity for the taxpayers. In a 2008 editorial, Cain wrote, "Owning a part of the major banks in America is not a bad thing. We could make a profit while solving a problem."[1] In May 2011, regarding his TARP support, Cain said "I dont have any regrets... I studied the situation. I didnt have trouble with the idea; I had trouble with its implementation, picking winners and losers."[2]

 

Supporting TARP and a bailout in general is not popular within the GOP currently.

He doesn't believe there is a need to audit the federal reserve and believes in returning to the Gold Standard as previously mentioned. This will lose him some votes, especially those who are deciding between him and Ron Paul.

He calls Social Security a scam and wants to reform the system using "free market solutions". That will lose him some votes with older voters.

He opposes Abortion in all cases as previously mentioned and also wants to ban Gay Marriage through DOMA on a federal level. Clearly a Conservative who has no problem using the power of Big Government to circumvent states rights when he feels necessary.

As for foreign policy, he is no different in his position than the majority of other candidates. Supports Israel, opposes the New Start treaty, doesn't like Iran or North Korea, etc.

He supports Paul Ryan's budget plan which will lose him more votes, especially with the older demographic.

As previously mentioned, he says he would feel uncomfortable with appointing a Muslim to a federal position. This will drive away moderates.

Conclusion: As previously stated, in a field where star power helps, Cain is no different for the most part from your average run-of-the-mill social Conservative. What sets him apart from most of the field is his business experience. However, in a field that has Mitt Romney, this will lose some of its luster. I would be surprised if he ends up polling more than 5% in the primaries, and I would be definitely surprised if he polls more than 10%.

LOL. There is a extreme right wing faction of the Republican Party that is determined to never again have a black President of the United States of America. They don't like BHO...what makes you think they'll stomach another, just because he has a -R, after his name? Herman Cain is a fool, and an "Uncle Tom" of the first magnitude. If you think Pawlenty, Romney or Palin are going to sit idly by, and let him get the nomination by default, then you have underestimated them. I'll bet you money.

 

Just what we need on this board, another fucking racist.

 

Excuse me, but I'm no racist...and one can't be racist against one's own race...however, one can be a race traitor..and that is exactly what Herman Cain is...a conservative white apologist.

So you're telling us that LBJ was on the right?
Personally I have listened to Mr Cain and dismissed him, He would get my vote over Obama but i wouldn't vote for him in the Primary. And fuck all you racist assholes; it has nothing to do with color. (for the hundredth time)

 

LBJ is irrelevant to todays world. we are talking the past 10-15 years here.

Just because YOU personally may not be a racist does not mean your status represents the whole tea party.

BS

And while I agree with much of what the Tea Party stands for I am not a member.

The point is the left almost always brings up race first. Why is that?

 

well no, thats not true. I am just limiting myself to 10-15 years.

you are the worst kind of a racist, the very worst kind.
 
 
Cain /McCain, same difference as far as I'm concerned. I don't know that much about the guy. It did fairly well in the first GOP debate. Although, that's not really saying much. Right now the republican field is wide open. It's too soon to tell who will eventually win the nomination. I think Cain is tied for second place with Palin in the polls. Whether he's actually nominee material is up to the right. In a general election up against Obama he's not polling very well. But, again, it's too soon to tell.

I'm not a HC fan but you noobs need to check your racist BS before you come in here IMO. If HC is a token Black guy then so is Obama, it's that simple and there is no way to debate your way out of that hole.

 

how so? there have been numerous black elected officials in the dem party.then one could point to Al sharpton and Jackson( admittly sadly) as they have run for higher office.
And i am sorry the left doesnt have the stink of racism. No please dont go the kkk route and how southern dems where for slavery. Different time, different definition. We had a massive swing where those went to the right and no longer where "democrats". That ship has sailed a long time ago. Otherwise they would still have stayed as dems and not switched over.

Now did some vote for obama because he was black? yes, but then if we are to admit that then we have to admit they're racists in the tea party/Gop.

the only thing the GOP has is this reverse racism nonsense they have been trying to push as a deflection from what they have been saying.

 

Look at facts, guy! Roughly 52 of whites voted for McCain, but 98% of blacks voted for obama. Who's more racist?

That's your "evidence" of racism?

95% of Blacks voted for Bill Clinton too. And Gore. And Kerry.

Could it be that Blacks are predominately Democrat, rather than "just voting for Obama because he's Black"?
 
 
 
A black republican will never go far. There are far to many racists in that party to actually have him run for president. If you think I am wrong, please respond to this..

Tell me Cain will do well with republicans in:
W. Virginia
Mississippi
Alabama
Texas
etc etc

That is the difference between our parties. We can back, support and encourage a qualified black candidate. Just like we would have supported Hillary if she beat Obama. The republicans will only support older white males. Period. This is why they will lose in 2012.

 

Everyone I talk to about Cain here in Alabama likes him. The majority place him first in their preferences.
But, there you go stereotyping southerners.There is less racism here in Alabama than there is in Connecticut where I grew up.
Down here blacks dip snuff, drive Ford pick-ups and wear bib overalls just like everyone else. I rarely notice the difference 'cept at night.  
 
 
 
 
 
LOL. There is a extreme right wing faction of the Republican Party that is determined to never again have a black President of the United States of America. They don't like BHO...what makes you think they'll stomach another, just because he has a -R, after his name? Herman Cain is a fool, and an "Uncle Tom" of the first magnitude. If you think Pawlenty, Romney or Palin are going to sit idly by, and let him get the nomination by default, then you have underestimated them. I'll bet you money.

 

How many times do Republicans have to tell you that skin color is not important CHARACTER is. It's Democrats that constantly make race an issue.

 

LOL. Tell that to any tea partier. LOL

 

Have you ever actually been to a TEA Party gathering or are you relying on what you hear on BET?
Every gathering I've been to, people have gone out of their way to welcome and encourage the black people who are in attendance.
At one rally in Fort Lauderdale, I was standing at the curb with a black man in his 30's. We were talking about taxes, Personal responsibility and the constitutionality of obama care when one member of a group of black youths in a passing car threw a bottle of beer, hitting him in the chest, while shouting "race traitor"

And we're racist???

Why would you need to go out of your way to encourage black people in attendance?
Why not just treat them like everybody else?
Why is the race of the guys in the car relevant?
Why are you bringing up BET? Have you seen a program
where they discourage attendance at Tea Party rallies?
Is it your contention that only black oriented shows
are critical of the Tea Party movement?
Same question to you.

Have you ever actually watched BET?
 
 
BTW, I have a feeling you just made that story up about
people throwing beer bottles.
 
 
 
There's a lot of things Herman has done that tarnish his image. For example, he supported TARP and called anyone who didn't support TARP as "purists."

 

There was nothing wrong with TARP. It was the total lack of oversight and rules for that bailout that was the problem. That, and the fact that they didn't have to eat any shit at all. Goldman-Sachs got 100 cents on the dollar for their bad paper. AIG had no checks on their bailout money. That was all Paulson (the ex-CEO of Goldman-Sachs), and Bush.

The money that Obama negotiated to save Chrysler and GM was structured, regulated, had conditions applied (among them, the removal of the CEO and other top executives), and had a built in profit for the taxpayers upon re-payment.
 
 
 
 
 
well no, thats not true. I am just limiting myself to 10-15 years.

An the point is the left doesnt bring up race the most. That ship sailed long ago.

 

Really? I don't know how much of this site's quotes are true, I didn't verify them. But they are interesting, And I know that many of them are accurate.

Racism sucks no matter which side or color it comes from.

 

so you dont know if they are true but you go ahead and believe them anyways? Yeah hackey.
I've already said the left has some racist tones to them, but the GOP has the overall stereotype period.

 

Truthiness.

Just what we need on this board, another fucking racist.

 

Excuse me, but I'm no racist...and one can't be racist against one's own race...however, one can be a race traitor..and that is exactly what Herman Cain is...a conservative white apologist.

 

With all due respect, that does sound racist. Because Cain's values lie with a more conservative view than most Black's does not equate to a "conservative white apologist."

If Cain could convince Americans to buy his crappy tasting pizza, he may be able to convince Americans to buy the line of shit he is selling now

Sharia Law?
