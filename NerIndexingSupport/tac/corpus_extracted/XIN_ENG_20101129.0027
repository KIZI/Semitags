RAMALLAH, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians Monday marked the 63rd
anniversary of the UN partition plan, calling for the implementation of
international resolutions that lead to the establishment of their independent
state.

The Ramallah-based Palestinian Ministry of Information said in a statement sent
to reporters that the decision (partition plan) " was a dangerous turning point
that kept the Palestinians paying heavy prices."

"The UN General Assembly decision in 1977 to make Nov. 29 the International Day
of Solidarity with the Palestinian People has to be truly interpreted by
implementing the international resolutions, mainly the ones related to the
refugees' right to return and compensation," said the statement.

The Ministry of Information also called on the UN Security Council and the
General Assembly "to end the longest military occupation in history and
interpret its related decision to the Palestinian cause by ending this
occupation and help the Palestinians gain their independence."

Meanwhile, Zakareya el-Agha, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) Executive Committee, called on the international community to stand by the
side of the Palestinian people and support their legal struggle to gain their
rights.

He called on the UN Security Council "to be fair with the Palestinian people,
end the injustice and enable our people to establish their independent state,"
adding "Israel has to be pressured to respect the international legitimacy and
implement the resolutions 181 and 194."

The PLO is still sticking to achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the
region, el-Agha said.

The Hamas movement said the partition plan "is legally invalid because it
automatically dropped at the end of the World War II, although it was issued by
an international organization."

"The land of Palestine is a complete geographical unit from the Dead Sea to the
River of Jordan. It is a part of the Arab world and the Islamic nations and can
never be divided," the Hamas said in a statement emailed to reporters.

It added that "although 63 years had passed, the Palestinians are still
rejecting this illegal and unaccepted decision."

The less influential Islamic Jihad (Holy War) movement said in a press statement
that "the land of Palestine can never be divided. "

"The Palestinians have the right to resist until they fully achieve their legal
demands, mainly ending the military occupation of their lands," said the
statement.

Meanwhile, the Palestinian left-wing groups, mainly the Popular Front to
Liberate Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian Struggle Front (PSF), called on
the international community and the UN Security Council "to immediately
recognize an independent state for the Palestinian people."

The left-wing groups considered the International Day of Solidarity with
Palestinian People a day "that represents a test to the courage and ability of
the international community to work on bringing the lost legitimate rights of
the Palestinian people and end the occupation and settlement."

The UN General Assembly passed on Nov. 29, 1947 the partition plan on historic
Palestine and divided it in two states, one for the Palestinians and one for the
Jews. The decision ended the British mandate on historic Palestine while
stipulating Jerusalem and Bethlehem are under international custody.

This decision, officially called UN resolution 181, was the first international
attempt to end the Arab-Jewish conflict on the land of historic Palestine.
