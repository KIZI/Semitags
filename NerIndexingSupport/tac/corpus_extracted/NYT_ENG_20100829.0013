The atmosphere at Cafe Racer, a coffeehouse and bar in
the University District here, skews distinctly postgrunge, with its
scuffed floor and mismatched furniture, its thrift-store paintings
on boldly colored walls. One Sunday evening this spring the place
was packed mainly with teenagers and 20-somethings in T-shirts and
sneakers, all listening intently to a band. Everything seemed of a
piece except the music: sleek, dynamic large-group jazz, a whirl of
dark-hued harmony and billowing rhythm.

"Split Stream" was the name of the composition, by Andy
Clausen, an industrious young trombonist. Most of the players in
his 10-piece band, crowding one end of the room, were his
classmates at Roosevelt High School. A few others hailed from
Garfield High School, which like Roosevelt is a reliable favorite
in Jazz at Lincoln Center's prestigious Essentially Ellington High
School Jazz Band Competition. The intelligent sheen of Clausen's
writing was as striking as the composure of his peers, notably the
trumpeter Riley Mulherkar, then a Garfield senior. It was
impressive, and not just by the yardstick of their age.

Seattle, a city synonymous with alternative rock, has long
sustained a provincial jazz culture, without much fuss or a
signature sound. To outside jazz partisans the city is known as an
incubator for high school talent that usually flies the coop,
heading East for conservatory training and professional careers.
Clausen and Mulherkar are both arriving in New York this week to
begin their first semester at the Juilliard Institute for Jazz
Studies, which highlights both the lofty promise and a lingering
problem of their hometown.

But the landscape has been shifting because of recent events at
the university level and at joints like Cafe Racer, home to a
musician-run series called the Racer Sessions. A growing number of
young musicians have been focused on building an autonomous scene,
something distinctive and homegrown. The acclaimed trumpeter Cuong
Vu, who left Seattle in the late 1980s and recently made his way
back, said he was reminded of the energy of New York's 1990s
downtown scene, the tail end of which he experienced firsthand.
"Seattle could be a model for all the other places in the U.S.
that need a scene like this," he said.

Vu is by no means an objective observer. A few years ago he
joined the faculty of the University of Washington's School of
Music, where he has worked closely with a number of players,
bringing an ultramodern ethos to a fairly traditional program. He
might be overstating the case, but he could also be on to
something.

"I was very, very close to staying here," Clausen said after
his group had yielded the floor to a series of improvised
responses, according to Racer Sessions protocol. "It was a tough
decision, because I'm excited about what's happening. There's all
this momentum here now. It's a really exciting place to be."

The history of jazz in most American cities is a tale of ebb and
flow, and Seattle fits the bill. In his 1993 book, "Jackson Street
After Hours: The Roots of Jazz in Seattle," Paul de Barros
recounts a nightclub boom that ran from the late '30s into the
'50s, cultivating regional heroes like the trumpeter and
saxophonist Floyd Standifer.

The low ebb, according to the jazz radio host Jim Wilke, came in
the '60s, with the rise of rock 'n' roll. Musicians were still
playing jazz, but mainly along the margins. That ended up suiting
people like the guitarist Bill Frisell and the keyboardist Wayne
Horvitz, two of the most prominent jazz artists to call Seattle
home.

"When I moved here from New York in 1989, I wasn't looking to
be in any kind of a scene," Frisell said. "I was kind of looking
for a place to hide out." (Still, his album "Beautiful
Dreamers," due out on Savoy on Tuesday, features another adopted
Seattleite, the violist Eyvind Kang.)

Since the 1990s, which saw an underground jazz boomlet parallel
to the rise of grunge (Horvitz was a fixture of the OK Hotel, which
had also been a home to Nirvana), the city has developed a civic
pride about jazz that few others can rival. "Seattle has a value
system around jazz," said John Gilbreath, executive director of
Earshot Jazz, which will present the 22nd Earshot Jazz Festival
this fall. "It's part of the cultural expectation. There's an
independent-jazz ecology here, it's factionalized, but all the
factions are in harmony. And it's self-renewing in this really
wonderful way."

That self-renewal comes from boomerang musicians like the
trumpeter Thomas Marriott and the drummer Matt Jorgensen, who
headed East but eventually returned. Along with peers like the
saxophonist Mark Taylor, they are now stalwarts of the jazz
mainstream here, working at places like the New Orleans Creole
Restaurant and Tula's Jazz Club. And their music has a strong
outlet in Origin Records, a Seattle label with worldwide
distribution, and an impressive track record on national jazz
radio. Jorgensen runs Origin with its founder, the drummer John
Bishop; together they also started the Ballard Jazz Festival,
featuring area artists almost exclusively.

Jazz also has a presence at Benaroya Hall, home of the Seattle
Symphony. The Seattle Repertory Jazz Orchestra performs there, to a
loyal patronage. "They're folks who would otherwise have
subscribed to the chamber orchestra or the symphony," said the
saxophonist Michael Brockman, one of the orchestra's artistic
directors and a longtime University of Washington faculty member.
"That's 80 percent of our audience, and they rarely if ever go to
a jazz club."

What galvanizes Seattle jazz audiences more than anything is the
diligent effort of its teenage musicians. "The big-band programs
here are kind of like high school football in Texas," Jorgensen
said.

The chief catalyst is the Essentially Ellington contest, which
began in 1995. Over the last decade Garfield and Roosevelt have won
first place a combined seven times. "The bands have different
philosophies," said Wynton Marsalis, Jazz at Lincoln Center's
artistic director and the avuncular soul of the competition. "In
general Garfield's band has strong soloists, and Roosevelt has
really good ensembles."

A glimpse into rehearsals by both bands in April, a month before
the contest, illuminated the difference. Clarence Acox, who came to
Garfield from New Orleans in 1971, led the Garfield band with an
offhand but booming authority. "Stay right there," he growled at
his drummer, indicating a rhythmic pocket, during "Launching
Pad," a 12-bar blues.

At Roosevelt, Scott Brown exuded a warmer and more technical
air, often tinkering with the mechanics of a phrase. (Interschool
rivalry aside, Brown, a trombonist, plays alongside Acox in the
Seattle Repertory Jazz Orchestra.) Between takes his students were
a fount of wisecracks, but at each downbeat they snapped into gear.
For "After All" Clausen took the lead against a purr of
saxophones.

The band directors aren't the only reason for the schools' track
record. "Both Garfield and Roosevelt are public schools, but the
support is akin to a private institution, in terms of what the
parents do," said the trumpeter Tatum Greenblatt, a graduate of
Garfield and Juilliard, who lives in New York. Parent groups raise
money to send the bands to competitions and on tour in Europe; the
first Garfield jazz fundraiser, in 1990, organized by Marriott's
parents, earned about $80,000.

The other secret weapon has been the jazz program at Washington
Middle School that until two years ago was led by Robert Knatt, who
is now retired. "People would come into ninth grade already
knowing how to read music and play in a section and improvise,"
Greenblatt said.

Ask young Seattle jazz musicians what's new about the scene, and
they are likely to point to Vu. By all accounts he has galvanized
his students, charging them with a radical sense of purpose and
advocating on their behalf. He invited some -- like the bassist Luke
Bergman and the drummer Chris Icasiano, both now alumni and key
figures in the Racer Sessions -- to be in his new band, Speak, which
recently released its self-titled debut on Origin. Vu also advises
the Improvised Music Project, a coalition of students and alumni,
which held its second annual festival this spring.

"This really is a marker of a new phase," Richard Karpen, the
new director of the University of Washington's School of Music,
said in April at a 20th-anniversary celebration for its Jazz
Studies program. Karpen, a composer, said jazz is now a greater
priority for the program.

As part of the festivities Vu played three concerts with his Vu
Tet. On the first night the crowd was full of students, including
Carmen Rothwell, a bassist in the Garfield band. "A few days ago I
decided that I'm coming to U.W. to major in Jazz Studies," she
said. "I really, really like the direction that it's going in."

The University of Washington isn't the only Seattle educational
institution in the process of rejuvenation. The Cornish College of
the Arts, which has a history of avant-gardism stretching to John
Cage in the '30s, recently hired a new department chairman, Kent
Devereaux. He said his decision to take the job had been influenced
by the five teaching positions that will be turning over in the
next five years, enabling him to put his stamp on the faculty.

Cornish has also stepped up its recruiting, begun a capital
campaign for a larger new building and, for the first time,
acquired dormitory space. As a result, Devereaux said, "I went
from a program where last year it was 83 percent Washingtonians to
one where my incoming class is only 46 percent."

Applications have risen by roughly a third in each of the last
two years, and the college has started a high school summer jazz
program. "We weren't connecting to the community," he said.

These changes at the college level should benefit Seatle's jazz
scene at large. But such abstractions were far from anyone's mind
in May, as the Garfield and Roosevelt bands, and 13 others from
across the country, descended on Frederick P. Rose Hall in
Manhattan for Essentially Ellington. Each band performed and then
waited for the announcement of the three finalists.

Mulherkar almost missed that moment, because he had to slip away
for his Juilliard audition. But he returned in time, with news that
he had been accepted. Then came word that Garfield was one of the
final three and would perform that night with Marsalis. Roosevelt
just missed the cut, earning an honorable mention nod.

A few hours later Mulherkar went toe to toe with Marsalis at
Avery Fisher Hall, trading soulful barbs and plunger-muted whinnies
on "The Shepherd." In essence he was sparring with the world's
most celebrated jazz trumpeter, and he held his own, earning stagy
glares from Marsalis, vicarious hollers from the hall and
ultimately a standing ovation.

There were more cheers for the results: Garfield had won the
Essentially Ellington competition, for the second year in a row.
And Mulherkar received the Ella Fitzgerald Outstanding Soloist
Award, its highest individual honor. "We even heard some things
we'd never heard done before on our instrument," Marsalis said of
Mulherkar. (Clausen won the award for outstanding trombone.)

Speaking by phone recently, Mulherkar focused squarely on the
transition ahead. But he did say he'd miss Seattle and its nascent
scene. "I was actually just talking to my brother, who's at the
New England Conservatory now," he said. "He was saying how lucky
my peer group was because he didn't have anything like that when he
was in high school."

As for Clausen, he played a farewell show at Cafe Racer last
weekend, with Speak and four of his other bands. "Summer has been
really productive," he wrote in an e-mail. "Completed a two-week
European tour with the Roosevelt Jazz Band, finished recording two
new bands of my own, and a group of us from the Racer Sessions are
forming a new record label/music foundation to present, share and
promote our music. Leaving is bittersweet."
