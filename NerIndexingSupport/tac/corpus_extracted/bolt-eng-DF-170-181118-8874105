 Obama apology aimed to support

President Obama was worried about the safety of American troops and civilian workers in Afghanistan when he apologized to that country's president, Hamid Karzai, over the burning of Qurans at the largest US military base there, the White House said Friday.

"The president believed it was in the best interest of their safety to make it clear that an apology was appropriate, and that the American people -- and the American military, in particular -- does have respect for the religious views and the religious practices of the Afghan people," spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.

 

I just find it odd that we are in the middle of a war and somehow the president thinks an apology is the way to keep our military troops safe.
Enemy combatants are a danger to our troops, dead enemies are not dangerous. Apologizing to an enemy is not going to reduce his intent to kill you.
Wars are won by completely destroying an enemies will and ability to wage war, not by apologizing.
 
 
 An open letter to The People of Afganistan.

Besides, our guys did NOTHING wrong. There was no intent of malice and it was only a few copies.

The Afghanis should be thankful we have the guys with the highest skill levels pointing guns at them and the guys making the mistakes are the ones burning trash.
 
 
After the horrific 9/11 attacks, we weren't supposed to retaliate against the Muslim community based on the actions of individual terrorists...but now they feel justified to retaliate against our military based on what?? There is NO comparison...their blood did not run in our streets as an act of revenge, and the fact that they can't restrain themselves from murder, no matter how "offended" they are, is a fucking outrage. The administration should be demanding that Karzai talk his fucking people off the ledge.

The words "I got your back" isn't in obama's vocabulary. He apologized and then two American officers were killed. His apology was seen exactly as it was, a betrayal of his leadership.

Instead, our President feels it is necessary for him to apologize.

When was the last time you saw a bunch of (American) Christians rioting because somebody burned a desecrated bible?
I'm half tempted to buy a bunch of bibles and start a bonfire and call all the news outlets to film the act just to see how many Christians go on a with hunt to kill atheists afterwards.

I don't think it should make a difference if there was malicious intent but the fact that there wasn't just highlights the absurdity.

Had the burning not occurred, Americans would still be shot and killed by the enemy at every opportunity they had. It's a fucking war, you use every excuse to kill the enemy, apologizing doesn't change that.
 
 
Has Obama said ONE word to the American people after the soldiers were murdered? Why hasn't he? Why hasn't he condemned this? I keep hoping that MAYBE he's making plans to retaliate....but i doubt it!   He's such an embarassment!
 
 
Tomorrow he kisses the Koran on national tv to show "our" love and respect of their "holy book".

Well? You don't think that is possible?

Immie

It would shock me, but not really surprise me  
 
 
Ditto. I would be appalled but not really surprised.
 
 
This is what Liberalism gets you.

A racist Politically Correct President who won't defend his own country.
 
 
This was intentional.

The burning was intentionally made public. Obama never admits wrongdoing, ever.

He wanted this to happen so he could turn the people of Afghanistan against us, like he turned the Iraqis against us.

He's looking for a way out before the election.

It's not liberalism. That is a stupid, stupid label to be tossing in to this conversation.

It's poor leadership, plain and simple. Liberal or conservative ideology has little to do with it, sans our reasons for being there in the first place.

This, on the other hand, is quite relevant.

Obama was not what I was using as an example of liberalism.

The mentality that elects this type of cluster-fuck to office is my example.

It's Pie In The Sky ideology, look the other way Borg mentality, explain away any transgression, non-principled thinking that allowed a racist schmuck like Obama to be POTUS.

Wow now, the Iraqis and Afghans already hated Americans before we even set foot in their countries, the Iraqis already were pissed at us for bombing the shit out of them in the 90s and not helping them when they rose up against Saddam after the first Gulf War and we let them be slaughtered, plus the sanctions that made the average Iraqis lives miserable, they didn't forget that but alot of us have. As far as the Afghans, alot of them were taught firey anti American hatred in their madrassas, before we even went into that country, these people were not on our side before Obama stepped into the White House.
