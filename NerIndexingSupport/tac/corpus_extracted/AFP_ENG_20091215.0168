The next America's Cup will be held in Valencia in February, the Supreme Court
of the State of New York ruled on Tuesday.

The court was upholding an earlier decision that the next America's Cup should
be held in the Spanish port as desired by US team Oracle.

It rejected an appeal of that judgement filed by America's Cup holders Alinghi
of Switzerland which wanted the race to be held in Ras al-Khaimah in the United
Arab Emirates, according to a copy of the ruling obtained by AFP.
