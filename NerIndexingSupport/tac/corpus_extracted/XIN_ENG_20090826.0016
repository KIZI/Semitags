RAMALLAH, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- An unusual session for the Palestinian National
Council (PNC), the parliament of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was
held in Ramallah on Wednesday to select six members to fulfill the six vacant
posts in the 18- seat PLO executive committee.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who is also the PLO executive committee's
chairman and Fatah party chief, said when addressing some 300 PNC members at the
session that the six new members of the executive committee have been agreed
upon among the factions.

Abbas named Saeb Erekat and Ahmed Qureia from Fatah, Salih Ra' fat from the
Palestinian Democratic Party, Ahmed Majdalani from the Popular Struggle Front
(PSF), Ziad Abu Amro, independent and Hana Amira, Christian to fulfill the posts
in the committee that have been vacant for several years.

Erekat is a chief negotiator and was recently elected as member of Fatah party's
central committee, elected by the Fatah general conference held in the West Bank
in early August.

Qureia, who represents the old guards in the movement, was defeated before an
overwhelming support for the young guards.

"These names were agreed upon in previous preparatory meetings held between
active executive committee members and representatives of other factions
represented in the PLO," Abbas told the unusual session which is only for
selecting members for the vacant posts.

Abbas has also called for holding a full regular PNC session within the coming
months in accordance to the factions' understandings reached in Cairo in March
2005.

Abbas' bitter rival Hamas movement however rejected Wednesday's unusual PNC
session, saying it contradicts Cairo understandings.

Mushir al-Masri, a Gaza-based Hamas lawmaker, said in a statement sent to the
press that Abbas' call for the unusual PNC session to appoint six new members of
the PLO executive committee "is a desperate attempt to breathe life into the
dead ragged body of the PLO."

"Mahmoud Abbas still insists on dragging the Palestinian people to the abyss and
do not want an agreement or reconciliation," said al-Masri, adding "holding the
national council at this moment means breaking the bridges for reaching a
reconciliation agreement. "

Six members of the executive committee had died, namely late Fatah leader Yasser
Arafat who died in Nov. 2004, Yasser Amer, independent, Suleiman al-Najab, with
the people's party, Faisal al- Hiseini, with Fatah, Imeil Jarjou'i, Christian,
and Samir Ghusha, leader of the PSF who died three weeks ago.

Speaker of the PNC Salim al-Za'noon warned on Tuesday that the PLO executive
committee, with 12 members only and one of them not able to attend the
committees regular sessions, "would lose quorum if the six vacant seats are not
fulfilled as soon as possible."

Palestinian observers believe that Abbas is becoming the strongest man who has
been working calmly as the chairman of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
where he succeeded to a great extent to renovate and unify his old, corrupted
and weak Fatah party.

"Abbas has proved that he is the strongest man among the Palestinians. He also
succeeded to a great extent in bringing the PLO strong and back on track," said
Mohamed Abu Serreya, a Gaza- based specialist in political science who works for
a local NGO.

"Abbas strengthened the Palestinian (National) Authority, he reunified and
reformed Fatah movement, he also renovated the PLO executive committee, and he
is working hard on taming Hamas movement by ending its control of Gaza and
holding the elections on time," he added.

On the internal level, Abbas told the PNC members that holding the general
elections, legislative and presidential, in the Palestinian territories that
include the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip " is the only choice if Egyptian-sponsored
national dialogue to reach a reconciliation failed."

The dialogue involves Hamas and Abbas' Fatah movement in a bid to reconcile them
under a unified government ruling the Hamas- controlled Gaza Strip and the West
Bank where the PNA is based.

"The Palestinian split can only be handled in democratic means, " Abbas said,
referring to the political split between the two Palestinian territories that
followed Hamas' violent takeover of the coastal enclave in 2007.

Presidential and parliamentary elections "would be carried out in the Gaza Strip
and in the West Bank to protect the Palestinian institutions," Abbas said, but
he added that he will go ahead with the national dialogue "but not for any
price."

Hamas leaders announced that they reject any attempt to hold the Palestinian
elections before signing a reconciliation agreement in Cairo. Such an agreement
is expected to be signed in Cairo after the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, in late
September.
