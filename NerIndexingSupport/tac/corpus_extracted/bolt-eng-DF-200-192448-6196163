 
 
England's most arrogant politician.
 
 
Who do you think?
 
 
I'd almost be tempted to put Gordon Brown forward (somebody'll have to - it's terribly predictable) if you consider him as part of England. It takes serious arrogant stones to hang around when very few want you.
 
 
George Galloway.
 
 
A toss up between Hazel Blears and George Osbourne
 
 
David Cameron, George Osbourne, and every other conservative!
 
 
Isn't this a sketch from The Fast Show ?
 
 
David Cameron, he is so smug right now.

Although the foreign secretary David Miliband has defo had his moments with the way he treats foreign visitors
 
 
If you mean Great Britain.... George Galloway (oh how I detest that man!), Ed Miliband (he's just like 'that's all very well, but I'm right because I'm me blah blah'), Tony McNalty (evil man!).

To a minor extent anyway almost every Labour cabinet-member.
 
 
George Galloway or Alex Salmond are all I can think of. I know Salmond is obviously not an English politician in any sense, but he deserves a special mention for being arrogant beyond belief.
 
 
George Galloway.
 
 
All of them?
 
 
David Cameron, although he does have stronger traits. George Galloway is another good one, nothing like a bit of outright attention-seeking that achieves nothing.
 
 
Daniel Hannan or George Galloway.

what, you mean the one where the politician just goes 'NO. No. I'm not doing that' to whatever people say?
 
 
David Cameron
 
 
don't all politicians have to be arrogant:?? to support their party? otherwise they would never win.

but the 'traditional' conservatives are quite high up with their traditional party of government etc.
 
 
Galloway, Osbourne, Mandelson. Perhaps Peter Hain too.
 
 
Cameron

Being our prime minister (As part of the UK), i think it's fairly safe to consider him part of England..
 
 
All successful politicians are incredibly arrogant or else they couldn't have risen so far. I've heard George Galloway speak and he is extremely arrogant but also very intelligent, and charismatic. Beyond him, Osborne, Cameron, and most of the Tory party, and Labour cabinet are.

He's from Fife. I was just making sure.

He's a very silly man  
 
 
Jacqui Smith. My view is probably coloured somewhat by disgust-tinted glasses, but every time I hear her speak she oozes arrogance and the misplaced view that she must be right. Remember her little fantasy about ID cards, where she was apparently being approached all the time by random people telling her how awesome they thought the scheme was, and how they couldn't wait to get one?

Eugh.
 
 
MANDELSON. By several miles. No one has a face that says "I'm running the country and there's nothing you can do about it!" with more clarity than his.
 
 
A lot of this is just based on mannerisms rather than any intimate knowledge of the individual's personality. As such, I'd say it's a pretty pointless discussion.

Some people mentioned Daniel Hannan for example - I think that's a completely different thing. He's just a man who doesn't have much to lose by being forthright with his pretty fringe opinions. I'd say in other parties you find people like Dennis Skinner and George Galloway who are in broadly the same position.

That said, I think George Osborne would buy tickets to himself.

I don't think Osborne is arrogant, he's just a complete numpty.

Oh - Michael Gove really gets me annoyed. Tory Shadow Education secretary. He is completely dismissive of everyone around him in an interview room.
 
 
Gordon Brown, Peter Mandelson and Harriet Harman. They just have so many detestable qualities!! GRRR!!

Well said. Arrogance is in their genes.
