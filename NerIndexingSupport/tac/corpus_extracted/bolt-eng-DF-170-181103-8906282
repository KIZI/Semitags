 Florida Loses $2.4 Billion For High-Speed Trains 

 
The project, which would have connected Tampa and Orlando with high-speed trains, was rejected by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican. He said he didn't want to obligate the state to pay for what could be expensive operating costs for the line.

However, the Florida Department of Transportation on Wednesday released a study showing the line connecting Tampa to Orlando would have had an operating surplus in 2015, its first year of operation.

 

This is what happens when you have a governor who runs the state like businessman and a very bad one at that, instead of like a politician. There would have been job creation in this but Repugs never promised job creation in their campaigns did they? Its clear they don't fucking care.
 
 
High speed rail is an economic loser. It has never worked, outside of one or two well traveled corridors. The guv was right. An expensive boondoggle that would have cost taxpayer money for no benefit.

Go looking for it and you will find it, asshole. Quit being a mouthpiece for HuffPo.

Yep. And a good portion of the citizens here don't want it because it only covers a small portion of the State, will create a few temporary jobs, and then the Taxpayers will get stuck with it.

It's a bad deal like everything else coming out of the Disctrict of Criminals these days.

Governments SHOULD be run like a business. The politicians have pushed most budgets into RED INK. The Governor is protecting the taxpayers as he should. And you have a problem with that?

No shit, why would you ever want anyone who knows how to pay the bills, live on a budget, and grow? It would be much better having someone who knows nothing but how to spend, and go to the taxpayers for more money when they can't pay for nonsense like this.
 
 
Flaylo, why don't you recall Scott?

Isn't that the way it works now?

Just wait until the Legislature starts addressing Education budget. The unions here are already gearing up for it.
 
 
The only place high speed rail makes sense is between Washington D.C. and New York City. That's about it.
 
 
No government ought not to be run like businesses.

They have entirely different missions so suggesting that one ought to act like the other is silly.

Would you say that corporations ought to act like government?

No of course not.

Their mission is to make a profit for their owners, and that is a good thing.

Government's role is to look after the well being of society. And that is a good thing.

Confusing those roles is the definition of FASCISM.

Many of you cons are really fascists and don't apparently realize that what you believe is exactly what Musssolini, Hitler and Franco believed.

I don't tell you this as an insult, I'm just telling you what the political science word is to describe your beliefs.

Yes, and if it was needed elsewhere? The private sector would have already addressed it.

As a Californian I applaud the Gov. of Florida; soon we may benefit from his foolishness if our own pols plan for the future and not seek a return to the past. While I understand editec's belief of the New Right being fascist and generally agree, they're also reactionary. Maybe a new word needs to be coined to describe an ideology bereft of ideas. looking backwards and build on a foundation of emotion?

From my POV I would not be packing up my car going to find a parking lot to pay for, getting on a train at what ever cost, getting on a train getting off finding and loading a cab to go to a resort when I can do it for less money and in less time less hassle by my own car.
Thats not proof, but it is the fact and you can multiply that by 2 million for the people in my community we may live in florida but we aint stupid.

Great. More rail for us in California. I'd much rather travel by train than drive from SF to LA or San Diego. Having traveled throughtout Europe on rail I look forward to the day one can travel from downtown Sacramento or San Francisco to downtown LA without the hassle of gridlock on freeways, $5 a gallon gas and the wear on tires, engine and transmission.
Instead of sitting behind the wheel I can sit and have a meal, read a book, surf the web or play a game of chess; have a cold one in the bar, meet new people and share information on places to go and things to do.
Building rail will provide jobs, long term and permanent, and save oil by moving people and products around our nation lowering consumer costs; anyone who shops for grocery's or any other product knows that the spike in fuel prices raises the cost of everything transported.

Good. You can have it. Most Socialists and their Societies enjoy mass transit payed for by others anyway. (And your choice). Florida chooses to hold on to their Liberty.

Yes because California's budget is balanced so they can afford to spend taxpayer money on expensive play toys for the urban middle class. Right?

I traveled the same way in Europe.
Im not going to go through the hassle for a short trip even to Miami.
Orlando resorts are 1.5 hour by speed limit which everyone exceeds, it is about an hour away from the beach here.

The kind of plan that fits California perfectly. The short sighted ding-dongs look only at the short term jobs it creates. Never mind when it's operating at a loss and the already broke state has to cover the shortfall, or go to the taxpayers of states who were smart enough to pass on the nonsense.
 
 
 
 
Flaylo, why don't you recall Scott?

Isn't that the way it works now?

 

Just wait until the Legislature starts addressing Education budget. The unions here are already gearing up for it.

 

Most of what Scott is asking for won't get enacted.

High speed rail in Florida is a waste of money. It would never have the ridership to pay operating costs.
Boston to NY to Philly to DC is the only route that is economical

God you are an idiot.

There is no demand for high speed rail in CA. The cities on the peninsula are challenging it in court. The Central Valley doesn't want it. It's just a silly boondoggle that Sacto Bureaucrats think is a good idea. The federal funding doesn't cover operating costs, so, if the train system is built, it will be yet another Bleeding Wound in the state budget.

We keep telling them that short-term gains at the expense of the taxpayers is of no consolation long term? They balk at the notion.
It only shows me two dimensional thinking at best.
 
 
 
 Florida Loses $2.4 Billion For High-Speed Trains 

 
The project, which would have connected Tampa and Orlando with high-speed trains, was rejected by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican. He said he didn't want to obligate the state to pay for what could be expensive operating costs for the line.

However, the Florida Department of Transportation on Wednesday released a study showing the line connecting Tampa to Orlando would have had an operating surplus in 2015, its first year of operation.

 

This is what happens when you have a governor who runs the state like businessman and a very bad one at that, instead of like a politician. There would have been job creation in this but Repugs never promised job creation in their campaigns did they? Its clear they don't fucking care.

 

I do believe the premise is flawed.

Florida did not "LOSE" 2.4 billion it never had. It REFUSED $2.4 billion it did not need or want.
 
 
 
High speed rail is an economic loser. It has never worked, outside of one or two well traveled corridors. The guv was right. An expensive boondoggle that would have cost taxpayer money for no benefit.

 

YEAH!!!....jus' like them, there.....

The only way it will work is if there is a need and a demand for it by market forces. Had there been such a need? The Railroads wouldn't have dropped their passenger services in the early 70's.

The only reason why rail passenger travel exists now is by the Government. Witness AMTRAK.

How many in Tampa want to take a train to Orlando and vice versa? Very little demand that isn't already being met by automobile. The real cost is unknown on that project, and Florida will have to make up any shortfalls, and then be burdened with deficits in ridership tolls from now on. Tampa has already seen public works failures which they are paying for, and don't want much more in that department.

So you think government control from cradle to grave is Freedom?
Not in my book. Smaller Federal Government = freedom to me.

You're right. It's never worked - inside the US. Outside the US, it's worked all over the world. Oops.
 
 
Maybe, after Soros tells him that he's decided not to run for the Presidency in 2012, Obama can start a private rail company?

Oh yea, "high speed trains" are evidence of "usurpation of LIBERTY". I forgot that part. Seems I left my "looniness" at home. Thanks for bringing yours.
 
 
 
The only place high speed rail makes sense is between Washington D.C. and New York City. That's about it.

 

boston NYC Washington.
La-san diego. maybe even La-San fran.
I could see a Atlanta Miami type rail working.
you also have to note gas is spiking again, people are cutting down on travel. Now if you have a cheap way of going long distances without using your car and gas, people will be more willing to use it.

China doesnt think its a bad idea. And before you knock China, you should note that a lot of US companies are investing there because its booming. In China this just got done.

From my POV I would not be packing up my car going to find a parking lot to pay for, getting on a train at what ever cost, getting on a train getting off finding and loading a cab to go to a resort when I can do it for less money and in less time less hassle by my own car.
Thats not proof, but it is the fact and you can multiply that by 2 million for the people in my community we may live in florida but we aint stupid.

 

Great. More rail for us in California. I'd much rather travel by train than drive from SF to LA or San Diego. Having traveled throughtout Europe on rail I look forward to the day one can travel from downtown Sacramento or San Francisco to downtown LA without the hassle of gridlock on freeways, $5 a gallon gas and the wear on tires, engine and transmission.
Instead of sitting behind the wheel I can sit and have a meal, read a book, surf the web or play a game of chess; have a cold one in the bar, meet new people and share information on places to go and things to do.
Building rail will provide jobs, long term and permanent and save oil by moving people and products around our nation lowering consumer costs for transportation. Anyone who shops for grocery's or any other product knows that the spike in fuel prices raises the cost of everything transported.

 

Good. You can have it. Most Socialists and their Societies enjoy mass transit payed for by others anyway. (And your choice). Florida chooses to hold on to their Liberty.

 

this has nothing to do with liberty you dumb drunk.
 
 
 
 
 
And by coerced TAXATION and Gubmint manipulation, usurpation of LIBERTY, that left them no other choice... right?

 

Oh yea, "high speed trains" are evidence of "usurpation of LIBERTY". I forgot that part. Seems I left my "looniness" at home. Thanks for bringing yours.

All of a sudden is the world market on oil going to go, HAHAH i know what we can do, We can raise prices in oil and force people to ride trains! Yeah we are evil!

God you are an idiot.

There is no demand for high speed rail in CA. The cities on the peninsula are challenging it in court. The Central Valley doesn't want it. It's just a silly boondoggle that Sacto Bureaucrats think is a good idea. The federal funding doesn't cover operating costs, so, if the train system is built, it will be yet another Bleeding Wound in the state budget.

 

We keep telling them that short-term gains at the expense of the taxpayers is of no consolation long term? They balk at the notion.
It only shows me two dimensional thinking at best.

 

longterm drunk, is gas is going to cost more.
 
 
 
 
 Florida Loses $2.4 Billion For High-Speed Trains 

 
The project, which would have connected Tampa and Orlando with high-speed trains, was rejected by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican. He said he didn't want to obligate the state to pay for what could be expensive operating costs for the line.

However, the Florida Department of Transportation on Wednesday released a study showing the line connecting Tampa to Orlando would have had an operating surplus in 2015, its first year of operation.

 

This is what happens when you have a governor who runs the state like businessman and a very bad one at that, instead of like a politician. There would have been job creation in this but Repugs never promised job creation in their campaigns did they? Its clear they don't fucking care.

 

Governments SHOULD be run like a business. The politicians have pushed most budgets into RED INK. The Governor is protecting the taxpayers as he should. And you have a problem with that?

 

uhhhhh, like this business?

 Florida 

 
With the very close Florida gubernatorial race coming down to the wire today, the only thing that can be said with certainty about the outcome before the polls close is that the new governor will be a record-setter. Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate, would be Floridas first female governor. Rick Scott, the Republican candidate, would be the first governor to have served as CEO of a firm that paid a record-setting fine to the US government to settle fraud charges. In addition to resigning as CEO during the investigation that led to $1.7 billion in fines being paid, Scott also likely would set the record for the number of times invoking the Fifth Amendments right against testimony that might incriminate himself, having invoked it 75 times in a deposition on a different case while the fraud case was still an active investigation.

 

 
As for Scott, here is PolitiFact on the fine:

Even when condensed to two paragraphs, you can see the potential land mines Rick Scott, a Republican running for governor, might face over his former hospital chain, Columbia/HCA.

Paragraph 1. Scott grew Columbia/HCA into the nations biggest hospital system. It then became the center of a multi-state federal investigation in 1997 that centered around whether Columbia/HCA defrauded Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned under pressure in 1997 as the scope of the investigation grew.

Paragraph 2. Columbia/HCA eventually settled the fraud cases, paying a record-setting $1.7 billion in fines. The company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. Four people also were indicted; two were convicted, but those convictions were overturned on appeal. Scott himself was not indicted or questioned in the case.

 

 
 PolitiFact Florida | Rick Scott dodges answers by invoking Fifth Amendment, Democrats claim in ad 
Scott started what was first called Columbia in the spring of 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country's largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals.

In early 1997, federal agents revealed they were investigating the Columbia/HCA chain for, among other things, Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Allegations included that Columbia/HCA billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and that the hospital chain would perform one type of medical test but bill the federal government for a more expensive test or procedure. Agents seized records from Columbia facilities across the country in Tennessee, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Florida.

Scott resigned in the middle of the federal investigation in July 1997. Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations; the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle, and did. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. The company agreed to further settlements in 2002, paying an additional $881 million in fines.

Seeing how every government prediction of costs are always wrong and projects always cost more, its a good call.
Besides, if it could actually "make money"(i.e. surpluss) then let those evil private corporations do it for greed.

And by the way, building a train isn't going to "create" jobs in the long run. All it will do is employ some illegal aliens for construction work temproarily.

High speed rail is an economic loser. It has never worked, outside of one or two well traveled corridors. The guv was right. An expensive boondoggle that would have cost taxpayer money for no benefit.

 

People have been talking about the need for high speed rail from Tampa to Orlando for 20 years. No, it's not a boondoggle. It's a question of raising the money at a time when the states is under huge budgetary pressure.

IMHO, infrastructure projects are always to expensive and there are questions as to whether the project makes economic sense. In 20 years, the need is twice as great and cost three times as much and we have the same discussion again.
 
 
 
The only place high speed rail makes sense is between Washington D.C. and New York City. That's about it.

No government ought not to be run like businesses.

They have entirely different missions so suggesting that one ought to act like the other is silly.

Would you say that corporations ought to act like government?

No of course not.

Their mission is to make a profit for their owners, and that is a good thing.

Government's role is to look after the well being of society. And that is a good thing.

Confusing those roles is the definition of FASCISM.

Great. More rail for us in California. I'd much rather travel by train than drive from SF to LA or San Diego. Having traveled throughtout Europe on rail I look forward to the day one can travel from downtown Sacramento or San Francisco to downtown LA without the hassle of gridlock on freeways, $5 a gallon gas and the wear on tires, engine and transmission.
Instead of sitting behind the wheel I can sit and have a meal, read a book, surf the web or play a game of chess; have a cold one in the bar, meet new people and share information on places to go and things to do.

From my POV I would not be packing up my car going to find a parking lot to pay for, getting on a train at what ever cost, getting on a train getting off finding and loading a cab to go to a resort when I can do it for less money and in less time less hassle by my own car.
Thats not proof, but it is the fact and you can multiply that by 2 million for the people in my community we may live in florida but we aint stupid.

 

Great. More rail for us in California. I'd much rather travel by train than drive from SF to LA or San Diego. Having traveled throughtout Europe on rail I look forward to the day one can travel from downtown Sacramento or San Francisco to downtown LA without the hassle of gridlock on freeways, $5 a gallon gas and the wear on tires, engine and transmission.
Instead of sitting behind the wheel I can sit and have a meal, read a book, surf the web or play a game of chess; have a cold one in the bar, meet new people and share information on places to go and things to do.
Building rail will provide jobs, long term and permanent and save oil by moving people and products around our nation lowering consumer costs for transportation. Anyone who shops for grocery's or any other product knows that the spike in fuel prices raises the cost of everything transported.

 

Good. You can have it. Most Socialists and their Societies enjoy mass transit payed for by others anyway.

 

....While " conservatives " prefer the comfort o' packin'-on-the-lard, in their (own) backyard.

As a Californian I applaud the Gov. of Florida; soon we may benefit from his foolishness if our own pols plan for the future and not seek a return to the past. While I understand editec's belief of the New Right being fascist and generally agree, they're also reactionary. Maybe a new word needs to be coined to describe an ideology bereft of ideas. looking backwards and build on a foundation of emotion?

 

Yes because California's budget is balanced so they can afford to spend taxpayer money on expensive play toys for the urban middle class. Right?

 

Yeah....that's what they are.... play-toys.....

 Florida Loses $2.4 Billion For High-Speed Trains 

 
The project, which would have connected Tampa and Orlando with high-speed trains, was rejected by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican. He said he didn't want to obligate the state to pay for what could be expensive operating costs for the line.

However, the Florida Department of Transportation on Wednesday released a study showing the line connecting Tampa to Orlando would have had an operating surplus in 2015, its first year of operation.

 

This is what happens when you have a governor who runs the state like businessman and a very bad one at that, instead of like a politician. There would have been job creation in this but Repugs never promised job creation in their campaigns did they? Its clear they don't fucking care.

 

Do you work hard at being an idiot?

The pro high speed rail group High-Speed Rail in America says that the FDoT study is based on faulty assumptions and overly optimistic ridership projections, and rates the Florida corridor at the bottom in projects to back. The route is way too short, and the train would not move fast enough to compete with cars.

 High-Speed Rail in America - America 2050 

That is what you get when you let a governor run a state like a business, intelligent and well informed decisions.

in one of our last Elections, High Speed Rail between L.A. and Las Vegas was shot down by the voters.....maybe its not that popular of an idea out here as well.....

 

The only way it will work is if there is a need and a demand for it by market forces. Had there been such a need? The Railroads wouldn't have dropped their passenger services in the early 70's.

The only reason why rail passenger travel exists now is by the Government. Witness AMTRAK.

The only place high speed rail makes sense is between Washington D.C. and New York City. That's about it.

 

boston NYC Washington.
La-san diego. maybe even La-San fran.
I could see a Atlanta Miami type rail working.
you also have to note gas is spiking again, people are cutting down on travel. Now if you have a cheap way of going long distances without using your car and gas, people will be more willing to use it.

China doesnt think its a bad idea. And before you knock China, you should note that a lot of US companies are investing there because its booming. In China this just got done.
Fuck the whiners.

 

Or LA to San Francisco, Berkley and San Jose. Or through central California, the vegetable capital of America.

Or all over the East Coast.

High Speed trains are more than 30% more efficient than US trains. They are competitive with airplanes. You can have people commuting to work from over a hundred miles away, which opens up job opportunities everywhere they run.

But right wingers don't see the possibilities. Of course. They can't. They are limited that way. These are people who have no use for science or technology. They want to cut education. They want to include "mysticism" as an alternate and acceptable part of "science". They can't see the difference between a "scientific theory" and a "wild guess".

Let us take a look at high speed rail in one of the favorite places of the left, China.

 
In his seven years as chief of the Chinese  Railways Ministry , Liu Zhijun built a commercial and political colossus that spanned continents and elevated the lowly train to a national symbol of pride and technological prowess.
His abrupt sacking by the Communist Party is casting that empire in a decidedly different light, raising doubts not only about Mr. Lius stewardship and the corruption that dogs  China  s vast public-works projects, but also, perhaps, the safety, financial soundness and long-term viability of a rail system that has captured the worlds attention.
 Mr. Liu, 58, was fired Saturday and is being investigated  by the partys disciplinary committee for severe violations of discipline, a euphemism for corruption. His high government rank  minister-level officials are rarely fired under such a cloud  hints at far deeper dissatisfaction with one of Chinas most publicized and sweeping domestic initiatives.

Seems that all is not well in China.

Tell me something, why would a person who claims to look to the future prefer a mode of transportation that was built by robber barons, is highly prone to corruption and greed, is not flexible enough to get people where they need to go, and generally disenfranchises the poor people who live in rural areas?

Could it be that you have not actually examined the evidence, and just like it because Obama supports it and Republicans do not? Would you be as supportive if Bush had made it a signature of his presidency, and Democrats opposed it?

Much of Europe is connected with bullet trains and Asia is catching up fast, while lines are in various stages of planning in South America and the Middle East.

Or all over the East Coast.

High Speed trains are more than 30% more efficient than US trains. They are competitive with airplanes. You can have people commuting to work from over a hundred miles away, which opens up job opportunities everywhere they run.

But right wingers don't see the possibilities. Of course. They can't. They are limited that way. These are people who have no use for science or technology. They want to cut education. They want to include "mysticism" as an alternate and acceptable part of "science". They can't see the difference between a "scientific theory" and a "wild guess".

 

Ok genius, if it is such a no-brainer and so economical... why hasn't it been done?

 

It has been done. And it's being done. Just not in this country.

 

Why not?

The only place high speed rail makes sense is between Washington D.C. and New York City. That's about it.

 

boston NYC Washington.
La-san diego. maybe even La-San fran.
I could see a Atlanta Miami type rail working.
you also have to note gas is spiking again, people are cutting down on travel. Now if you have a cheap way of going long distances without using your car and gas, people will be more willing to use it.

China doesnt think its a bad idea. And before you knock China, you should note that a lot of US companies are investing there because its booming. In China this just got done.
Fuck the whiners.

Seriously though, a mode of transportation that is fixed on rails (the ultimate in inflexibility) and travels over the ground (even at high speed) will lose to air travel for long distances and automobiles for short distances.

Now if a private corporation wants to develop a high speed rail line without tax payer money - GO FOR IT. If it is such a great idea, surely entreprenuers and investors would be lined up to participate, right?

 Rail Europe: 20 percent off Eurostar high-speed train – Travel – Sun-Sentinel 

 The High Speed Rail Revolution is Happening Now « The Telltale Rail 

Some people won't fly, ever. The actual travel time is a little more, but the cost will drop as more of the trains are used. There is less hassle than going to an airport.

Check out the map of HSTs all over Europe.

Remember, this isn't new technology. Europeans have been building HSTs for years. There is plenty of data for study. And now there is talk of a HSP from China to London.
 
 
Why trains? If we are going to move backwards with ancient, restrictive technology, why not have a national initiative to invest in rickshaws? They work in CHINA!!! Think of all the jobs!

High speed rail is an economic loser. It has never worked, outside of one or two well traveled corridors. The guv was right. An expensive boondoggle that would have cost taxpayer money for no benefit.

 

No benefit? How about a 2 hour train ride from Chicago to St. Louis whic takes 5 hours by car. Yeah you're right no benefit.

Government doesn't do things to make a profit. Its not a business. It does things to better society. Think about it (I know hard thing to do, but at least try):

A 2 hour train ride cuts a business cost to travel, meaning less costs meaning they can save or create new jobs, meaning employment rate goes down, economy gets better, American gets better.

Oh and maybe able to save American manufacturing because transportation cost decrease.

But yeah absolutely no benefit.  
 
 
Another thing to add:

The Florida rail from Orlando-Tampa is unnecessary. But other areas like the Midwest (Chicago-St. Louis, Chicago-Cincinatti) and West Coast (LA-San Diego) are needed.

Let me tell you something, if the Japanese cannot make money when they cram riders into the train like they do, no one can.

Funny thing about those costs, they only go up. Ridership never reaches the level it needs to end government subsides, even when they offer massive discounts to entice people away from those planes no one likes.

The horse and buggy is not new technology either, but you do not see many people using them. You know why?

Take a look at a calendar sometime, we live in the 21st century, not the 19th. Did you know that they had a 100mph + train back in 1893? That they got faster shortly after the turn of the century?

 Museum of Science and Industry | What's Here | Exhibits | Transportation Gallery | The Exhibit | 999 Steam Locomotive 

That means that this technology has been around for as long as they have had trains? Why do you want to go backward instead of forward? Are you secretly a conservative that wants to make progressives look stupid? You can tell me, i promise not to tell anyone who does not post on USMB.

How does making something faster cut costs? Going faster uses more energy, more resources, and is more dangerous, which adds to liability, thus adding to costs. Not to mention that in that train passes through at least 10 separate communities, none of which are going to allow a train to speed through at more than 30 mph, which will mean that the mythical bullet train will have to either go around those cities somehow, or fly over them.

Oops, we are back to planes again. Isn't modern technology wonderful? Tell me something, since you believe in high speed rail, do you also believe in unicorn dust and pots of gold at the end of rainbows?

Newsflash RD - "choo choo" trains are not new technology and they make no more sense than rickshaws.

In fact, Rickshaws make more sense for a liberal progressive! Rickshaws would put millions of unemployed people to work. They could form a labor union for rickshaw drivers. They would them get good union jobs with good union benefits. One rickshaw per person= 300 million new jobs. Good Union jobs too! paying good Union wages and Good Union Benefits!!! Fat people would have to pay for 2 rickshaw drivers (union rules!) or walk - making them healthier for Obamacare!! New legislation could be enacted that would force citizens to use rickshaws for all travel. It'd be a brave new world!!!
 
 
i don't know whether a train between tampa and orlando is worth it or not....i do know it is wall to wall traffic, most any time of the day, between tampa and orlando on I-4....

the one thing that should be considered in this whole debate on trains, is that these higher than high gasoline prices could move more people towards train services than ever before....i don't think this can be discounted...

and perhaps the private sector will eventually see this and pursue the business...

Yep. And a good portion of the citizens here don't want it because it only covers a small portion of the State, will create a few temporary jobs, and then the Taxpayers will get stuck with it.

It's a bad deal like everything else coming out of the Disctrict of Criminals these days.

 

Saying that highspeed trains never worked is an outright fucking lie, have any of you two dickheads been to Europe? I can get on a train right here where I live in Germany and be in Paris in two hours, same with Rome. When you say the word NEVER you're making an absolute statement which require facts to support it, now prove that high speed trains have NEVER worked.

How is it a straw man to point out that every place high speed rail exists it is subsidized by the government? So, again, does a government an industry that requires government subsidies to exist at all, never mind survive, meet your definition of working? If it does, you can never again complain about any government bailout of banks or the fat cats that run them, because you believe that makes them successful.

A government subsidy is a bail out, which is why intelligent people oppose them both.

 Florida Loses $2.4 Billion For High-Speed Trains 

 
The project, which would have connected Tampa and Orlando with high-speed trains, was rejected by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican. He said he didn't want to obligate the state to pay for what could be expensive operating costs for the line.

However, the Florida Department of Transportation on Wednesday released a study showing the line connecting Tampa to Orlando would have had an operating surplus in 2015, its first year of operation.

 

This is what happens when you have a governor who runs the state like businessman and a very bad one at that, instead of like a politician. There would have been job creation in this but Repugs never promised job creation in their campaigns did they? Its clear they don't fucking care.

 

Do not care?
Where was the 2.5 billion coming from?
printed money?
was you going to pay for it?
operating surplus? does this mean the 2.5 billion would have been paid back?
Why does the word operating surplus seem to me a word that has no meaning

What good is a government boondoggle that "creates" jobs if the project ends up as a perpetual drain on the economy because it can't run without continual massive infusions of tax dollars?

There is not one public transportation system that I know of that actually runs solely on the revenue it generates.

And since i will probably never use a high speed rail in Florida, why should any of my tax dollars pay for it? If people in Florida want a high speed train then let them pay for it.

I live down here in Florida and I agree with you 100%. I back the Gov on this one.

High speed rail sounds great but who pays for it if no one uses it??

We the taxpayers of Florida of course.

AMTRAK looses money every year and I have no doubt that a high speed rail in Florida would do the same.

High speed rail would be good for NYC, Boston and places like that where you have a big influx of people that are working in those cities. I think it could be a viable option in that scenario.
 
 
Its deficit spending

If we are going to deficit spend that much there are better things we can do for the economy than that

Another thing to add:

The Florida rail from Orlando-Tampa is unnecessary. But other areas like the Midwest (Chicago-St. Louis, Chicago-Cincinatti) and West Coast (LA-San Diego) are needed.

 

LA to San Diego has been talked about for years....were is it?......same with going to Santa Barbara.....were is it?.....LA to Vegas was voted down because most of the voters said that if they are going to Vegas they want to get there quick they will fly for what 80 bucks and many enjoy getting out and doing the drive....im not saying a HSR system would not be needed somewhere around here,but the S.Cal region needs to concentrate on the local driving,the morning and evening drives the freeways are pretty congested....

Please explain how going backwards to a technology that is anti-freedom, "green", heavily unionized, and builds class enmity, conservative?

You'd create jobs, increase the health of people, get cars off the street, cut petroleum use, clean the air, limit population movement, prevent sprawl, increase union membership and create more government. Sounds very liberal to me.

Funny thing about those costs, they only go up. Ridership never reaches the level it needs to end government subsides, even when they offer massive discounts to entice people away from those planes no one likes.

 
Check out the map of HSTs all over Europe.

Remember, this isn't new technology. Europeans have been building HSTs for years. There is plenty of data for study. And now there is talk of a HSP from China to London.

 

The horse and buggy is not new technology either, but you do not see many people using them. You know why?

Take a look at a calendar sometime, we live in the 21st century, not the 19th. Did you know that they had a 100mph + train back in 1893? That they got faster shortly after the turn of the century?

 Museum of Science and Industry | What's Here | Exhibits | Transportation Gallery | The Exhibit | 999 Steam Locomotive 

That means that this technology has been around for as long as they have had trains? Why do you want to go backward instead of forward? Are you secretly a conservative that wants to make progressives look stupid? You can tell me, i promise not to tell anyone who does not post on USMB.

 

Conservatives think "steam engines" are "high speed trains"?

Ok, that sheds an entirely different light on the "debate".

 

Designed and built in the 1950's for Russian rail lines. Put back into service post Soviet collapse by private operators in 1990, and some are still being used today.

Burns coal or oil like a BITCH but is one helluva locomotive.

Don't forget, till after the Bullet train and high speed electrics, the fastest locomotive in the world was a coal fired A4 Mallard that reached speeds of 126mph. Most diesels won't do this speed, and most tracks aren't in condition to handle it anyway in most countries. Course, Maglev beats em all but costs a FORTUNE in comparison to build and is even less proven.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Florida Loses $2.4 Billion For High-Speed Trains 

This is what happens when you have a governor who runs the state like businessman and a very bad one at that, instead of like a politician. There would have been job creation in this but Repugs never promised job creation in their campaigns did they? Its clear they don't fucking care.

 

Florida isn't Europe, clown....

 

Who said it was you dumb ass motherfucker? Get a geography lesson or learn not to build a strawman.

 

The US can never build a european style railway system for two VERY critical reasons:

Geographical size
Population density

This is why Japan and Europe have excellent rail systems. They have the ridership and they are small. Can you imagine a functioning commuter rail in Kansas? I sure as hell can't. I know you coasties don't give a shit about flyover country, but this is the kind of place the majority of Americans live; in small cities and large towns. They don't live blocks from a rail station, they live 3-30 MILES away if they're lucky. The population density is not there to cover the costs to supply the needs of the community.

In the 19th century, the great plains had populations close to rail hubs at first. Farmers and remote agricultural communities from Walnut Grove to Sleepy Eye, who can't live next to them, are forced to use other means to get around, mostly horse and buggy back then. You are proposing to fill the world again with railroads to service all of North America (Canookia is even worse BTW once you leave Toronto). I find it humorous to remember the Colorado Southern Galloping Gooses of the early 1900's. A bus essentially that ran on the rails. Great for small mining towns many miles apart in the mountains... but that's when the whole town was a short walk away and they were very unhelpful for daily travel.

Fantasy. Utter fantasy. This is why the dream must fail. Rail is good for a few basic things. Long distance freight hauling, and intermediate distance high speed passenger rail between high to extreme density population hubs. Everything else is best served by car or truck.

Dickhead, his statement was that high speed rail never worked so I'm challenging him to back his shit up, take your strawman and shove it up your dumb, funky, fucked up ass.

 

How is it a straw man to point out that every place high speed rail exists it is subsidized by the government? So, again, does a government an industry that requires government subsidies to exist at all, never mind survive, meet your definition of working? If it does, you can never again complain about any government bailout of banks or the fat cats that run them, because you believe that makes them successful.

A government subsidy is a bail out, which is why intelligent people oppose them both.

 

i don't give a fuck about your bitching and paranoia about the big, bad federal government you mindlessly believe exists, I challenging the lie that high speed rail has never worked which Rabbi stated, your paranoid bullshit has nothing to do with this stated claim so shut the fuck up with your strawman because thats what it is.

 

You do not believe that the government exists? Why am I even talking to you then?

I present you with the fact that over 100 years ago trains were the fastest form of transportation. People still chose to drive and/or fly because it is more convenient that trains. Trains do not go anywhere there are no tracks. Cars can go almost anywhere, even places horses cannot. Planes can take off and land places it would be impossible to build rails to.

We live in the 21st century, not the 19th. You are the one that is looking backward here.
 
 
 
 
 
Another thing to add:

The Florida rail from Orlando-Tampa is unnecessary. But other areas like the Midwest (Chicago-St. Louis, Chicago-Cincinatti) and West Coast (LA-San Diego) are needed.

 

LA to San Diego has been talked about for years....were is it?......same with going to Santa Barbara.....were is it?.....LA to Vegas was voted down because most of the voters said that if they are going to Vegas they want to get there quick they will fly for what 80 bucks and many enjoy getting out and doing the drive....im not saying a HSR system would not be needed somewhere around here,but the S.Cal region needs to concentrate on the local driving,the morning and evening drives the freeways are pretty congested....

 

Everyone enjoys 10 hours of driving.

 

show me were i said EVERYONE Dean.....or maybe you got a link?....and i dont know what YOUR driving......but i can get there in 4-5 hrs.....

Horseshit. Chicago-Milwaukee-Gary, maybe. You have high enough density to make it worth while. Oh wait, there used to be a LOT of those in the area. thanks also to cities like Kenosha and Racine inbetween those cities. But they can't even justify the line out to Madison, and why would they bother going to Springfield or Green Bay, Terre Haute or even Lansing?

No, there is no real need for high speed rail in the mid west. That died with the interstate system. Now, instead of hopping on the Hiawatha from Minneapolis to Chicago, or the C&NW's '400's, you get in your car and drive it in about the same time with no having to secure transportation on the other end and it goes precisely where you need, not to stations you have to work from there.

Face it, convenience and ergonomics killed rail travel. It'll kill air travel if the FAA authorizes cheap private air cars too.

Because government has extended it's tenacles to all industry in this nation in the forms of taxes and subsidies, name one industry that isn't influenced. Even oil is buried under it.

He asked for an industry that can invest billions in a project. They can and do. The smartest thing to do would be give industry it's own money back and end the taxation AND subsidies from government on them and let the market choose winners and losers.

And rail loses. No doubt about it.

I can agree with getting rid of all subsidies and tax favoritism depending on the industry, but I can not in any away agree to no taxation at all on them....that would be unfair to the rest of us tax payers. corporations utilize our government as much or more than the average citizens and they also have a great deal of lobbying power with their purse...they should be taxed as we are ALL taxed....at one time, the corporations and excise taxes etc were what this country ran on with very little individual income taxes....if we the citizen had more money in our own hands to spend, then the corps would benefit as well....

there definitely needs to be corporate tax reform....cuz what we got now, with a high marginal tax rate, is inherently unfair...where the some of the big guns are paying zeroin federal corporate income tax, and the small corp is paying 35%. the playing field is not level....imo.
 
 
I've waited years and I just got dsl in my area.... in 2011 for goodness sakes,....nothing was available to us via land....no dsl and no cable broadband, until this year with the weak dsl service...and I would not have it at all, if it weren't for the gvt subsidizing the telecommunication company for it....we had broadband in 1997 in my area in massachusetts....

sure, they got the money, but they don't always invest it in we the people...
 
 
High-speed rail is a euphemism for...circle jerk.

And circle jerking is the preferred pastime of liberals.
 
 
well, I think the high speed rail is not a necessity at this time....though I can certainly see how in some areas, it would be a benefit and it could be profitable in the future...especially with gas prices rising higher than high.
 
 
 
the playing field is not level....imo.

 

You're right. It isn't, and I can tell you why.

Arrogant elitists conspired with elected officials for special benefits for them and penalties for their enemies. They've exempted themselves from some laws, and targeted others.

Justice was blindfolded previously, but that tended to burn them too often, so they have taken the blindfold off, and given her a nice stipend to 'see things their way'.

Till you return equality to the law, reduce the tax code to a single page of "you earn from all sources X amount, we tax Y amount, no exceptions" you will have this issue in regards to justice the economy and tax.

Do you have internet cable available?

If government didn't grant monopolies to cable companies and heavily regulate the telecommunications industry (which really means protecting their oligarchy of the former AT&T pre the modified Final Judgement of Judge Green), you'd most likely have a variety of competing alternatives available in you area.

But that's the problem with overreaching government control, we never can determine what might have been if innovative people had been free to create.

Something you apparently missed in your talk about government subsidies. In order to get the money for those subsidies the government charges a tax that you have been paying for years, even though you did not have DSL access. They then mandate who gets service based on which politician has the most pull. Wouldn't you rather have paid a higher fee a few years ago and gotten the service then?
 
 
 
 
 
High speed rail is an economic loser. It has never worked, outside of one or two well traveled corridors. The guv was right. An expensive boondoggle that would have cost taxpayer money for no benefit.

 

No benefit? How about a 2 hour train ride from Chicago to St. Louis whic takes 5 hours by car. Yeah you're right no benefit.

Government doesn't do things to make a profit. Its not a business. It does things to better society. Think about it (I know hard thing to do, but at least try):

A 2 hour train ride cuts a business cost to travel, meaning less costs meaning they can save or create new jobs, meaning employment rate goes down, economy gets better, American gets better.

Oh and maybe able to save American manufacturing because transportation cost decrease.

But yeah absolutely no benefit.  

 

How does making something faster cut costs? Going faster uses more energy, more resources, and is more dangerous, which adds to liability, thus adding to costs. Not to mention that in that train passes through at least 10 separate communities, none of which are going to allow a train to speed through at more than 30 mph, which will mean that the mythical bullet train will have to either go around those cities somehow, or fly over them.

Oops, we are back to planes again. Isn't modern technology wonderful? Tell me something, since you believe in high speed rail, do you also believe in unicorn dust and pots of gold at the end of rainbows?

 

Yeah even though it has worked and will work. And it creates competition for Airliners to finally start lowering prices. But yeah it never works. By the way, they build bridges and get the bullet trains to work faster.

Watch the beginning of the video of the japan high speed rail. a 350 mile trip in 2.5 hours. Thats 140 mph. Cuts travel time in HALF. HALF. You mean to tell me I get to chicago in less than half the time and not have to go through security and the hassle of the airport? Count me in.

And this is no unicorn. This is proven to work and will work. Why you are against it is beyond retarded.

Face it, convenience and ergonomics killed rail travel. It'll kill air travel if the FAA authorizes cheap private air cars too.

 

Again you have no idea what you are talking.

First off, Chicago has a huge rail system that millions of people use everyday. Its government subsides and it serves a benefit to the community. If you take the high speed rail, you have ways to get around chicago.

Plus with a car, you have to pay for parking, pay for gas, pay for the oil, pay Maintenance and it comes out to the almost same cost.

Again, you fail. But thanks for playing.
 
 
 
Yeah even though it has worked and will work. And it creates competition for Airliners to finally start lowering prices. But yeah it never works. By the way, they build bridges and get the bullet trains to work faster.

 

If you define "has worked and will work" as being "heavily dependent on government subsidies" You are entirely correct. Personally, I do not use that definition, so I don't think it works.

By the way, the bridges have nothing to do with how fast the trains go.

 
Watch the beginning of the video of the japan high speed rail. a 350 mile trip in 2.5 hours. Thats 140 mph. Cuts travel time in HALF. HALF. You mean to tell me I get to chicago in less than half the time and not have to go through security and the hassle of the airport? Count me in.

 

So what? I never said the trains do not move fast, my point is that they are not economically viable. As for not having to go through security, that argument is not going to last very long. I have already posted a video about a search the TSA did at Savannah that netted everyone who entered the station, even if they were getting off the train. What makes you think that the TSA will not move into train stations if we ever get high speed rail?

 
And this is no unicorn. This is proven to work and will work. Why you are against it is beyond retarded.

 

Because I do not want to see the government subsidize anything. That includes things that actually make money and I consider a good investment, like NASA, never mind something that no one wants, is never going to be used, and does not work anywhere.

 

Look at that, even in Europe people prefer to drive.

 Commission for Integrated Transport 

Another funny thing, it seems that rail travel is not as clear cut an advantage over cars in fuel savings. It seems that it depends on a study that is not universally accepted as accurate.

 
When Amtrak  compares  its fuel  economy  with automobiles (see p. 19), it relies on Department of Energy  <=""> that presumes 1.6 people per car (see tables 2.13 for cars and 2.14 for Amtrak). But another Department of Energy   report  points out that cars in intercity travel tend to be more fully loaded  the average turns out to be  2.4  people.

Intercity auto trips tend to [have] higher-than-average vehicle occupancy rates, says the DOE. On average, they are as energy-efficient as rail intercity trips. Moreover, the report adds, if passenger rail competes for modal share by moving to high speed service, its energy efficiency should be reduced somewhat  making overall energy savings even more problematic.

 

 FuturePundit: The Problems With Passenger Rail 

Given the fact that the numbers do not support the unicorn dust that you spout, that real world experience has shown that people prefer to drive, and that governments are forced to invest massive amounts of money just to keep less than 10% of the population on trains, I see no reason to support it.

I have math on my side, what do you have again?

When I travel to Chicago. I take the train instead of airplane. I love seeing the countryside. Flying doesn't give you that opportunity to see America. I fly to farther locations. A car can create problems and with gas prices going up, its becoming increasing popular to use Subways and trains because its cheaper.

Preference to drive is different than the cost/benefit analysis of what works best.

 

You take a HEAVILY subsidized train to Chicago.

Why is it heavily subsidized if trains are so efficient and viable?

 

Just watch train travel increase as Obama's inaction drives up the price of gas...

 Amtrak ridership rising right along with gas prices  (March 14, 2011)

Your point? Train travel is better for the environment and the pocket book. I can believe a tea-bagger is upset their is no government interference on the free market.

Then feel free to ride every train from Amtrak to the Butt Pirate express. His point is don't drive up gas prices on purpose in an attempt to force more people to ride them because the moonbats have decided it's better.

I too enjoy seeing the countryside and being able to move around easily on a train. I've see more of Europe than most who fly from city to city.
Going 350 miles in 2.5 hours is efficient if you factor in the time to and from an outlying airport and waiting in lines. There's no doubt it saves gasoline and pollution.
 
 
Bought a high speed rail pass in Europe two years ago. One of the best ways I have ever traveled. Cheaper than renting a car and way more relaxing. Barcelona to Paris, Paris to Rudischeim, Rudischeim to Amsterdam. Great sights and interesting people. Would love to hop on a train in Cincinnati in the morning and be in Chicago in the afternoon with no headache. Canceled flights, traffic, etc...
 
 
 
 
 
Seriously though, a mode of transportation that is fixed on rails (the ultimate in inflexibility) and travels over the ground (even at high speed) will lose to air travel for long distances and automobiles for short distances.

Now if a private corporation wants to develop a high speed rail line without tax payer money - GO FOR IT. If it is such a great idea, surely entreprenuers and investors would be lined up to participate, right?

 

Tell that to Europeans, Japanese, and Chinese.

 

How many of those make money?

Let me tell you something, if the Japanese cannot make money when they cram riders into the train like they do, no one can.

 You Tube 
  You Tube 

I would rather be a sardine in a can than pack in like that.

 

That looks like a subway car to me.
If you travel by high speed trains in Europe, and I suspect Japan, you have a seat reservation...it's very comfortable.
 
 
 
 
 
High speed rail is an economic loser. It has never worked, outside of one or two well traveled corridors. The guv was right. An expensive boondoggle that would have cost taxpayer money for no benefit.

 

Yep. And a good portion of the citizens here don't want it because it only covers a small portion of the State, will create a few temporary jobs, and then the Taxpayers will get stuck with it.

It's a bad deal like everything else coming out of the Disctrict of Criminals these days.

 

Saying that highspeed trains never worked is an outright fucking lie, have any of you two dickheads been to Europe? I can get on a train right here where I live in Germany and be in Paris in two hours, same with Rome. When you say the word NEVER you're making an absolute statement which require facts to support it, now prove that high speed trains have NEVER worked.

 

What do those train rides cost?
 
 
 
This is what happens when you have a governor who runs the state like businessman and a very bad one at that, instead of like a politician.

 

Noooo.......

This is what happens when an elected official actually DOES what the people that voted for him want him to do.
We don't want it, period.

I laugh at how so many on the "left" accuse the "right" for being on the side of the rich.
Just who do you think would be the biggest users of this pink elephant?
It's 85 miles, for crying out loud!! Straight across I-4.
I don't need a multi-billion dollar behemoth to get me there.
 
 
 
 
 
If there were sufficient demand, private investors would be wiling to fund the railroads.

As there isn't, there aren't, and the true nature of these initiatives are revealed as pork and political favors under the veneer of dogooderism.

 

It's too costly of a project for private industry. Period. Name an industry other then oil who can afford to invest billions in a project.

Plus, private industry cannot use eminent domain to acquire the land needed for rail routes.

Hopefully, this will be the last time I need to explain this to you. But I'm not all that hopeful.

 

If the return on investment is there, private investors would do it, period. And look, a libby that likes eminent domain, shocker!  

 

OK, name the company who could do this high speed rail project on their own dime.

Then explain how they would be able to acquire any lands which would be in the path of the rail route.

There is nothing to like or dislike about eminent domain. It's a tool used by government, and approved by society, to advance the infrastructure needs of our country.

Your point? Train travel is better for the environment and the pocket book. I can believe a tea-bagger is upset their is no government interference on the free market.

 

Apparently you forgot that I already addressed the claim that it is better for the environment than driving cars.

 
When Amtrak  compares  its fuel  economy  with automobiles (see p. 19), it relies on Department of Energy  <=""> that presumes 1.6 people per car (see tables 2.13 for cars and 2.14 for Amtrak). But another Department of Energy   report  points out that cars in intercity travel tend to be more fully loaded  the average turns out to be  2.4  people.

Intercity auto trips tend to [have] higher-than-average vehicle occupancy rates, says the DOE. On average, they are as energy-efficient as rail intercity trips. Moreover, the report adds, if passenger rail competes for modal share by moving to high speed service, its energy efficiency should be reduced somewhat  making overall energy savings even more problematic.

 

 FuturePundit: The Problems With Passenger Rail 

Couple that with the fuel efficient, low pollution cars and the numbers are even worse.
 
 
 
 
Plus, private industry cannot use eminent domain to acquire the land needed for rail routes.

 

Oh, and good job explaining why rail is dead save for freight.

 

I agree. I want more rail for freight purposes. I want to see a drastic reduction in 18 wheelers across the country. They are a huge use of oil.

I could see a HS train from Boston-NY-DC-Sanford, FL, - just upgrade the existing Amtrak Auto Train to high speed.

Tell me something, would you have purchased that train ticket if you had to pay more than it would cost to fly the same distance? The only reason it costs less is that the government subsidizes the cost of rail travel all over Europe.

And Japan.
 
 
 
They are able to wire existing infrastructure; they will never have to create new infrastructure.

Big difference.

 

Like the existing railways between Orlando and Tampa can't be retro-fitted???

 
 
 
 
 
 
Another thing to add:

The Florida rail from Orlando-Tampa is unnecessary. But other areas like the Midwest (Chicago-St. Louis, Chicago-Cincinatti) and West Coast (LA-San Diego) are needed.

 

Horseshit. Chicago-Milwaukee-Gary, maybe. You have high enough density to make it worth while. Oh wait, there used to be a LOT of those in the area. thanks also to cities like Kenosha and Racine inbetween those cities. But they can't even justify the line out to Madison, and why would they bother going to Springfield or Green Bay, Terre Haute or even Lansing?

No, there is no real need for high speed rail in the mid west. That died with the interstate system. Now, instead of hopping on the Hiawatha from Minneapolis to Chicago, or the C&NW's '400's, you get in your car and drive it in about the same time with no having to secure transportation on the other end and it goes precisely where you need, not to stations you have to work from there.

Face it, convenience and ergonomics killed rail travel. It'll kill air travel if the FAA authorizes cheap private air cars too.

 

Again you have no idea what you are talking.

First off, Chicago has a huge rail system that millions of people use everyday. Its government subsides and it serves a benefit to the community. If you take the high speed rail, you have ways to get around chicago.

Plus with a car, you have to pay for parking, pay for gas, pay for the oil, pay Maintenance and it comes out to the almost same cost.

Again, you fail. But thanks for playing.

 

As someone who WORKS in mass transit, I think you're full of it.

The bus needs a paid driver, The price of fuel, oil and maintenance is often much more than a car. Plus the specialized facility needed to maintain it, or did you tink they just leave them in a parking lot somewhere. Then you have to pay the fuelers and cleaners, the dispatchers, the specialists from fare box technicians and computer experts to deal with software problems to specially trained mechanics.

Of course it's subsidized so your fellow citizens are forced to pay for your bus ride even if they never use their service. Real fair there.

Of course, you still have parking to deal with where you left your car to get the bus or, if you go from home, you walk and wait for the bus to show up on it's schedule, rather than just leave and go directly, so there's your time cost. You can also end up worrying about other people getting on the bus who may be drunk, dangerous or just plain nuts particularly with local lines and sporting events. And if you don't think that's a common occurance you're delusional.

Yeah, I can see the convenience and savings. And let's find out this... what's the percentage of people who use mass transit to go to an event? If it's more than 10% I'd be stunned.

Thank you for playing? I'd thank you to make sense. But my hopes aren't high for you.

About as much as a flight.

Even at only 17mpg x 3.50/gal, I could go there and back on 10 gallons = $35

The distance between Paris and Rome is how far? The population density is how great along that route? What is the ACTUAL price without subsidization of the ticket? What is the ridership for that trip?

All these things are factors on whether or not the endeavor is possible because it's profitable enough to stay in business.

Rail started dying worldwide with the invention and mass production of the car. It was still good for long distance travel till the creation of commercial air travel. This trend will continue.

The only areas of real growth in rail is in Intermodal freight transportation with RO/RO technology (that's Roll On/Roll Off) where containers can go from truck to train to ship and new integrated freight hubs.

Florida was very wise to pass on this boondoggle.
 
 
 
I've waited years and I just got dsl in my area.... in 2011 for goodness sakes,....nothing was available to us via land....no dsl and no cable broadband, until this year with the weak dsl service...and I would not have it at all, if it weren't for the gvt subsidizing the telecommunication company for it....we had broadband in 1997 in my area in massachusetts....

sure, they got the money, but they don't always invest it in we the people...

 

And the reason you didn't get it was because it is run by private industry! They made a decision that it wasn't going to make them enough money to justify the expense of getting you high speed internet. This is how the Rightwingers want everything to run.

I think it's better and cheaper for government to handle big infrastructure projects, in the public good. Look at how much internet business and commerce was not done by all the people who are still stuck on dial-up. Amazon.com can't make Verizon or Comcast lay new transmission cable.

There are also a host of ways that local governments have shifted operations to the internet to slim down and save taxpayer money. But you can't utilize that efficiency if most of your citizenry can't effectively access your web content.

They talked, a few years ago, about offering internet service through the electrical grid, run by city utilities. It would have given everyone who had city electric high speed internet, and it would have been cheap. The plan was squashed by Comcast and Embarq lobbyists and money.

Not according to my Guide on Abandoned and Merged railroads I have. It shut down operation in 1978. Amtrak could not make it work because the price for hauling a car plus family was far too expensive.

Edit: I stand corrected... and shocked! It was shut down for decades. Must have decided to try it again. Almost the same route too.

Now the question is, why only that line? If it was a great idea, why can't it go elsewhere. I'm sure a NYC to Chicago, or Los Angeles to Denver route could be very useful. I just doubt the costs could be made low enough and the demand would be there.

Further edit: After checking it out. A one way one person ticket is 93 dollars. The vehicle adds an extra $203. So, are you willing to pay, one way 293 bucks, plus tax to ride the train with your car as added convenience? And just think! That's already federally subsidized prices!

It would improve commerce by making energy costs lower, improve infrastructure by getting many trucks off the highways (trucks do the most damage to roads), and small business would have the benefits of cheaper transportation costs for their goods.
 
 
 
Florida said NO. The lawsuit posed by some against the Governor to force the State to take the funds failed. If some private entity or group of individuals wants to take the risk? Let them. The taxpayers have had enough of big government schemes that end up failing and leave the taxpayers paying for that failure.

/STORY.

 

THAT, my friend, is the heart of the matter.

 

Doesn't the "commerce clause" only relate to interstate, NOT intra-state?
 

Back off, Big Brother

The Auto-Train was a great idea that died because it's practical costs were too great.

 

It's still running, I believe.

 

Not according to my Guide on Abandoned and Merged railroads I have. It shut down operation in 1978. Amtrak could not make it work because the price for hauling a car plus family was far too expensive.

Edit: I stand corrected... and shocked! It was shut down for decades. Must have decided to try it again. Almost the same route too.

Now the question is, why only that line? If it was a great idea, why can't it go elsewhere. I'm sure a NYC to Chicago, or Los Angeles to Denver route could be very useful. I just doubt the costs could be made low enough and the demand would be there.

Further edit: After checking it out. A one way one person ticket is 93 dollars. The vehicle adds an extra $203. So, are you willing to pay, one way 293 bucks, plus tax to ride the train with your car as added convenience? And just think! That's already federally subsidized prices!

 

The Auto-Train Still does run via AMTRAK from Sanford FL., to Lorton Virginia.

I know the old Auto Train you speak of. I used to watch those things speed by here on the old Seaboard Coast Line mainline when I was a teen under the power of GE "U-Boats" (U36B's)...

 Amtrak - Routes - Northeast - Auto Train 

 

I think it's the best of both worlds. If I could pack my family and my car onto a train in Florida and be in NY seven hours later, driving my own vehicle? That's perfect.

 

Seven hours? Are you talking about HSR or the current system we have?

I wanted to visit my brother in Va Beach from Tampa a few years ago. Having never been on a real train (as opposed to the Disneyland Train), I called Amtrak. The cost alone was prohibitive without adding the car and it was going to take something like 21 hours to go from Tampa to Richmond, Va and then I had to switch to a bus and that was going to take another 4 hours, if I am not mistaken.

Well, I drove instead which takes 14 hours... I know, I drove it yesterday.

So, imagine the same crash at almost 4 times the speed, and then factor in that momentum is the square of the velocity. That makes the potential 14 times as bad as going 80.

Could be... But just think of the up-charge that will be coming for hauling that much weight. Regional Autotrains would be a nice experiment (St. Louis to New Orleans run, SF to SD, Denver to Salt Lake City, and Minneapolis to Chicago), though I suspect I know the answer already.

You'd have to average at least 150mph and do it cheaply enough to compete with airlines effectively while making sure you do it significantly faster than driving it yourself. That's a narrow moving target to hit here. Regardless, I'd prefer to see a private company do it, and don't think the technology or advantage is there.

You will never see 300mph rail in this nation until you go maglev, and that is an entirely different system with incredible costs to construct. You think it's expensive to build roads, let alone railroads? You've not seen anything yet. The TRACK is essentially half the motor.

Secondly, there is the problem of geography. You've got towns to worry about, grade crossings, elevating track, tunnels, bridges, switching, equipment yards and all the infrastructure you would see in a railroad, plus the maintenance of the track which will be extreme in comparison because one bad magnet could cause a disaster akin to multiple airliner crashes. And then... you have to idiot proof and protect the damn thing so kids don't try to do stupid stuff (let alone real acts of terrorism) like put rocks in the track or who knows what else they'll think of.

Although Maglev is an awesome technology... it's cost is ludicrously high as compared to improving air transportation.

Railroads haven't been funded by the government since the great westward expansions ended in the beginning of the 1900's.

Government even then never paid directly for their building, offering instead incentives for work previously done. The reason for the incentive was because till connected to the opposite coast, there was little money to be made at the time either when there were no settlements of significance or developed resources to haul back. The towns followed the railroads 90% of the time, not the other way around. They were only paid after the fact for completed rail portions. That is also why the Central Pacific built into Nevada even though the Cape Horn pass and tunnel was not done. When it was done, they got a huge check for suddenly getting hundreds of miles of contiguous track AND it gained them control of line that the UP would have otherwise gained.

Lastly, railroads are all considered private property. Go walk on them and get caught by a cop You will be dinged for tresspassing on private property.

Roads and railroads are not equivalent. I'm all for building highways with federal dollars on the interstate system. All others need to be built by their individual state. That is an enumerated power. Railroads and airports? Nope. Not by the feds.

Please quit trying to blur the lines.

No no... they did a little more than that. An alternating mile on either side of the track was also given to the railroads (The original request was 10 miles on BOTH sides), which they often sold for massive profits. They were also provided a small subsidy to assist with the costs of building the line based on contiguous working track miles and issued quarterly or yearly. Government surveyors were constantly coming out and checking the work.

You should read Stephen Ambrose "Nothing Like It On Earth" about the construction of the Transcontinental railroad. Fascinating book. He doesn't spend time focusing on the corruption and scandal, like the Credit Mobilier and the Oakes brothers. Nor the Big Four's manipulation of California business and politics. He focuses on the act and what it took to get the job done.

From Ted Judah to Abraham Lincoln's railroad law days to presidency, Brigham Young and the mormon work force in Utah, the record track laying effort done by han to the golden spike being driven in not by dignitaries but men who knew how to swing a sledgehammer.

I am a rail fan. A foamer really. It pains me to say that passenger rail is dead in it's current forms, but fact is fact. It just can't compete at this time.

Roads and railroads are not equivalent. I'm all for building highways with federal dollars on the interstate system. All others need to be built by their individual state. That is an enumerated power. Railroads and airports? Nope. Not by the feds.

Please quit trying to blur the lines.

 

Indeed. The only thing that Government insured were the LAND GRANTS...the real estate that the Railroads were built upon...

 

No no... they did a little more than that. An alternating mile on either side of the track was also given to the railroads (The original request was 10 miles on BOTH sides), which they often sold for massive profits. They were also provided a small subsidy to assist with the costs of building the line based on contiguous working track miles and issued quarterly or yearly. Government surveyors were constantly coming out and checking the work.

You should read Stephen Ambrose "Nothing Like It On Earth" about the construction of the Transcontinental railroad. Fascinating book. He doesn't spend time focusing on the corruption and scandal, like the Credit Mobilier and the Oakes brothers. Nor the Big Four's manipulation of California business and politics. He focuses on the act and what it took to get the job done.

From Ted Judah to Abraham Lincoln's railroad law days to presidency, Brigham Young and the mormon work force in Utah, the record track laying effort done by han to the golden spike being driven in not by dignitaries but men who knew how to swing a sledgehammer.

I am a rail fan. A foamer really. It pains me to say that passenger rail is dead in it's current forms, but fact is fact. It just can't compete at this time.

 

*concur* and oversight.

And So am I a Railfan.

 Florida Loses $2.4 Billion For High-Speed Trains 

 
The project, which would have connected Tampa and Orlando with high-speed trains, was rejected by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican. He said he didn't want to obligate the state to pay for what could be expensive operating costs for the line.

However, the Florida Department of Transportation on Wednesday released a study showing the line connecting Tampa to Orlando would have had an operating surplus in 2015, its first year of operation.

 

This is what happens when you have a governor who runs the state like businessman and a very bad one at that, instead of like a politician. There would have been job creation in this but Repugs never promised job creation in their campaigns did they? Its clear they don't fucking care.

 

High speed rail, light rail and other transportation schemes do not work. First, cost over runs in construction are inevitable. Then there are the opertaing costs which are NEVER covered by the fares collected. All mass transit is eventually subsidized by additional taxes. AMTRAK loses....no BLEEDS money every fiscal year. This is subsidized by vehicle fuel taxes which are supposed to go toward road construction and repair. Instead, the money is stolen to pay for pet projects in districts held by powerful legislators.
Obama promised $50 billion for HSR....HUH? At $100 million per mile that gets you a ride you could spit farther.
Example....Charlotte, NC built a 10 mile light rail train. The cost ONE BILLION DOLLARS....Or $100 million per mile.
Jobs? Please. Just more government employment and union thuggery. Not on our watch.
BTW, the governors of both New York and New Jersey will be sending the government on their way same as Florida. Nobody wants this shit because the states will get stuck with the cost of finishing and then operating the trains at a huge loss.
I like rail travel. I am fascinated by it. I wish there were an efficient and convenient way to travel by rail. However, as with anything government does, it is expensive and inefficient. And of course loaded with bureaucracy and red tape.
We have enough to worry about without involving ourselves in building a rail system which few will use and all will have to absorb the costs.
 
 
 
 
 
No fucking proof just all talk, shut the fuck up.

 

From my POV I would not be packing up my car going to find a parking lot to pay for, getting on a train at what ever cost, getting on a train getting off finding and loading a cab to go to a resort when I can do it for less money and in less time less hassle by my own car.
Thats not proof, but it is the fact and you can multiply that by 2 million for the people in my community we may live in florida but we aint stupid.

 

Great. More rail for us in California. I'd much rather travel by train than drive from SF to LA or San Diego. Having traveled throughtout Europe on rail I look forward to the day one can travel from downtown Sacramento or San Francisco to downtown LA without the hassle of gridlock on freeways, $5 a gallon gas and the wear on tires, engine and transmission.
Instead of sitting behind the wheel I can sit and have a meal, read a book, surf the web or play a game of chess; have a cold one in the bar, meet new people and share information on places to go and things to do.
Building rail will provide jobs, long term and permanent, and save oil by moving people and products around our nation lowering consumer costs; anyone who shops for grocery's or any other product knows that the spike in fuel prices raises the cost of everything transported.

 

Ok..Planing routes for rights of way, buying expensive real estate, environmental concerns. lawsuits, NIMBY's, designing locomotives/cars, traversing roadways, prohibition of at grade crossings. Then there is construction. Construction delays, cost over runs, union strikes, bureaucracy....Do you see where we're going here.
Rail works great if there is a way to get people t their destinations and each destination is within walking distance or has a local transit link. Rail is useless for leisure travel where people need to travel to destinations far from the rail stations. That means one must load their luggage into a car, drive to the train station( in most cities train stations are in the worst crime ridden areas of town) unload luggage then ride the train. They then must load their luggage into another auto and go to their destination. This process must be repeated again for the return trip. If one drives, they load twice and unload twice. If they ride the train they unload and load 8 times. What do they do in the event of inclement weather?
Look, we have air travel which is cheaper than trains and much faster. And one must do the same thing. Unload and load luggage several times. Given the choice, people will fly. Even though it is a hassle.
Trains? Great idea in theory. In practice, not so good.

Oh yea, "high speed trains" are evidence of "usurpation of LIBERTY". I forgot that part. Seems I left my "looniness" at home. Thanks for bringing yours.

 

it is when there's NO market for it, and TAXPAYERS will ultimately be forced to pay for something they will never USE unless forced to.

Right...gotcha'. Keep up the fight Deany-Bub...    

 

and how the fuck will they be forced to dumb drunk?
All of a sudden is the world market on oil going to go, HAHAH i know what we can do, We can raise prices in oil and force people to ride trains! Yeah we are evil!

You are a stupid fuck.

 

The trains will need to be subsidized. That means those who do not use the trains will have their taxes increased, whether it be fuel taxes, property taxes or local sales taxes. All of which by the way are done in New York to subsidize the fares paid by subway riders as well as Metro- North commuter trains.
SO you see, no one is actually forced to use the trains, they are simply forced to pay for them through additional taxation.
Tell ya what, you can have your trains. Just as long as the riders pay the full cost of using them.
User fees instead of taxes.

I remember you used to be able to buy that train for an HO set from Tyco back in the day! NE Wisconsin wasn't very good railroading territory. You had the Chicago & Northwestern and Soo Line. Before I was born we had Milwaukee Road and Green Bay Western, but that was it.

Then it became the Wisconsin Central for about a decade and now it's all Canadian National.  

I miss short lines and regional haulers

At least in the twin cities I get BNSF, CN, CP, Soo Line, UP, Minnesota Commercial, Twin Cities & Western and a few other local short lines. Plus when I was driving school kids, I'd see Amtrak's Empire Builder come in early in the morning, and of course the Metro Transit's Northstar commuter line.

BTW if you're a rail photography fan, look for books by Don Ball Jr. Some fantastic work. My personal favorite is O. Winston Link, but I can only find him in Calendar form nowadays with the "Steel and Steam" series.

I am a huge fans of trains. If I could ride a train to wherever I need to go, I'd leave the car in the driveway.
My wife an I are train enthusiasts. We've been on several train excursions and visited three train museums. Doing the Alaska Railroad and the Rocky Mountain run in Canada are on our bucket list. We've been on the rail excursion in NC where the train crash scene was shot for the Harrison Ford film "The Fugitive".
I think rail travel would be a great idea. However government simply cannot be trusted to get it done on time and under budget. So why waste the money? Who knows why anyone would ignore the past, do the same things and expect a different result.

I hate trains. Well, freight trains anyway. If there is one thing I would like to see before I die it is the bankruptcy papers for CSX Railroad. I can't even begin to guess how many productive hours I and the men and women of the Tampa Bay Area have lost over the past 12 years because those arrogant bastards block the road in Tampa while switching tracks pulling across the highway so that the last car is almost to the highway and then backing up until the locomotive gets back to the highway, stopping and waiting. Bankruptcy is too good for those SOB's.

And why the hell do they have to do this at traffic time for goodness sake?

 A Florida Department of Transportation study  shows the line could have had an operating surplus in 2015, its first year of operation. The Miami Herald  reported  on the findings earlier this month: The study showed the line would have had a $28.6 million surplus in its 10th year. The numbers are more optimistic than a 2009 study, which concluded the line would have not seen an operating surplus until 2021.

The $1.3 million study, conducted by the forecasting firms Wilbur Smith Associates and Steer Davies Gleave, shows the line would have had 3.3 million riders in its first year. The previous analysis predicted the line would have had 2.4 million riders in 2015.

Other states, like New York and California, have already expressed interest in taking the money for their own high-speed rail projects.

I saw that report before... maybe it was even posted by you?

It came from FDOT. The thought that they could actually get a project done on time let alone under budget is so far fetched it is not even worth the bandwidth it took to read it twice.

And the number of riders? 3.3 million... I have only one thing to say about that... bullshit. Sorry, but that is the nicest I can be about their analysis.

3.3 million riders? Shit. With all the buses, light and heavy commuter rail in the twin cities, we only get around 7 million rides a year. A single line from Tampa to Orlando's going to pull down around half that???? And ridership covers less than 40% of the cost to operate too.

Horseshit indeed.

I see the Orlando-Tampa line being all about tourism, and is a big boost to Busch Gardens, especially, although the Mouse will quickly figure out how to get all those St. Pete retirees, Tampa/Clearwater young people, and British tourists comfortably over to the Magic Kingdom. Perhaps a direct monorail from the train station.  

Now, that's clearly a 'giveaway' to the theme parks, and if it was so important then those parks would finance it themselves...yadda, yadda,...

But does it benefit Florida? Yes!
Will it result in fuller hotels? Yes!
Does Florida receive a nice hotel tax? Yes!

Will Florida receive more revenue because of it? Yes!

Does that mean these businesses will hire more people, who will in turn pay income tax, contributing to the system instead of draining it, and once again becoming consumers? Yes!

And what does this cost? A few billion? I say build it, get our feet wet, learn from it, get it cheaper and better, and utilize it to it's 'highest and best use' across the country.

I see the Orlando-Tampa line being all about tourism, and is a big boost to Busch Gardens, especially, although the Mouse will quickly figure out how to get all those St. Pete retirees, Tampa/Clearwater young people, and British tourists comfortably over to the Magic Kingdom.

Now, that's clearly a 'giveaway' to the theme parks, and if it was so important then those parks would finance it themselves...yadda, yadda,...

Living just outside of Tampa, I disagree with you. I don't see people flying in to Tampa so that they can take the train to Orlando and with all the Amusement Parks in Orlando, I do not see people going to Disney and then taking the train to Tampa just so they can go to Busch Gardens. That simply isn't going to happen.

Driving through Lakeland has not been much of a problem since they widened I-4.

I do not expect the hotels to be any fuller than they are now. The restaurants won't be any fuller either. People are not going to come to Orlando simply because there is HSR between Tampa and Orlando.

What will it cost? A few billion dollars that the U.S. Government should not be throwing away at the moment.

Tampa gets a lot of British tourism. Always has. These folks drive on the other side, and are not comfortable driving in America, generally. Right now, they take tour buses to Disney.

They would be one type of customer.

The Tampa Bay and Orlando areas have a HUGE amount of younger people, under 35. A HS train would be a very attractive thing for this group to hit each other's cities for weekend fun. Just can't be too strict with the security: people want to bring their weed with them on these getaways.

That would be second type of customer.

Old People in St. Petersburg: again, tour buses if they want to go anywhere in Orlando. Maybe not a huge market for Disney, but it sure makes it easier when their children's families come to visit from Ohio and want to see the Mouse.

That would be a third type of customer.

This would be a big boost to the Tampa Port, also. More people from Orlando would take the HS train to get to cruise ships without having to pay a daily parking charge for their car, or rent a one-way from Orl-TB.

That would be a guaranteed fourth type of customer.
 
 
I just checked the Tampa Port website. Cruise parking is $14 per day.

Yup - guaranteed.
 
 
 
 
 
 Florida Loses $2.4 Billion For High-Speed Trains 

This is what happens when you have a governor who runs the state like businessman and a very bad one at that, instead of like a politician. There would have been job creation in this but Repugs never promised job creation in their campaigns did they? Its clear they don't fucking care.

 

nah. he's running it like a politician. he's having wet dreams about being president

 

There's no way this guy will ever be President:

So because of the fantasy train thousands more people will magically appear in Orlando and Tampa JUST because of the existence of the rail line. Oh please.
This is typical of those who are comfortable spending other people's money for their own reasons and schemes.
So, where are all these people who will fill the restaurants and hotels come from?
By claiming a government project will expand an economy plays right into the failed notion of Kensyian economic policy.
The following is guaranteed. People will NIT flock to ride the trains. There will be NO additional people making special trips from out of state to ride the trains to tourist attractions. The cost to build and maintain the trains will far exceed the original price tag. Far fewer people will ride the trains than the estimates the train supporters publish. The trains will LOSE money.
How is it I can state this? Because every single one of these type rail systems lose money, cost far more than originally published and far fewer users ride the trains than original estimates. Every single one.
Typical liberalism. Keep doing the same things over and again while expecting a different result.

That would be a guaranteed fourth type of customer.

 

Customer #1: We don't get that many that I know of. If they want to go to Disney, they fly into Orlando. That won't change. Maybe they decide to go to the beach for the day? Daytona Beach is much closer to Orlando and more well known.

I certainly do not see these riders as filling one train a year combined.

Customer #2: Again, I don't see it filling a single train all year. Most people who are old enough to drive and live in Tampa have cars and are not going to give up that convenience in order to take a train that will cost more money for the ticket (before adding the cost of parking at the station) than it will to drive themselves. And during non-commute hours, when most of these people would be traveling, they are not going to save anytime because they are going to have to wait for the trains in the first place.

Customer #3: Don't tell all the grandma's that I said this, but people use Disney to get away from Grandma for the day.   Again, if they are in town and it is not commute time, they are not going to take the train that will cost them more time and money than there own cars. From Tampa to Orlando is an hours drive. It simply will not be worth the time/money/inconvenience to take the train and give up the car and the liberty to do as you please when you get there.

Customer #4: Disney is a week's vacation by itself and that is not even seeing half of it. I don't see many people being able to take two to three week vacations at a time. Generally, they are lucky if they can pull together a week at a time. I love to cruise. I enjoy Disney, but it just doesn't work to do both on the same vacation. People taking a cruise out of Tampa, will fly to TIA, get on the shuttle and go to the port. They are not going to be able to fly to Orlando, enjoy Disney even just one park and then take the train to Tampa to take a cruise. I simply don't see it happening.

And, all that aside, that does not change the fact, that our government needs to cut spending. If HSR is such a boon-doggle, then some corporate conglomerate, i.e. Disney will pick up the tab. Why haven't they yet? Because they know it is a losing proposition for them... now, if they could only get Uncle Sam to foot the bill...  

Immie
 
 
 
I just checked the Tampa Port website. Cruise parking is $14 per day.

Yup - guaranteed.

 

Most people from out of town who go on cruises don't bring their cars. Many fly in, take the shuttle to the port, get on the ship and cruise away. No $14/day parking fee. Cab fair is something like $20 per cab, if I remember correctly from the time last year I picked my brother up at the port when he got home. Definitely not cheaper than HSR which would be per person from Orlando.

People who live close enough to drive are better off renting a car from Avis one way. Dropping their car off at the airport and taking the shuttle or a cab from the airport to the port and cruising away.

Hi ya'll! Im from Cocoa Beach FL and I work over seas on Ascension Island supporting our American space intrests.

Anyhow, im new here.

I grew up on the east coast of FL and I would have really liked to see a high speed railroad, we need it. The space program is in peril and this area of FL could have used this influx of federal income. Shame on the GOP, once again. ugh.

First;  

Second;
That's a very self-centered point of view.
Florida does NOT need the Fed, or the other 49 states, to throw billions of dollars down a rabbit hole for a select few individuals.

We all see how splendid of a job the Gov't has done with Amtrak.

HSR from Miami to Orlando to Tampa is a complete and utter waste of taxpayer dollars. The only value of HSR is if it can get people long distances in a short amount of time, saving them time and money. The drive from Tampa to Orlando is no more than 1.5 hours (2.5 if you are elderly and drive 45mph in the fast lane as some do) and from Tampa to Miami roughly 4 hours. There would be little time savings on this route and unless the government highly subsidized ticket prices, meaning taxpayers fund it, there would be no savings of money either when you factor in parking.

HSR would be a wonderful thing to have if it could get us across the country in 15 hours, but that will never happen.

This proposal is a waste of tax dollars.

Like I said yesterday in this thread, if it was worth the expense, you can bet a corporate conglomerate, such as Disney, would have already done this. They have not because they know it holds no value, but Disney would be thrilled to death if they could get the government to foot the bill.

Uncle Sam is in no shape to gamble with our tax dollars at the moment.

Smart move Florida !!!
You avoided a boondogle if it had worked out like our light rail in Houston.
Price per mile started at 46 million per MILE !!!!! Thats right 46 Mili per mile !!!!!
That was in 1999....two short years later it went to 70 million per mile !!!!!
At this point the tax payers went apeshit !!! But no need to worry said Metro, it will pay for itself.
Pay for itself?? Yeah right. As of now ridership pays for 1/3 of operating cost !!
And this going to pay for it how ?
We took the train to a Texans game (after driving 25 miles)just to see what all the hoopla was about. Well let me say this,the train was actually pretty cool. But as we took the trip to the stadiun I noticed people getting on and off the train without a ticket.
I'm thinking to myself....i'm a newb at this public transpo thing I must be missing something.
Come to find out later that the train works on the honor system !!!! WTF You run a train through the inner city and expect honor?
All brought to you by our liberal mayors.....Like I said smart move Florida !!!!

Try $100 million per mile..That's right. Charlotte, NC's 10 mile light rail system cost ONE BILLION DOLLARS...While ridership has come within 20% of the initial estimates, the rail line comes no where near paying for itself. in fact it heavily subsidized by a one cent sales tax, federal grants and the state siphons money from the state highway fund to pay off the debt. Nonsense.

Damn !! And I thought we were getting screwed !!!! But at least you came within 20% of expected ridership.   We never got close.
The part that really got me was the honor system BS ! Did they really think they could run a train through the inner city and expect people to pay on the "honor system"?
Or did they know damn good and well that they were going to give a free ride to the underprivileged(see lazy and dishonest)riders?

I give Scott props for even showing up, though. Crist did not make one appearance in years past, and of course Jeb didn't, either.
