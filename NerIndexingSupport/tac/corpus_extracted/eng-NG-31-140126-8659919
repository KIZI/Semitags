The Dolphins have a chance to go on a nice little run here with games
against NYJ, Oak, Hous and Clev.

Cheer up its NYJ week.

I don't want to be the pessimist, but NY always gives Miami problems
no matter how good Miami is and how bad NY is. I don't see why next
week will be any different and Houston is actually looking pretty good
so far.

I know Miami's D shouldn't be as bad as Cincy's, but did you see how
many points Cleveland put up yesterday?

I hope they turn it around. It's just hard to be pumped right now.

It is a long off-season.  Try to enjoy the team while they are here.

I thought we had the Boys' after going up 13-10.  The "D" started to
show some teeth, the passing game looked unstoppable and Ronnie Brown
was able to find holes for nice gains. The TSN turning point was the
illegal formation penalty on Jason Allen.  Crayton ripped off a long
return on th re-kick and the rest is history.

Some positives:
The O-line looks good in pass blocking situations for the most part.
Chris Chambers and Trent Green having some early season chemistry.
No big time dropped passes.
The pass "D" was great for the most part.

Yeah?

I can't recall the last time the Dolphins made short work of the
Jets.  When they've beaten the Jets, they've struggled to do so.
Oakland is taking their games to the wire - the Broncos needed OT to
win yesterday.  Assuming Culpepper is the starter, do you think he'll
have a "bone on" for the Dolphins?  I would be okay with that if our
pass rush was getting any sort of pressure on the QB's... but haven't
seen any of note so far.  Sad fucking thing if Daunte has his best
game of the season against this latest version of the Dolphin's
defense.

I believe Houston is 2 - 0 and they thumped Carolina pretty soundly
yesterday.  In any case, the Texans sure weren't a "soft spot" for
Miami last year or opening day the year before that and absolutely
won't be this year.  Speaking of soft spots, the last time this team
went to Cleveland thinking that they'd beat that Browns team like a
drum, they got their asses handed to them.  After watching this team
play yesterday, I'd say that the Dolphins are looking like the soft
spot on the schedule for teams like Oakland and Cleveland - not the
other way around.

Grumpy old men?

What gives?  You wait 8 months for the Miami dolphins football season
to begin, and after 14 days you think the season is over.
The fact of the matter is the Dolphins are 0-2 not 2-0.  Losses to
Dallas and Washington (who appear to be the class of the NFC East)
hurt, but they certainly don't end our season.

Besides, the Dolphins had a chance to win in both games (despite the
final score in Dallas).

The Dolphins have 12 in-conference games which includes 6 division
games, begining this week with the NYJ.

Need a few more positives to cheer you up?

Vernon Carrey appears to be the best LT in Miami since Richmond Webb.
Chambers is on pace for a career best 120 catched and 1600
yards...yikes.

Still need more...

You've got to be kidding re the Dallas game.  After our opening drive
in the third quarter it was lights out.  No rational observer could
have believed we were going to win that game.

 

Isn't that much more of a statement how pathetic our LT's have been
since Webbie went to Cinci?  Vernon appears servicable to me,
definitely not Pro Bowl stock.  Do you actually see otherwise?

 

OK, (lights come on!), now I get it.  Funny post, you had me going

I don't recall any easy Dolphin wins against the Jets.  :-(

Both teams are 0 - 2 going into this game.  Obviously, one of the two
is likely going to be 0 - 3 - except for the unlikely chance of a tie.

It would be nice to see the Dolphins truly "bring it" this week -
something I contend they have not done thus far.  You would think
seeing the Jets limp in to town would inspire them to take advantage.
I haven't seen any real fire from this team yet, so I won't be
predicting that.  In fact, my "vision" is that we will see them
sleepwalk through another loss.  Cynical?  You bet.

What do you mean?  The defense made Dallas punt every drive they
started from inside the Dallas 40 (including in the 4th quarter) and
held Dallas to field goals twice when Dallas started at the 50 or
closer.    Here are the starting positions of the Cowboys TD drives:

* Dallas 40
* Miami 30
* Miami 39
* Miami 40

If offense and special teams had done a better job Miami is in the
game (they nailed that punt first punt in the 3rd quarter but Jason
Allen gave Dallas a second try).  I'm not saying that Miami would have
prevented all Dallas TDs but it would have been a contest.

I think your perception is skewed by years of the Dolphins having an
elite defense.  The defense is not elite this year (despite
predictions to the contrary) but it doesn't have to be elite for the
Dolphins to win IF the offense and special teams can play relatively
mistake free and perform at an average or slightly above average
level.

 

If you were hoping for the Dolphins to win the SB then I guess you
need to believe that our LT is probowl caliber.

I was merely hoping for an incremental improvement resulting in a
winning record and a wild card playoff berth.  From what I've seen so
far, It is not Vernon Carey who is letting the team down.

Given that last years division champion Eagles and Saints are both 0-2
this year the Dolphins have some good company.  My point isn't that
the Dolphins are going to do as well as either of these team but
rather that getting off to a good start is not easy, even when you are
a proven winner.

Take a deep breath.  Relax.  You might as well try to be optimistic
about Cameron because there is no way Wayne "I wanted Saban to stay"
Huizenga is going to give Cameron and Mueller the boot after one
season and who can say he is wrong?  Would you have fired Bill Walsh,
Bill Belichick or Jimmy Johnson after their first dismal seasons as
head coach of franchises that went on to greatness?

Cameron will probably be around for at least 3 years.  No coach is
perfect -- they all make mistakes.  Lets hope that Cameron learns
quickly so the Dolphins can make us fans proud again in the near
future.

Let's instead look at the complete picture, as unfortunately, one
cannot
seperate offensive ineptitude and defensive ineptitude, as the fins
certainly blew in both dimensions.

09:41 3 01:46 DAL 29 5 13 Punt
05:55 3 01:14 MIA 30 3 30 Touchdown
03:44 3 01:34 MIA 15 4 5 Field Goal

09:17 4 03:01 DAL 24 3 9 Punt
05:44 4 01:43 MIA 39 4 39 Touchdown
03:26 4 00:09 MIA 40 1 40 Touchdown
02:53 4 01:08 MIA 30 4 6 Downs

Really impressive, no?  That fourth quarter punt we forced was truly a
stop
of the ages.  We did stop them twice, so at least they didn't bat
1.0000.

 

But they obviously didn't, hence my point.
"IF" Roger Craig had a bowling ball sized hemorrhoid, Marino would
have a Super Bowl ring...

Granted, it is the NFL and the margins between winner and loser are
slim, but that makes execution all that much more important if, like
Miami, you don't have a personnel advantage...

 

That is your opinion, unfortunately you really don't bolster it with
facts or reality.  What is it about our offense that makes you feel
that way?  I believe our D has to play out of their heads for Miami to
do any better than 8-8.

Nor have I ever claimed Miami had an "elite" D.  Baltimore had one, as
did Tampa Bay.  Ours has been above average, but there have been too
many second half let downs in the last ten years for me to EVER claim
eliteness, whatever that is.

 

You completely missed the point.  Webb was a ProBowler.  Comparing the
human turnstile Carey to Webb is comical.  Even the later model Webb
who was the human procedure penalty.  And my point about how pathetic
our LTs have been since Rich have been is totally, indisputably valid.

 

Agreed, although he got humiliated in a couple rushes against the
Foreskins, but then, I never said he was.

 

I've been a Dolphins fan since I've been alive.  I was a lower level
season ticket holder for over a decade when I lived in Florida.  If
the Dolphins didn't make stupid mistakes and proved  they were the
best conditioned group
in the stadium (which, until this year, they usually demonstrate
without exception, talent notwithstanding) then I'd be optimistic
about winning more than their share.  Right now, we are miles away
from even being competitive.

Let's leave the Jensonian noncritical attitude to Bob, ok?  ;-)

 

Sorry, but I'm not the oxygen deprived poster in this thread. ;-)

 

Try to avoid strawman arguments and putting words in my mouth if you
want me to take you seriously.

 

When, exactly, did the Browns go on to "greatness"?  I think I missed
it.  Oh, you mean the Pats!  ;-)

Look at the personnel moves JJ made in Dallas in the beginning, or
what Walsh did with what was a laughingstock franchise, and Belichick
has certainly cemented his status as a guru with the moves he made in
NE.  What reminds you of these guys in what Miami is doing TODAY?

 

Cam is a good guy.  His draft can't be fully evaluated until we see
what Beck is all about.  If Beck doesn't make it then HUGE pressure is
on Ginn to prove he isn't a bust, but I am still hoping against hope
he gets into a groove soon.  If Ginn never pans out but Beck starts
for five or more seasons then I think Cam gets the benefit here.

Season after season of shit drafting and shit draft pick trades has
caught up with Miami BIG TIME. We'll win a few, may even get our
annual V over NE, but Cam inherits a sparce and aging pantry.  It
isn't all his fault, but until a disciplined team that AT LEAST plays
to their ability shows up, I'll have trouble getting optimistic.

With that said, we're beating the Jests this week.

After todays display of ineptitude I have to agree with you.  My God,
where the hell did Cameron learn clock management?  Given what we saw
last year in the NE vs SD playoff game and this year against the
'Skins and the Jets Cameron has got to be the worst clock manager
ever.  The margin of loss against the Jets was 3 points.  Thanks to
Cameron's idiot play calling the Jets got at least 4 more points (TD
vs field goal) and possibly 7 more points just before the half.  Run
the ball between the tackles twice and throw once into the endzone
before kicking and the Jets have much less time and the end of the
half, that and demand that your special teams do their job and do a
real kick off rather than a squib.

 

I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that :^)

 

what is the weakened argument I was attacking verses the stronger one
you put forth?

 

No, the Browns continued to Suck after Belichick.  My point is that
even with the draft, these guys first seasons were stinkers.  It takes
a while for those new players to adjust to the NFL and make an
impact.  It also takes luck.  Is Belichick the NE coach that much
smarter than Belichick the CLE coach?  No, he is just luckier.  Like a
poker player on a hot streak, sometimes coaches and personnel guys get
lucky.  If they happen to get lucky and be good coaches then SB rings
ensue.

 

Agreed.  Ginn certainly hasn't shown much.  Given the way TV producers
direct games it is hard to see how good or bad the Dolphins special
teams players around Ginn are playing.  If we judge their skill by how
good/bad the kickoff coverage team is playing then we can assume they
suck and are limiting Ginn's ability to create (optimism, I know).

If Beck and the new O-linemen work out then we are making small
improvements.

 

I hear you.

Coming back to my point that Miami's defense, while mediocre was not
the weakest link in the first two games:  Chicago, which arguably has
one of the better defenses, gave up 131 yards rushing and 431 total
yards to Dallas (along with falling slightly short of Miami's 5 turn
over mark) -- not as bad as Miami's performance but suggestive that
even a top notch defense has trouble stopping Dallas if they don't
have an offense to score some points and give the D a rest (DAL-CHI
ToP was 35 to 25 minutes -- almost identical to the MIA - DAL game).

Coming back to the MIA - NYJ game this week; Why the heck can Miami
not adjust at half time and do better than the opposition in the 3rd
quarter?

It has to be gut wrenching for the players to know that Cameron's
lousy end of the 1st half play calling was s critical link in the
chain of mistakes leading to defeat.  Sure, the defense stunk again
(getting your butt kicked by Dallas' offense is one thing, getting it
kicked by the 0-2 Jets is another).

Oh well, enjoy thinking about who are are going to select with the
first pick of the 2008 draft...
