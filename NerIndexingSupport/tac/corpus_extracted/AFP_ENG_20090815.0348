President Gloria Arroyo on Saturday called for the "annihilation" of Muslim
extremists from the southern Philippines after a bloody battle left 23 soldiers
dead.

"The war against terror must be pursued. The annihilation of the Abu Sayyaf must
be done," Defence Secretary Gilbert Teodoro quoted Arroyo as saying.

She also warned that members of the Muslim separatist Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), who joined in the slaughter of the soldiers, would be hunted down
despite a ceasefire with the rebel group, Teodoro said.

The president made the remarks in a command conference in Zamboanga, where she
visited wounded soldiers and attended the wake of the troopers killed fighting
the Abu Sayyaf Muslim extremists on southern Basilan island on Thursday.

Teodoro warned that the government also knew which MILF groups had aided the Abu
Sayyaf in the fighting and warned that the government would go after them as
well.

"Those who were involved in the attacks will also be included among those to be
neutralised and arrested," he said, referring to the MILF.

"There are cases we have already filed against them and we have filed protests,"
with the international group monitoring the government's ceasefire with the
MILF, Teodoro told reporters.

Some 23 soldiers and 20 Abu Sayyaf members were killed when the military overran
a training camp run by the militants on Basilan.

MILF fighters have been identified as helping the Abu Sayyaf in the fighting
despite having a ceasefire with the government. Press reports say the rebels
mutilated the bodies of the slain soldiers.

Teodoro warned the MILF leadership that if they attempt to use the peace process
to shield their fighters who took part in the violence, "then they are
countenancing this illegal activity".

However he said operations against the MILF in Basilan should not affect efforts
to revive the peace talks. "We know their command and control in Basilan is
loose and the leaders there make their own decisions," he said.

Teodoro did not say that additional forces would be sent to Basilan to help in
the operations against the extremists but he stressed that the government side
had the "momentum" against the rebels as they had just captured a major Abu
Sayyaf camp.

The Abu Sayyaf, formed in the early 1990s with support from Al-Qaeda leader
Osama bin Laden, has been linked to the worst terror attacks in Philippine
history, including deadly bombings and mass kidnappings.

The larger MILF has been waging an Islamic separatist campaign in the southern
Philippines for 30 years but five years ago they signed a ceasefire with the
government to negotiate for peace.

Although the peace talks collapsed in August, 2008 after MILF commanders
attacked Christian communities in the south, both sides have recently taken
steps to resume the talks.
