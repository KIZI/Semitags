Tax credits work, at least when it comes to
keeping filmmaking in Los Angeles.

Feature film production was up a healthy 11.5 percent this past
April, May and June compared with the second quarter of 2009,
according to the latest report from FilmL.A.

In the three-month period, filmmakers logged a total of 1,542
permitted production days, up from 1,383 last year.

The spike in shooting was even greater if all shoots -- films,
commercials and TV shows -- are included, with overall production
climbing 16 percent in the second quarter over last year.

"We're seeing real results from the state tax incentives,"
said Paul Audley, president of FilmL.A., the nonprofit organization
that processes location shooting permits for the city of Los
Angeles, nearby municipalities and unincorporated county areas.

"It's very good to know that while we're nowhere near the
numbers we used to be at in California, at least we're heading in
the right direction."

More than a quarter of local permitted days for feature films
were tied to the state film and TV tax credit program.

Unlike many states and Canadian provinces, which have employed
similar schemes to attract production for years, California began
issuing tax credits for the first time on July 1, 2009, with the
express idea of keeping certain kinds of productions in state.

L.A. City Councilman Paul Krekorian authored the California
Assembly version of the tax credit bill when he was a state
legislator.

"It was tough sledding for three years for those of us who were
working on this issue," Krekorian said. "And it clearly has had
the impact that we'd hoped. Tremendous job growth, production
increasing, California being more competitive with the rest of the
country and the world -- and that means keeping people here in Los
Angeles at work."

FilmL.A.'s report bolsters that argument and contains some other
good news. The overall number of second quarter permitted
production days for films, TV shows, commercials and other shoots
increased from 9,597 to 11,134 days.

Some numbers are troubling, however. Although commercials grew a
whopping 34.5 percent for the quarter and 47.9 percent for the year
to date, figures still lag behind their prerecession levels.

And television saw a stark 38.2 percent drop in its
highest-spending category, dramas, primarily due to the
cancellations of such heavy location-shooting series as "24" and
"Heroes." Reality shows, on the other hand, spiked up 47.6
percent, but they tend to spend considerably less on production and
generate half as many jobs as dramas.

Total TV production, including sitcoms and pilots, only grew 1.4
percent in the second quarter. Most TV shows don't qualify for
California's narrowly focused tax credit, which explains why it had
a bigger impact on the feature film numbers. Movies with budgets
between $1 million and $75 million are eligible for the incentives.

The program's effect on future local movie production remains to
be seen. The California Film Commission, which awards and
administers the tax credits, was able to OK $200 million of the
subsidies in its first fiscal year. It will only have $100 million
worth of credits to dole out for each of the next three years
unless lawmakers increase funding. Just two weeks into the second
fiscal year, its $100 million is pretty much already exhausted.

"Clearly, there is a demand," CFC President Amy Lemisch said.
"... But I think it's a little frustrating for some productions
because the funding is limited."

Krekorian said that reports like FilmL.A.'s could help increase
the state's commitment to the program.

"It's critically important to document the success of this
incentive." he said. "Doing that makes it much easier for
legislators to make the case for continuing or expanding the
incentive."

"We think it's very, very clear that having put that incentive
in place is the only thing that has really kept California from
losing its share of the film industry to the world," FilmL.A.'s
Audley added.

"I really believe that this is a call to action for the
California Legislature to recognize that this critical and
extremely valuable business for the state must be supported in a
greater way than it is now."
