 No tacos for you! 
 
 
Seriously, get some help.

Ok now this is getting rediculous!! Most foods are ethnic, might as well cut out all Italian foods, french, German, etc. My kid would go bananas if they cut the little pizzas from the menu(greek/italian)!

*Edit* Though the link is not working and can't find anything on it so i may have to retract my statement...

I understand they considered banning apples when the discovered that apples aren't native to the USA.  
 
 
Lame zone material.
 
 
Hot dogs are ethnic food as well.

Where are we going with this racism that does not exist?
Does not exist per some's opinions anyway.

Wait a minute...I was very clearly informed that tacos are not Mexican. They are American.
 
 
they may ban tequilla too.

How about ponchos and sombrerros?

May 13, 2010 TZI (Update) - This morning Arizona's embattled governor signed legislation that banned ethnic foods in the public school system. Among the items on the list are tomatoes, chilies, cilantro, tortillas, avacados, limes, corn, and beans.

In a clarification issued this morning, the governor stated the ban was on bad ethnic food cooked in public school kitchens. In an apparent boon to local fast food establishments and vending machines, it appears school cafeterias will be closed.

Also, tomatoes were removed from the list as they were declared nonethnic specific. A case is also being made for cilantro, corn and beans. There was some hope brocolli COULD be added.

Trouble is that most schools don't allow kids to leave during the school day so the poor dears are going to starve to death.

Come on people! I said brocolli. We are all on the same satire page I believe.
 
 
Don't blame Brewer - blame Michele Obama - ethnic food can and is very fattening. What are they saying about hot dogs, hamburgers, chips, soft drinks, etc.??? Come on people, stop the silliness!

That last line about broccoli should be a dead give away. 1) it's misspelled and 2) it is PURE sarcasm. Dripping sarcasm.

 NeoNazi/AZ GOP connection exposed through Racist Anti Immigrant Law 

In 2007, Pierce was photographed with J.T. Ready spokesman for the National Socialist Movement, better known as the Nazi Party. They refer to themselves, “the premier white civil right organization in the world.” The group claims to be true patriots claiming that they are only against non-white immigration. J.T. Ready has said that closing the borders is crucial to preserving the white race. “Let's face it,” he said. “We're not being invaded by Swedish nuns here. We're on a border with a country that is a hostile country.” Pierce is also known for speaking at Neo-Nazi rallies and conferences.

Just recently in Los Angeles, Neo-Nazi rallied against illegal aliens. They waved American flags and banners with swastikas, wore black military uniforms and helmets. They shouted ‘Sieg Heil’ before each of their members began speaking.

First time I spelled it bracolli in the composition phase. Checked the spelling online and saw it was b-r-o and never checked the c-c-o-l-i part. Sacrasm by default. Dripping sarcasm? I was going for oozing.  
 
 
before we go after Rizo con pollo, which is pretty tasty, we need to ban Thai curry. Which I think is already banned under various weapons of mass destruction control treaties.

There are a couple Korean relishes that are almost as bad for capesin count.
 
 
Reading sarcasm for comprehesion? I don't recommend it. Read it for entertainment. The way the author intended.
 
 
and in a related story: The L.A. Unified School District has banned white bread and mayonnaise.

Well that should take care of the obesity epidemic  
 
 
The way taxes will have to rise for this administration, we might as well get used to Mexican and Korean foods anyway. They have the advantage of being very cheap.

Rice costs like $4.50 per box for 30 servings.

We should avoid tortillias though. Too much fat. Seniora Obama disapproves of fatty foods

I don't think I like the idea of chicken feet for supper.

Good point.  
 
 
 
 

 

That would about accurately describe the situation here. Guess who would be screwed the most if whites boycotted Mexican establishments?
 
 
I wonder what all those Hispanic Republicans think of that?
 
 
 
 

 

Illegal aliens have "government debit" cards and "food stamps"?

What do you want to bet those numbers were pulled out of someone's ass?
 
 
 
I wonder what all those Hispanic Republicans think of that?

 

What Hispanic Republicans? Dude, grow up some day, huh? I actually live here and talk to the Mexican-Americans here. In fact, I comprende espanol.

Mexican Americans against enforcing immigration laws are just screwing themselves and putting their relatives ahead of their brains. LEGAL immigrants and/or Tejanos pay US taxes. THEY foot the bill for the slug illegals and job losses and unpaid medical bills SAME AS WHITES.

You should have slapped your other hand for even touching the keyboard you dork.  
 
 
 
 
 

 

Illegal aliens have "government debit" cards and "food stamps"?

What do you want to bet those numbers were pulled out of someone's ass?

 

Illegal aliens cannot be denied medical care. They can drop their anchor babies and have at our social infrastructure. They get paid under the table so they don't pay INTO the infrastructure they are sucking dry.

How hard is that? Even for a brain dead fuck like you?
 
 
 
 
 

 

Illegal aliens have "government debit" cards and "food stamps"?

What do you want to bet those numbers were pulled out of someone's ass?

 

Do you actually know how to read, or do you just fake it? Please point out to me exactly where in that fake article it says that illegal aliens were involved in the boycott. It says "local Hispanic leaders."

I keep saying, why don't we just adopt Mexico's own immigration law?

At a time when the Supreme Court and many politicians seek to bring American law in line with foreign legal norms, it's noteworthy that nobody has argued that the U.S. look at how Mexico deals with immigration and what it might teach us about how best to solve our illegal immigration problem. Mexico has a single, streamlined law that ensures that foreign visitors and immigrants are:

- in the country legally;
- have the means to sustain themselves economically;
- not destined to be burdens on society;
- of economic and social benefit to society;
- of good character and have no criminal records; and
- contributors to the general well-being of the nation.

The law also ensures that:
- immigration authorities have a record of each foreign visitor;
- foreign visitors do not violate their visa status;
- foreign visitors are banned from interfering in the country's internal politics;
- foreign visitors who enter under false pretenses are imprisoned or deported;
- foreign visitors violating the terms of their entry are imprisoned or deported;
- those who aid in illegal immigration will be sent to prison.

 Immigration Reform? Let's Try Mexico's Immigration Law!

It isn't a matter of policy. We HAVE immigration laws. We don't enforce them.
 
 
I'm suggesting this because having a law which mirrors Mexico's (which is tougher than the combined laws in the U.S.), should take the wind out of anyone's argument that we are somehow being discriminatory. Mexican immigrants objecting to a law which treats them the way their own country treats immigrants is extreme hypocrisy.

And here I was ready to concede that ONLY conservatives think it's right to use racial profiling. Behold, our very own rdean seems to think that "local Hispanic leaders" equals "illegal aliens." Talk about racial profiling.

Mexican-Americans have threatened to boycott Taco Bells and flag poles unless the illegal immigrant kids are given breakfast burritos in the Every Kid Needs a Good Start Program. School adminstrators are up in arms over the problems caused by the farts in chemistry lab.
 
 
 
they may ban tequilla too.

How about ponchos and sombrerros?

- of good character and have no criminal records; and
- contributors to the general well-being of the nation.

The law also ensures that:
- immigration authorities have a record of each foreign visitor;
- foreign visitors do not violate their visa status;
- foreign visitors are banned from interfering in the country's internal politics;
- foreign visitors who enter under false pretenses are imprisoned or deported;
- foreign visitors violating the terms of their entry are imprisoned or deported;
- those who aid in illegal immigration will be sent to prison.

 Immigration Reform? Let's Try Mexico's Immigration Law! 

 

If you like Mexican laws, move there.
This is just like when someone posted the immigration laws in North Korea, and Iran. If they have such great laws, you guys should move there, and experience what their citizen go through. Personally I like freedom.
 
 
Why was my comment about greasy tacos censored??? Should I have used the work oily instead???
 
 
correction: 'word'
 
 
 
 
 
Who cares? My favorite day in the cafeteria here was enchiladas.

Tacos are actually an American invention, goober.

 

Againshelia must be your sockpuppet.  

 

Whose sockpuppet are you? Rdone/wrycatcher/chris/zona/pantyfold.... et al?

 

Damn! I've given out to much rep in 24 hours.  

Sorry Gunnyfuck....I'll hit ya up as soon as my ship (of Rep) comes in.  
 
 
 
 
I keep saying, why don't we just adopt Mexico's own immigration law?

At a time when the Supreme Court and many politicians seek to bring American law in line with foreign legal norms, it's noteworthy that nobody has argued that the U.S. look at how Mexico deals with immigration and what it might teach us about how best to solve our illegal immigration problem. Mexico has a single, streamlined law that ensures that foreign visitors and immigrants are:

- in the country legally;
- have the means to sustain themselves economically;
- not destined to be burdens on society;
- of economic and social benefit to society;
- of good character and have no criminal records; and
- contributors to the general well-being of the nation.

The law also ensures that:

Yep, I like freedom too. I like manifold's avatar, a pay check and pizza better and in that order.  
 
 
Mexican tacos aren't American tacos. Sort of like Chicago pizza is not New York pizza.

Transparent deflection. What's wrong with Mexico's version?
 
 
What's wrong with Mexico's version?

It is in Spanish/Espanol.
Not enough wiggle room on the illegal part.
Almost makes you think they don't want illegals.
...and the big one...THEY ENFORCE IT.

Yeh! Let's be like Mexico!      

 

You just suggested we adopt Mexico's laws....  

 

 The neo Nazi and Arizona law connection 

Maybe we already are
 
 
I'd MOVE to Arizona if they make it illegal to print the Spanish and French directions on things. Nothing like trying to read small directions on something when you're a bit older and having them make no sense. Then you realize it isn't English.

That is your answer for everything. When you have no arguement, you call someone a socialist. Last time I checked I wasn't a socialist.
And the founding father's sure set up some socialistic programs, like public education. And Thomas Jefferson doubled the federal government, and spent quite a bit of money on science. So in reality, we were here first.

My "answer for everything" is a mirror image of YOUR answer. If you don't like how it is HERE, leave. So leave.

The Founding Father's did NOT set up public education. Please quote me the Constitutional Right in the original Constitution that provides for and establishes public education.

Oh, you can't.

Then you can point out what that has to do with the OP.

Oh, you can't.

As usual, you can't hang.

Thomas Jefferson and some of the other people who wrote th constitution wrote Land Acts and Ordinances, establishing how towns would be set up, how the military would be paid, and how our education system would be paid for. Google it!

And as usual, your answer to everything is to tell someone to leave. Obviously you can't handle a different point of view.
Bring it!

  Gunny learned history in Texas where they are taught that Jefferson wasn't a Founder and tacos were invented in the United States.

  I am sure his answer will be Jefferson was for small government, and farmers.
Of course when Jefferson was President he increased the role of the federal government, but I bet they don't teach that in Texas.
I also love people who were in the military all their life call someone else a socialist.
