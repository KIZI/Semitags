Broadband providers have voiced alarm over an EU proposal to create a “Great Firewall of Europe” by blocking “illicit” web material at the borders of the bloc.

Anti-censorship campaigners compared the plan to China’s notorious system for controlling citizens’ access to blogs, news websites and social networking services.
The proposal emerged an obscure meeting of the Council of the European Union’s Law Enforcement Work Party (LEWP), a forum for cooperation on issues such as counter terrorism, customs and fraud.

“The Presidency of the LEWP presented its intention to propose concrete measures towards creating a single secure European cyberspace,” according to  brief minutes of the meeting .

The secure European cyberspace would have a "virtual Schengen border", it adds, referring to the treaty that allows freedom of movement within the EU but imposes controls on entry to the bloc.

There would also be “virtual access points" whereby “the Internet Service Providers would block illicit contents on the basis of the EU ‘black-list’”, the proposal says.

Oh great, now the EU get's to decide what sites we visit.
 
 
If it's anything to do with Schengen then it's not our problem.

I tire of the EU's insistence on regulating everything and piling on the red tape. The only thing there should be a European accord on is cybercrime, and we have that. The EU's interference here will just cost an exorbitant amount of money for virtually no gain, IMO.

It's not about Schengen it's about regulating internet content in the United Kingdom.

Absolutely right - the European Union really has been over stepping it's mark on so many issues.

It's not. It's describing it as a digital "Schengen agreement" - i.e. "freedom of movement" within the EU-ternet. It'll be a completely new treaty.

Did that law ever get through binding parliament to a referendum on any new treaty's from the EU?

It didn't bind parliament. If I recall correctly, it still gave the final decision to ministers meaning they will just say no.
 
 
Is there actually a problem with illicit sites within the EU or are they just doing something to earn their pay packet?

Well thats irritating. Though right now I doubt Cameron would. That might just push a large part of his party support in the public and party off a cliff

Agreed. As with all cybercrime, the game has completely changed - you cannot apply traditional policing techniques to curb it. But on the other hand, you can't easily implement technological solutions to the problem, either - simply because cyber criminals are too agile and fast moving for lumbering bureaucratic entities like the EU. You create an expensive technical solution to stop them and the cyber criminals will simply adapt, and the EU regulators won't be able to adapt again until the regulator's budget has been debated in a committee for months and then there will be failings in the implementation of the solution that will cost more money. It's pointless.

Individual nationstates are better off dealing with the problems they face from cybercrime unilaterally, rather than trying to come up with a grand unified solution for the entire EU.

I doubt Cameron would EVER give us a referendum on anything to do with the European Union - he claims to be Eurosceptic but he isn't, he is a Europhile in my view. Cameron is too weak.

+ rep

Absolutely - now I agree that EU states; or indeed any countries, should work together to tackle cyber crime - police in various states need to cooperate to taclke it, however, it should be done on the basis of individual nationstates not some supranational behemoth with all the bureaucracy of the European Commission and all the might of the Belgium.

Much of the really illegal content is filtered at source by the ISPs anyway, meaning that only underground crime rings can operate. But the technologies that these organisations use - such as VPNs - would get around any filtering that the EU could realistically implement. All blocking content does is drive it underground - it doesn't solve the problem.
 
 
As with all anti EU articles printed these days, i think there is more to this than first meets the eye. I've got a funny feeling that this isn't about censoring the eu but rather about actively protecting it. However i shall do some more research and report back  .

Thanks  

Cybercrime is like nothing we've seen before - it's organised crime on a totally distributed and global scale. Enforcement and co-operation should definitely be encouraged and, in my opinion, efforts to develop co-operative ties between the West and states like China and Russia etc. on cybercrime need to be stepped up.

I don't doubt him being weak. However Cameron is also a slippery bastard hard to pin down and he plays politics well. We may well see a referendum. There is a powerful lot of skeptics in the country as well as the party

Fair dos, the wording was confusing and I'm very tired  

However, in that case:

 

EU...

I don't buy it AJ...I don't think Cameron would ever give a referendum on the European Union. But we will see. Perhaps if he is backed into a corner he might.

Absolutely agree. Cybercrime is like nothing else - when you take down one site five more can pop up. Given the nature of technology, it is easy for criminals to infiltrate computers hundreds or even thousands of miles away. A small bit of code embedded on a website is enough to download to pretty vicious stuff onto someones computer.
 
 
 
EU...

I don't give a rat's arse whether it's going to be used for censorship or protection. It's an ineffective beige elephant that'll cost hundreds of millions/billions to implement and operate. It'll not realise its objectives, simply because a system so large cannot adapt to a small but focused change of strategy on the part of the cyber criminals.

I am more thinking a referendum on the individual treaty. That way he buys himself brownie points with his party and the electorate without actually doing anything really proactive on the EU.

Yes I know what you meant and I agree I just meant European Union as a generalised term for EU-related. I think a referendum on a Treaty would do brilliantly for the Conservative vote, especially in a few years time when people have felt the cuts - It might help to reduce some loses in seats/vote.
 
 
This smacks of police state and new world order. It must not be allowed to pass  

Allow them the power to restrict information for pseudo-legitimate reasons of protecting children and copyright, and these powers will be extended to limit access to criticism of the European Union, to control information on an unprecedented scale.

Freedom of speech and democracy are much more fragile than we are lead to believe.
 
 
The EU should make a firewall to block viruses and such forth but do not block the freedom of information here.
 
 
Never going to happen, next.

Again, a centralised system such as this is a really bad idea. It's far better to educate users not to succumb to the tricks malware writers use and decentralise anti-virus deployment to individual hosts.
 
 
Another idiotic thing that EU bureaucrats can add to their growing list.

Its hardly going to keep anything of extreme danger out anyway is it. Some European countries are home to many torrent site servers and those related to the sex industry. A lot of the information they want to censor will be based on European servers anyway so what is the point?

Then cyber criminals will just come up of more ways to exploit it meaning that they'll need to monitor it 24/7 and maintain it to extreme levels which in turn is going to cost a lot of money, our money. So we're in effect paying to be restricted to certain sites.

Plus there has also been reports that China's censorship has affected business with the outside world and made things a lot more awkward in some cases than they need to be.
 
 
Why does everyone here present EU proposals (they aren't even EU proposals - they are a suggestion by 1 person who is in the EU) as if they had been passed by the EU Parliament (or whatever body is responsible for it) and it's introduction is pending?

Be honest, is it really likely to happen, or is this just another attempt to stir up anti-EU feeling on the premise of EU meddling?

That's exactly what i was thinking, I just didn't have the balls to say it.  
 
 
The Bureaucracy system only exists to further its own existence. It hits the point where these massive bureaucratic institutions start passing laws and rules to make themselves needed, the EU is a perfect example of this
 
 
What do they mean by illicit sites?
 
 
 
What do they mean by illicit sites?

 

Fraudulent/scam sites, along with the obvious things like Child or other illegal forms of Pornography. Depending on how deep the EU is in the pockets of content providers like music, TV and film studios could also see filesharing sites get filtered, too.
 
 
These ***** should leave the internet alone and concentrate on things that matter.
 
 
It's exactly this sort of thing that makes me wonder how anyone can call themselves a 'conservative' while supporting the EU.

They push through a massive amount of legislation, have a parliament that is wasteful on a vast scale and constantly appear to want to drag all member states towards the social-democratic model favoured by most of the influencial countries in Europe.

When was the last time we saw them cut red tape or taxes? When has the EU ever shown any signs of being small government?

I just don't get how people like Ken Clarke - and on this forum Lib - can actually like it and still be right-wing.
 
 
If I know (and I do know).... The people Republic of China has a Great Firewall to protect they're people from bad things like Youtube, Facebook and dangerous like things containing danger words like a FREEDOM or REVOLUTION or anything from China's 'not so nice history'.

Education is a must but decentralising individual hosts is a near impossible task.

So rather than having millions of individual systems to overcome, the virus writers only have 1 system to overcome to hit 200 million hosts. All a centralised system will do is stop many ignorant people (the people that get hit the most by malware and scams) from taking their own precautions - they'll let their guard down, thinking they're protected by a super anti-malware shield. All you'd do is increase the problem.

It is not possible for a parliament to bind a future parliament unfortunately.

So I have seen. Still it would be nice if this Parliament was bound like that. No doubt a new treaty will come up in the next 3 or 4 years.
 
 
It is possible to bind a future parliament and I will give you a couple of examples - devolution and the European Union. Although theoretically we could end both tomorrow by passing an Act, in practice it isn't all that possible.

That is so far from the truth I just want to weep. Of course in practice it would be difficult to withdraw our membership from the EU and take back devolution powers from devolved assemblies. Please don't try to back your anti-EU-everything nonsense with half truths. The UK parliament has took back police powers in Northern Ireland when its assembly had 'issues'. Returning them when the problems resolved. Of course there would also be hurdles and difficulties in leaving the EU, but to argue its not possible is just unfounded.

Sorry but you are a fool - theoretically one parliament can bind another but practically they cannot. To turn back Scottish devolution is practically impossible. To withdraw from the European Union is practically impossible - I am not being Eurosceptic here, if I was I would be saying "oh withdrawal isn't that hard".

If this was about being anti-EU I wouldn't be making my argument more difficult by suggesting how difficult it is to withdraw from the EU.

You sir are a fool and should be treated as such.

Also for the record, learn to read, I didn't say it was impossible.

  So I may have misread your comments, no need to get rude. You are a wonderful person to exchange opinions with, lovely.
