"After the outbreak of World War II, Douglas enlisted in the wartime
Canadian Army. He had volunteered for overseas service and was on a
draft of men headed for the Winnipeg Grenadiers when a medical
examination turned up leg problems. Douglas stayed in Canada and the
Grenadiers headed for Hong Kong. But for that ailment, he would have
been with the regiment when its members were killed or captured at
Hong Kong in December 1941"

POD: Canadian military doctors never find Douglas' leg ailment and he
gets
shipped off to HK, getting killed like so many other Grenadiers.
Effects? Is the CCF able to take power in Saskatchewan in a TL without
Douglas? Are the CCF as strong throughout western Canada in TTL? Does
Canada get national health
insurance before the US in TTL?

All responses welcome, but especially I'd like to hear from Lyle
"Horny Goat" Craver on this one. Canadian politics in the mid 20th
century could be quite
different in a TL without Douglas.

Best,
Stan B.
