Hootie & The Blowfish is getting a monument in South Carolina's capital city.

The State newspaper reported that a large steel and black granite art piece will be unveiled Oct. 21 in Columbia's Five Points neighborhood, blocks from the University of South Carolina.

The newspaper reported the monument is expected to be about 20 feet (6 meters) long, 10 feet (3 meters) wide and at least 12 feet (3 1/2 meters) tall.

The Southern rockers sold more than 16 million copies of their debut album, "Cracked Rear View," released in 1994.

The band hasn't played together much recently. They celebrate their 25th anniversary next year.

Lead singer Darius Rucker has enjoyed a resurgence in country music, releasing his second solo country album next month, "Charleston SC 1966."
