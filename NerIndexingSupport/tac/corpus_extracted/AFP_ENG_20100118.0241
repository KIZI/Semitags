An Austrian man was found not guilty by a court here Monday of attempting to
kidnap the ex-head of the Kazakh secret service in the Austrian capital in 2008.

In a unanimous verdict, the accused, known only as Ildar A., was found not
guilty on all counts in the trial for the attempted abduction of exiled Kazakh
spy boss Alnur Musayev.

Prosecutors claimed 61-year-old Ildar A. attempted to abduct Musayev on behalf
of a foreign power.

He was also charged with bribing police officers to illegally obtain the
whereabouts of Rakhat Aliyev, the former son-in-law of Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev.

Like Musayev, Aliyev took refuge in Austria and the two men were close friends.

Musayev had been head of the Kazakh secret service (KNB) from 1997 to 2001,
while Aliyev, who had extensive dealings in the world of politics and business,
had been deputy foreign minister and then ambassador to Austria.

In March 2008, a Kazakh military tribunal sentenced both men in absentia for an
attempted coup.

But the 46-year-old former deputy foreign minister always maintained his
innocence and claimed he was the victim of a political witch-hunt designed to
crush his chances of running in the 2012 presidential elections.
