"The Report from last night`s match v Forest Green Rovers is NOT on the official Exeter City F.C. site !!!" How come Ant ? Still shell shocked like me, that we could let FGR come back twice ?  What worries me most is the apparent drop in attendances already, I know Liverpool were on TV last night BUT it wasn`t a frosty January night at SJP was it !  Any thoughts. Min - any printable thoughts ?

Kim,

With 5 minutes to go a superb header from Matt Taylor was going into the top
corner of the net when their goalie prevented a 4-2 score line as I had
predicted and 13 points in the prediction league.

5 minutes later and a 3-3 draw and I slip to 2 points.

A double whammy for me after that superb first 20minutes.

The Game, yet again we have no Midfield and some great subs by FGR while we
stand around enjoying a 2-0 lead instead of protecting it as could be seen
from the last 5 minutes of the 1st half when Awful missed that sitter.

Why take Artus off for Elam and too late. Take one of the 3 Forwards off
first and strengthen midfield maybe with Cozic. Stop the midfield sitting
back, why do we do it, If Gill is so good and Captain he should be pushing
up so we do not get stuck in our own penalty area. By the end of the game
Gill was completely swamped, has he got a problem/knock but has to play as
we have so many midfield injuries as he was a complete waste of time. I
think I would have left Artus on who was at least trying to feed the
forwards and not hit sideways balls or into touch!!

Quite honestly we are a mess when we allow the opposition to get back into
the game, when for the first 20 minutes we can be so good. Weird. Thankfully
no more games for a while Enjoy Ebbsfleet.

I didn't leave to the final whistle and was home in Bed in Leicester by
12.40. Motorway was empty.

Cheers

Min

Thanks for this Ant, was eagerly awaiting it and it didn't disappoint!

Sounds like it was a fabulous match to be at for the neutral as you say.

I will of course have to miss Saturday's game as still in Turkey but looking forward to Woking next Tuesday!
