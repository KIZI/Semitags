El Salvador's National Civilian Police (PNC) has arrested 24 members of street
gangs and charged them with 18 murders after a three-month investigation,
according to news reaching here on Wednesday.

Jose Roberto Carrillo Zelaya, 26,  who leads the Taynis Columbia Locos Surenos
street gang, was charged with ordering the murders, which all took place in
Apopa city in the state of San Salvador, the PNC said in a  statement on its
website on Wednesday.

Nine men and nine women were murdered in the 18 murders in the city. The
youngest of them was a 14-year-old boy murdered on March 1, and the oldest a 40
-year-old man killed on April 12.

The PNC said there were three main motives for the murders, which were conflicts
between rival gangs, punishment to gang members for theft or to people who owed
money to gang members.

Of the 24 gang members, 13 were men and 11 were women. The oldest of them is 35
and the youngest 18.

The PNC said that its homicide division has dismantled 18 street gangs so far
this year.
