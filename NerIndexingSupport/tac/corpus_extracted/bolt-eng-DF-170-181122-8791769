CNN) -- A small airplane crashed Thursday morning into a building in Austin, Texas, said Lynn Lundsford of the Federal Aviation Administration.

Firefighters used a ladder truck and other equipment to hose down the blaze at the building, which police said was located in the 9400 block of Research Boulevard.

Traffic on a nearby interstate started to snarl as black smoke poured out of the building.

Details were still forthcoming, authorities said.

Fox news is playing that news story right now on the tube.
 
 
So how many of you fucks are hoping its a terrorist attack?
 
 
Just a disgruntled CEO that got his bonus cut.
 
 
Due to budget cuts as a result of government cut-backs, there was no fuel to fly the plane.
 
 
How about we all get real excited and piss our pants beg for more government to protect us from any more threats....

or not.

Everyone needs to own an anti aircraft gun or two.
A.50 cal Browning works pretty well.
 
 
As I recall we had a small plane crash into a building in Tampa while I lived there. Looked strange that airpalne tail sticking out the side of the building.
 
 
so has the building collapsed straight down to the ground in seconds yet?

The Rothschild demo team has not arrived yet.
 
 
now the news is saying that the pilot torched his own house before he took off in the plane. The news is saying that this was intentional as well.

First reports are always sketchy, so take it with a big grain of salt at this point.
 
 
U.S. - you cheeky monkey!
 
 
The one in Tampa was intentional as well. A suicide attempt, but the guy failed and lived I think.
 
 
terral and clownlite will be posting the videos and first media reports soon, as soon as they are on youtube, as evidence of a conspiracy by boooooosh.

after all, it's in texas, so boooooosh must have something to do with it, with help from the joooooooos!

The news is reporting that the guy did it intentionally and have confirmed his ID, as well as that he torched his house because he was pissed off about taxes.
 
 
 
How about we all get real excited and piss our pants beg for more government to protect us from any more threats....

or not.

 

Yeah, thats the idiotic part. Asking for more laws to protect us from something that was illegal to start with.
Great point!
 
 
Id say there is some real righteous indignation out there in USA.

Time will tell who he is and why he did it. The first reports always have problems. I could see some hard-core libertarian doing this though, as well as a hard core republican(mcViegh) or even a hard core democrat.
The hard-core lunatics are all pretty much the same.

No, a tea partier hatin' on the IRS.
 
 
What was in the building?
 
 
We could play a guessing game where a right guess gets pos rep and a wrong one gets neg.

So far, I am not willing to make a guess as to his party affiliation, or even to trust the first media reports.
 
 
 
What was in the building?

 

the news says, federal offices, including the irs and fbi.

Then again, the first reports.............
 
 
Joeseph Andrew Stack is the name they have confirmed of the pilot.
 
 
So are the right wingers going to label this another terror attack on Obama's watch?
 
 
Hard to say what the partisan idiots will try to do citizen.
The news is saying now that there is an eyewitness that watched the plane bank and turn into the building. So it seems it was intentional.

I dunno. We'll wait for evidence.

You should give that some thought.

So should the President, before issuing a statement this time about how it was just an isolated nut job....
 
 
where is our fearful leader?????

Nah, Libertarian's have too much respect for property and money to torch the house and the plane....
 
 
From what I'm hearing the guys name was Joseph Stack and he wrote a "manifesto" on small government and taxes and all that good stuff before he flew the plane and he had a domestic dispute leading him to burn his house down before he took flight. Investigators have been on the news saying that it looks like from the video that the plane was flown into the building deliberately.

Doesn't look at all to be an accident, but certainly not an attack from Al Qaeda.

My prayers go out to the families of those affected.
 
 
so he was overtaxed. we might see a lot more Cessna's take the pluge !!!!

Well that's how this is going to be twisted I can already see it. Libertarianism is about to become the new "Islam" to the media for the next few months. Seems like this is just one crazy guy who lost alot and who was going to commit suicide anyway but decided to take down somebody with him. That is if all these theories on the news are correct.
 
 
I guess if you have to fly a plane into a government building, the IRS would be the best choice.
 
 
 
So how many of you fucks are hoping its a terrorist attack?

 

huh...apparently it was a suicide bomber.

Does that make him a terrorist?

 
 
 
Here's the dudes manifesto written today:
 Well Mr. Big Brother IRS man... take my pound of flesh and sleep well.

Yeah, I guess. Or you could classify it as "suicide with a twist" since nobody else has been confirmed dead yet from what I've seen.
 
 
 Small Plane Crashes in Echelon I Building in Austin, Texas, Joseph Andrew Stack May Have Been Pilot 

 
There are four separate fires burning in the seven-story building, located in the 9400 block of Research Boulevard. The entire building from the second to fourth floor is on fire. The Internal Revenue Service, the CIA and the FBI all have offices in that office park, though the FBI building was not hit. Two people from the building are reportedly and they are trying to determine where they are. According to the Statesman, a FBI agent said the plane was out of Waco and that the Federal Aviation Administration officials were en route to the scene.

 

 
Joseph Andrew Stack, a software engineer, is being named as a possible pilot of the plane. His wife, Sharon Stack and daughter were rescued by neighbors from their burning house at 1817 Dapplegrey in Austin. Stack reportedly lives in Austin and is a registered pilot of a Piper PA 28-236. The news reports are saying that he set the fire at his home and fled the scene before police arrived after being called for a domestic disturbance situation.

 

This is what I found looking up Joseph Andrew Stack,

 Well Mr. Big Brother IRS man... take my pound of flesh and sleep well. 

 
If youre reading this, youre no doubt asking yourself, Why did this have to happen? The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time. The writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isnt enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken. Needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if I would let it. I find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head. Exactly what is therapeutic about that Im not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

We are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy. Sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all. We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers. Remember? One of these was no taxation without representation. I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood. These days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a crackpot, traitor and worse.

While very few working people would say they havent had their fair share of taxes (as can I), in my lifetime I can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind. Nor, for that matter, are they the least bit interested in me or anything I have to say.

Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the GM executives, for scores of years) and when its time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours? Yet at the same time, the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this countrys leaders dont see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies. Yet, the political representatives (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the terrible health care problem. Its clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people dont get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in.

And justice? Youve got to be kidding!

How can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and, indeed, our entire legal system? Here we have a system that is, by far, too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand. Yet, it mercilessly holds accountable its victims, claiming that theyre responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand. The law requires a signature on the bottom of a tax filing; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing; if thats not duress than what is. If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is.

How did I get here?

My introduction to the real American nightmare starts back in the early 80s. Unfortunately after more than 16 years of school, somewhere along the line I picked up the absurd, pompous notion that I could read and understand plain English. Some friends introduced me to a group of people who were having tax code readings and discussions. In particular, zeroed in on a section relating to the wonderful exemptions that make institutions like the vulgar, corrupt Catholic Church so incredibly wealthy. We carefully studied the law (with the help of some of the best, high-paid, experienced tax lawyers in the business), and then began to do exactly what the big boys were doing (except that we werent steeling from our congregation or lying to the government about our massive profits in the name of God). We took a great deal of care to make it all visible, following all of the rules, exactly the way the law said it was to be done.

The intent of this exercise and our efforts was to bring about a much-needed re-evaluation of the laws that allow the monsters of organized religion to make such a mockery of people who earn an honest living. However, this is where I learned that there are two interpretations for every law; one for the very rich, and one for the rest of us Oh, and the monsters are the very ones making and enforcing the laws; the inquisition is still alive and well today in this country.

That little lesson in patriotism cost me $40,000+, 10 years of my life, and set my retirement plans back to 0. It made me realize for the first time that I live in a country with an ideology that is based on a total and complete lie. It also made me realize, not only how naive I had been, but also the incredible stupidity of the American public; that they buy, hook, line, and sinker, the crap about their freedom and that they continue to do so with eyes closed in the face of overwhelming evidence and all that keeps happening in front of them.

Before even having to make a shaky recovery from the sting of the first lesson on what justice really means in this country (around 1984 after making my way through engineering school and still another five years of paying my dues), I felt I finally had to take a chance of launching my dream of becoming an independent engineer.

On the subjects of engineers and dreams of independence, I should digress somewhat to say that Im sure that I inherited the fascination for creative problem solving from my father. I realized this at a very young age.

The significance of independence, however, came much later during my early years of college; at the age of 18 or 19 when I was living on my own as student in an apartment in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. My neighbor was an elderly retired woman (80+ seemed ancient to me at that age) who was the widowed wife of a retired steel worker. Her husband had worked all his life in the steel mills of central Pennsylvania with promises from big business and the union that, for his 30 years of service, he would have a pension and medical care to look forward to in his retirement. Instead he was one of the thousands who got nothing because the incompetent mill management and corrupt union (not to mention the government) raided their pension funds and stole their retirement. All she had was social security to live on.

In retrospect, the situation was laughable because here I was living on peanut butter and bread (or Ritz crackers when I could afford to splurge) for months at a time. When I got to know this poor figure and heard her story I felt worse for her plight than for my own (I, after all, I thought I had everything to in front of me). I was genuinely appalled at one point, as we exchanged stories and commiserated with each other over our situations, when she in her grandmotherly fashion tried to convince me that I would be healthier eating cat food (like her) rather than trying to get all my substance from peanut butter and bread. I couldnt quite go there, but the impression was made. I decided that I didnt trust big business to take care of me, and that I would take responsibility for my own future and myself.

Return to the early 80s, and here I was off to a terrifying start as a wet-behind-the-ears contract software engineer... and two years later, thanks to the fine backroom, midnight effort by the sleazy executives of Arthur Andersen (the very same folks who later brought us Enron and other such calamities) and an equally sleazy New York Senator (Patrick Moynihan), we saw the passage of 1986 tax reform act with its section 1706.

For you who are unfamiliar, here is the core text of the IRS Section 1706, defining the treatment of workers (such as contract engineers) for tax purposes. Visit this link for a conference committee report (  Synergistech :: Section 1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act  ) regarding the intended interpretation of Section 1706 and the relevant parts of Section 530, as amended. For information on how these laws affect technical services workers and their clients, read our discussion here (  Synergistech :: Laws affecting brokered Independent Contractors' tax status  ).

SEC. 1706. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TECHNICAL PERSONNEL.

(a) IN GENERAL - Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:

(d) EXCEPTION. - This section shall not apply in the case of an individual who pursuant to an arrangement between the taxpayer and another person, provides services for such other person as an engineer, designer, drafter, computer programmer, systems analyst, or other similarly skilled worker engaged in a similar line of work.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. - The amendment made by this section shall apply to remuneration paid and services rendered after December 31, 1986.

Note:

· "another person" is the client in the traditional job-shop relationship.

· "taxpayer" is the recruiter, broker, agency, or job shop.

· "individual", "employee", or "worker" is you.

Admittedly, you need to read the treatment to understand what it is saying but its not very complicated. The bottom line is that they may as well have put my name right in the text of section (d). Moreover, they could only have been more blunt if they would have came out and directly declared me a criminal and non-citizen slave. Twenty years later, I still cant believe my eyes.

During 1987, I spent close to $5000 of my pocket change, and at least 1000 hours of my time writing, printing, and mailing to any senator, congressman, governor, or slug that might listen; none did, and they universally treated me as if I was wasting their time. I spent countless hours on the L.A. freeways driving to meetings and any and all of the disorganized professional groups who were attempting to mount a campaign against this atrocity. This, only to discover that our efforts were being easily derailed by a few moles from the brokers who were just beginning to enjoy the windfall from the new declaration of their freedom. Oh, and dont forget, for all of the time I was spending on this, I was loosing income that I couldnt bill clients.

After months of struggling it had clearly gotten to be a futile exercise. The best we could get for all of our trouble is a pronouncement from an IRS mouthpiece that they werent going to enforce that provision (read harass engineers and scientists). This immediately proved to be a lie, and the mere existence of the regulation began to have its impact on my bottom line; this, of course, was the intended effect.

Again, rewind my retirement plans back to 0 and shift them into idle. If I had any sense, I clearly should have left abandoned engineering and never looked back.

Instead I got busy working 100-hour workweeks. Then came the L.A. depression of the early 1990s. Our leaders decided that they didnt need the all of those extra Air Force bases they had in Southern California, so they were closed; just like that. The result was economic devastation in the region that rivaled the widely publicized Texas S&L fiasco. However, because the government caused it, no one gave a shit about all of the young families who lost their homes or street after street of boarded up houses abandoned to the wealthy loan companies who received government funds to shore up their windfall. Again, I lost my retirement.

Years later, after weathering a divorce and the constant struggle trying to build some momentum with my business, I find myself once again beginning to finally pick up some speed. Then came the.COM bust and the 911 nightmare. Our leaders decided that all aircraft were grounded for what seemed like an eternity; and long after that, special facilities like San Francisco were on security alert for months. This made access to my customers prohibitively expensive. Ironically, after what they had done the Government came to the aid of the airlines with billions of our tax dollars  as usual they left me to rot and die while they bailed out their rich, incompetent cronies WITH MY MONEY! After these events, there went my business but not quite yet all of my retirement and savings.

By this time, Im thinking that it might be good for a change. Bye to California, Ill try Austin for a while. So I moved, only to find out that this is a place with a highly inflated sense of self-importance and where damn little real engineering work is done. Ive never experienced such a hard time finding work. The rates are 1/3 of what I was earning before the crash, because pay rates here are fixed by the three or four large companies in the area who are in collusion to drive down prices and wages and this happens because the justice department is all on the take and doesnt give a fuck about serving anyone or anything but themselves and their rich buddies.

To survive, I was forced to cannibalize my savings and retirement, the last of which was a small IRA. This came in a year with mammoth expenses and not a single dollar of income. I filed no return that year thinking that because I didnt have any income there was no need. The sleazy government decided that they disagreed. But they didnt notify me in time for me to launch a legal objection so when I attempted to get a protest filed with the court I was told I was no longer entitled to due process because the time to file ran out. Bend over for another $10,000 helping of justice.

So now we come to the present. After my experience with the CPA world, following the business crash I swore that Id never enter another accountants office again. But here I am with a new marriage and a boatload of undocumented income, not to mention an expensive new business asset, a piano, which I had no idea how to handle. After considerable thought I decided that it would be irresponsible NOT to get professional help; a very big mistake.

When we received the forms back I was very optimistic that they were in order. I had taken all of the years information to Bill Ross, and he came back with results very similar to what I was expecting. Except that he had neglected to include the contents of Sheryls unreported income; $12,700 worth of it. To make matters worse, Ross knew all along this was missing and I didnt have a clue until he pointed it out in the middle of the audit. By that time it had become brutally evident that he was representing himself and not me.

This left me stuck in the middle of this disaster trying to defend transactions that have no relationship to anything tax-related (at least the tax-related transactions were poorly documented). Things I never knew anything about and things my wife had no clue would ever matter to anyone. The end result is well, just look around.

I remember reading about the stock market crash before the great depression and how there were wealthy bankers and businessmen jumping out of windows when they realized they screwed up and lost everything. Isnt it ironic how far weve come in 60 years in this country that they now know how to fix that little economic problem; they just steal from the middle class (who doesnt have any say in it, elections are a joke) to cover their asses and its business-as-usual. Now when the wealthy fuck up, the poor get to die for the mistakes isnt that a clever, tidy solution.

As government agencies go, the FAA is often justifiably referred to as a tombstone agency, though they are hardly alone. The recent presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government. Nothing changes unless there is a body count (unless it is in the interest of the wealthy sows at the government trough). In a government full of hypocrites from top to bottom, life is as cheap as their lies and their self-serving laws.

I know Im hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand. It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country, and it isnt limited to the blacks, and poor immigrants. I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after. But I also know that by not adding my body to the count, I insure nothing will change. I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at big brother while he strips my carcass, I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me, I choose not to pretend that business as usual wont continue; I have just had enough.

I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are. Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasnt so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.

I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, lets try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well.

so has the building collapsed straight down to the ground in seconds yet?

 

I dont know, has it been hit by a 747 moving at 600 miles per hour yet?
 
 
 
Here's the dudes manifesto written today:
 Well Mr. Big Brother IRS man... take my pound of flesh and sleep well. 

 

He sounds like an equal opportunity hater.

Hopefully no one else was harmed.

Sooo... he's a communist and he's attacking the IRS?    

   
 
 
 
 
so has the building collapsed straight down to the ground in seconds yet?

 

I dont know, has it been hit by a 747 moving at 600 miles per hour yet?

 

wtc 7 was not hit by an aircraft and structural damage was not a significant factor according to NIST the building would have collapsed regardless from fires alone...you should know these facts by now goatboy
 
 
 
So how many of you fucks are hoping its a terrorist attack?

 

Seems like it was.

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- A small airplane crashed into an office building in Austin, Texas which reportedly housed an Internal Revenue Service office, according to media reports Thursday. However, Austin officials said the crash is not terror related. So far, two people have been sent to the hospital and one person is unaccounted for, the authorities said. They declined to comment on the pilot. But the Wall Street Journal reported that a Texan named Joseph Stack made an Internet posting that indicated that he was responsible for the crash.

No, an irresponsible nutjob who obviously didn't have the ability to manage his own life, and tried to place blame on ANYBODY but himself.

He's railing against Bush and the government, so I guess we could make the irresponsible claim he's an Obamabot, eh?

Christ, liberals are fucking idiots!  
 
 
The guy owned his own airplane. How bad off could he have been?
 
 
 
 
How about we all get real excited and piss our pants beg for more government to protect us from any more threats....

or not.

 

Everyone needs to own an anti aircraft gun or two.
A.50 cal Browning works pretty well.

 

I'm holding out for an 88.
 
 
 
The guy owned his own airplane. How bad off could he have been?

 

Maybe he should have thought about paying his taxes instead of buying said airplane!

The dudes obviously a friggin' moonbat!  
 
 
 
 
 
does that mean we have two players willing to guess and play the rep game?

 

Heard the "manifesto".

Teabagger.

You started out good but you ended badly.

The guy hated everyone, apparently. Sometimes people are just batshit crazy.
 
 
Found the manifesto... tea bag terrorist through and through (sorry about posting the whole thing, but i think they're going to take it down soon).

 
If you’re reading this, you’re no doubt asking yourself, “Why did this have to happen?” The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time. The writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isn’t enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken. Needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if I would let it. I find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless… especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head. Exactly what is therapeutic about that I’m not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

We are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy. Sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all. We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers. Remember? One of these was “no taxation without representation”. I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood. These days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a “crackpot”, traitor and worse.

While very few working people would say they haven’t had their fair share of taxes (as can I), in my lifetime I can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind. Nor, for that matter, are they the least bit interested in me or anything I have to say.

Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the GM executives, for scores of years) and when it’s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours? Yet at the same time, the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this country’s leaders don’t see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies. Yet, the political “representatives” (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the “terrible health care problem”. It’s clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people don’t get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in.

And justice? You’ve got to be kidding!

How can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and, indeed, our entire legal system? Here we have a system that is, by far, too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand. Yet, it mercilessly “holds accountable” its victims, claiming that they’re responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand. The law “requires” a signature on the bottom of a tax filing; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing; if that’s not “duress” than what is. If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is.

How did I get here?

My introduction to the real American nightmare starts back in the early ‘80s. Unfortunately after more than 16 years of school, somewhere along the line I picked up the absurd, pompous notion that I could read and understand plain English. Some friends introduced me to a group of people who were having ‘tax code’ readings and discussions. In particular, zeroed in on a section relating to the wonderful “exemptions” that make institutions like the vulgar, corrupt Catholic Church so incredibly wealthy. We carefully studied the law (with the help of some of the “best”, high-paid, experienced tax lawyers in the business), and then began to do exactly what the “big boys” were doing (except that we weren’t steeling from our congregation or lying to the government about our massive profits in the name of God). We took a great deal of care to make it all visible, following all of the rules, exactly the way the law said it was to be done.

The intent of this exercise and our efforts was to bring about a much-needed re-evaluation of the laws that allow the monsters of organized religion to make such a mockery of people who earn an honest living. However, this is where I learned that there are two “interpretations” for every law; one for the very rich, and one for the rest of us… Oh, and the monsters are the very ones making and enforcing the laws; the inquisition is still alive and well today in this country.

That little lesson in patriotism cost me $40,000+, 10 years of my life, and set my retirement plans back to 0. It made me realize for the first time that I live in a country with an ideology that is based on a total and complete lie. It also made me realize, not only how naive I had been, but also the incredible stupidity of the American public; that they buy, hook, line, and sinker, the crap about their “freedom”… and that they continue to do so with eyes closed in the face of overwhelming evidence and all that keeps happening in front of them.

Before even having to make a shaky recovery from the sting of the first lesson on what justice really means in this country (around 1984 after making my way through engineering school and still another five years of “paying my dues”), I felt I finally had to take a chance of launching my dream of becoming an independent engineer.

On the subjects of engineers and dreams of independence, I should digress somewhat to say that I’m sure that I inherited the fascination for creative problem solving from my father. I realized this at a very young age.

The significance of independence, however, came much later during my early years of college; at the age of 18 or 19 when I was living on my own as student in an apartment in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. My neighbor was an elderly retired woman (80+ seemed ancient to me at that age) who was the widowed wife of a retired steel worker. Her husband had worked all his life in the steel mills of central Pennsylvania with promises from big business and the union that, for his 30 years of service, he would have a pension and medical care to look forward to in his retirement. Instead he was one of the thousands who got nothing because the incompetent mill management and corrupt union (not to mention the government) raided their pension funds and stole their retirement. All she had was social security to live on.

In retrospect, the situation was laughable because here I was living on peanut butter and bread (or Ritz crackers when I could afford to splurge) for months at a time. When I got to know this poor figure and heard her story I felt worse for her plight than for my own (I, after all, I thought I had everything to in front of me). I was genuinely appalled at one point, as we exchanged stories and commiserated with each other over our situations, when she in her grandmotherly fashion tried to convince me that I would be “healthier” eating cat food (like her) rather than trying to get all my substance from peanut butter and bread. I couldn’t quite go there, but the impression was made. I decided that I didn’t trust big business to take care of me, and that I would take responsibility for my own future and myself.

Return to the early ‘80s, and here I was off to a terrifying start as a ‘wet-behind-the-ears’ contract software engineer... and two years later, thanks to the fine backroom, midnight effort by the sleazy executives of Arthur Andersen (the very same folks who later brought us Enron and other such calamities) and an equally sleazy New York Senator (Patrick Moynihan), we saw the passage of 1986 tax reform act with its section 1706.

For you who are unfamiliar, here is the core text of the IRS Section 1706, defining the treatment of workers (such as contract engineers) for tax purposes. Visit this link for a conference committee report (  Synergistech :: Section 1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act  ) regarding the intended interpretation of Section 1706 and the relevant parts of Section 530, as amended. For information on how these laws affect technical services workers and their clients, read our discussion here (  Synergistech :: Laws affecting brokered Independent Contractors' tax status  ).

SEC. 1706. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TECHNICAL PERSONNEL.

(a) IN GENERAL - Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:

(d) EXCEPTION. - This section shall not apply in the case of an individual who pursuant to an arrangement between the taxpayer and another person, provides services for such other person as an engineer, designer, drafter, computer programmer, systems analyst, or other similarly skilled worker engaged in a similar line of work.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. - The amendment made by this section shall apply to remuneration paid and services rendered after December 31, 1986.

Note:

· "another person" is the client in the traditional job-shop relationship.

· "taxpayer" is the recruiter, broker, agency, or job shop.

· "individual", "employee", or "worker" is you.

Admittedly, you need to read the treatment to understand what it is saying but it’s not very complicated. The bottom line is that they may as well have put my name right in the text of section (d). Moreover, they could only have been more blunt if they would have came out and directly declared me a criminal and non-citizen slave. Twenty years later, I still can’t believe my eyes.

During 1987, I spent close to $5000 of my ‘pocket change’, and at least 1000 hours of my time writing, printing, and mailing to any senator, congressman, governor, or slug that might listen; none did, and they universally treated me as if I was wasting their time. I spent countless hours on the L.A. freeways driving to meetings and any and all of the disorganized professional groups who were attempting to mount a campaign against this atrocity. This, only to discover that our efforts were being easily derailed by a few moles from the brokers who were just beginning to enjoy the windfall from the new declaration of their “freedom”. Oh, and don’t forget, for all of the time I was spending on this, I was loosing income that I couldn’t bill clients.

After months of struggling it had clearly gotten to be a futile exercise. The best we could get for all of our trouble is a pronouncement from an IRS mouthpiece that they weren’t going to enforce that provision (read harass engineers and scientists). This immediately proved to be a lie, and the mere existence of the regulation began to have its impact on my bottom line; this, of course, was the intended effect.

Again, rewind my retirement plans back to 0 and shift them into idle. If I had any sense, I clearly should have left abandoned engineering and never looked back.

Instead I got busy working 100-hour workweeks. Then came the L.A. depression of the early 1990s. Our leaders decided that they didn’t need the all of those extra Air Force bases they had in Southern California, so they were closed; just like that. The result was economic devastation in the region that rivaled the widely publicized Texas S&L fiasco. However, because the government caused it, no one gave a shit about all of the young families who lost their homes or street after street of boarded up houses abandoned to the wealthy loan companies who received government funds to “shore up” their windfall. Again, I lost my retirement.

Years later, after weathering a divorce and the constant struggle trying to build some momentum with my business, I find myself once again beginning to finally pick up some speed. Then came the.COM bust and the 911 nightmare. Our leaders decided that all aircraft were grounded for what seemed like an eternity; and long after that, ‘special’ facilities like San Francisco were on security alert for months. This made access to my customers prohibitively expensive. Ironically, after what they had done the Government came to the aid of the airlines with billions of our tax dollars … as usual they left me to rot and die while they bailed out their rich, incompetent cronies WITH MY MONEY! After these events, there went my business but not quite yet all of my retirement and savings.

By this time, I’m thinking that it might be good for a change. Bye to California, I’ll try Austin for a while. So I moved, only to find out that this is a place with a highly inflated sense of self-importance and where damn little real engineering work is done. I’ve never experienced such a hard time finding work. The rates are 1/3 of what I was earning before the crash, because pay rates here are fixed by the three or four large companies in the area who are in collusion to drive down prices and wages… and this happens because the justice department is all on the take and doesn’t give a fuck about serving anyone or anything but themselves and their rich buddies.

To survive, I was forced to cannibalize my savings and retirement, the last of which was a small IRA. This came in a year with mammoth expenses and not a single dollar of income. I filed no return that year thinking that because I didn’t have any income there was no need. The sleazy government decided that they disagreed. But they didn’t notify me in time for me to launch a legal objection so when I attempted to get a protest filed with the court I was told I was no longer entitled to due process because the time to file ran out. Bend over for another $10,000 helping of justice.

So now we come to the present. After my experience with the CPA world, following the business crash I swore that I’d never enter another accountant’s office again. But here I am with a new marriage and a boatload of undocumented income, not to mention an expensive new business asset, a piano, which I had no idea how to handle. After considerable thought I decided that it would be irresponsible NOT to get professional help; a very big mistake.

When we received the forms back I was very optimistic that they were in order. I had taken all of the years information to Bill Ross, and he came back with results very similar to what I was expecting. Except that he had neglected to include the contents of Sheryl’s unreported income; $12,700 worth of it. To make matters worse, Ross knew all along this was missing and I didn’t have a clue until he pointed it out in the middle of the audit. By that time it had become brutally evident that he was representing himself and not me.

This left me stuck in the middle of this disaster trying to defend transactions that have no relationship to anything tax-related (at least the tax-related transactions were poorly documented). Things I never knew anything about and things my wife had no clue would ever matter to anyone. The end result is… well, just look around.

I remember reading about the stock market crash before the “great” depression and how there were wealthy bankers and businessmen jumping out of windows when they realized they screwed up and lost everything. Isn’t it ironic how far we’ve come in 60 years in this country that they now know how to fix that little economic problem; they just steal from the middle class (who doesn’t have any say in it, elections are a joke) to cover their asses and it’s “business-as-usual”. Now when the wealthy fuck up, the poor get to die for the mistakes… isn’t that a clever, tidy solution.

As government agencies go, the FAA is often justifiably referred to as a tombstone agency, though they are hardly alone. The recent presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government. Nothing changes unless there is a body count (unless it is in the interest of the wealthy sows at the government trough). In a government full of hypocrites from top to bottom, life is as cheap as their lies and their self-serving laws.

I know I’m hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand. It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country, and it isn’t limited to the blacks, and poor immigrants. I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after. But I also know that by not adding my body to the count, I insure nothing will change. I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at “big brother” while he strips my carcass, I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me, I choose not to pretend that business as usual won’t continue; I have just had enough.

I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are. Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn’t so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.

I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let’s try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well.

 The Manifesto Of Austin Texas Crash Pilot Joseph Andrew Stack 
 
 
You know.....I'm starting to wonder if the whole world hasn't gone a little crazy.......

Yesterday, there was an airplane similar to the one today that crashed 1/2 mile from my house here in Amarillo. Seems the plane had some problems and crashed into a building just down the street next to the grocery store I shop at. It happened at around 9:30 am.

Then.........around eleven, someone crashed an airplane in California. The crash (which killed 3 passengers), not only took out a building, but it also took out the power AND the water system for the town.

Today? Some ass hat decided to crash his airplane into a building in downtown Austin, hoping to get at the IRS office. There are also reports that the aircraft made a bigger explosion than the normal 40 gallons (fuel capacity of the aircraft), and there are suspicions which are being confirmed that there was more than just fuel in there.

He also burned his house down prior to getting in the plane. His wife and child made it out of the house, just before it went up. That shows motive and intent, as well as his manifesto, and from what his manifesto says, I'm guessing he's a FAUX tea party whack job.

According to witnesses that saw it, he did a dive, barely cleared an apartment building, rose up, and then dove in fast and steep (according to one who is a pilot), and doing much faster than it's cruising speed of 115.

1 person is in the hospital with serious injuries, and one is in the hospital with minor injuries. One person is still unaccounted for.

What I'd like to know, is can they locate his computer and search the hard drive?
 
 
 
The guy owned his own airplane. How bad off could he have been?

 

depends on whether he owned it or the bank did.
 
 
According to preliminary reports, he does own a plane, but apparently, the one that he crashed was stolen.

They're trying to sort it out still.
 
 
OMG OMG OMG!!!

Look at the photos from above the crash site.... No plane debris!!!!! It was a missile... where are the debris!!!!!????????

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I bet you anything that all the Jews went home for the day!!!

I have a cousin that knows someones father-in-law that heard from a friend that they saw Bush leaving the site just before the plane hit.
 
 
 
What I'd like to know, is can they locate his computer and search the hard drive?

 

they've already done it. they know he amended his "manifesto" 27 times, up to and including this morning

It was a tea bagger doing his version of 9/11. He left a suicide note.

terral and clownlite will be posting the videos and first media reports soon, as soon as they are on youtube, as evidence of a conspiracy by boooooosh.

after all, it's in texas, so boooooosh must have something to do with it, with help from the joooooooos!

The news is reporting that the guy did it intentionally and have confirmed his ID, as well as that he torched his house because he was pissed off about taxes.

 

so far sounds like a Libertarian.

 

Teabagger.

 

Thank you Janeane Garofalo

such retards.  

now i wonder what he'd say if the person was wearing a hajib.
 
 
This guy was a moron

That way, we wouldn't have to spend the cash on ammo.

I don't know, but I've got to say...some of the people on this message board make me wonder. This is not the first poster that approved of or called for violence.

Which is why I started that thread once upon a time...what do you do with that suspicion? If someone reported this idiot Stack into the authorities chances are he'd be in prison.

Im saying that presuming that people are insane because they do things that would never cross our minds and that we are sane is not necessarily true. I see no reason to conclude he is insane. I see no reason to conclude that we are sane.
 
 
 
You know.....I'm starting to wonder if the whole world hasn't gone a little crazy.......

 

You've noticed too?

This weeks been kind of crazy with all the church burnings and the church shooting in California.

There's been alot of suicides on the local news this week too. Sign of the times, I guess. Might just be the recession.

poor widdle wacko...
 
 
 
 
The guy owned his own airplane. How bad off could he have been?

 

depends on whether he owned it or the bank did.

 

Regardless, if that's the case, he obviously had the means to secure a loan from a bank which means he wasn't bad off at all.

My mother once told me a sure way to determine whether or not your insane.

If your in a room full of people and you think your the only sane one, your probably insane.

if losing $40,000 set his retirement plans back to zero (which he said it did), then he wasn't well off.
 
 
yeah it depends on when the bank-loan was made.

No, there's always more suicides in the winter caused by the lack of light (or something like that).
 
 
And.......let's not forget that other little incident this morning in Salt Lake City Utah........

Seems that someone left a bomb threat in the galley of a commercial jet that had 130 people onboard.
 
 
Notice the divorce and his wife and child made it out of his house he burned down..

Okay, you think that someone that lights a house on fire that contains a twelve year old girl and a woman and then flies a plane into a government building might be sane and the rest of us might be insane.

 
 
 
You just know that all the hosts at MSDNC are salivating at the prospect of tying the guy who flew a plane into a Federal Building in Texas to Conservatives or the Tea Party Movement. (Just the way the left lied about... and have not retracted... the story of the census worker in Kentucky whom they alleged was murdered by anti-government conservatives.)

The Dumbasses at Kos are already calling this "teabagger terrorism." However, that contention is not supported by the Manifesto that Joseph Andrew Stack, the kamikaze pilot, left behind. If the manifesto is legit, than a few selected out-takes should dispel the notion that this guy was any kind of Tea Partier.

...the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple...
The recent presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government. Nothing changes unless there is a body count.
The communist creed: From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. The capitalist creed: From each according to his gullibility, to each according to his greed.

His manifesto is rambling and disjointed. Someone from the left could just as easily cherry-pick passages to claim he was no left-winger. (And they will) But any fair analysis would conclude Joseph Andrew Stack hated the government, the banks, big business, the Catholic church, life, and himself. He was an anarchist and a nutjob. Despite what Keith, Chrissy, Ed, and Kyle will claim tonight... he was not a conservative.

So far, it appears he only managed to kill himself. Prayers of gratitude should be said for the lives that were spared. You might also pray that his family will be comforted.
 
 
The wife and kid BARELY made it out. Luckily, there was a neighbor who saved them.

Man.......this has to suck for his old lady.
 
 
 
 
 
Then again, maybe they are the sane ones and we are the crazy people...

Quit trying to be all deep and philosophical. Sanity is defined by what the majority thinks is sane. You are welcome look like a fucking moron by trying to redefine the word in your own way, but i reserve the right to make fun of you when you do.

Just shut up retard.
 
 
(Just the way the left lied about... and have not retracted... the story of the census worker in Kentucky whom they alleged was murdered by anti-government conservatives.)

Umm I think I posted the rest of the story on that a while back.
 
 
I think this dude was more of a Timothy McVeigh than Abulla Mohammed.
 
 
 
Notice the divorce and his wife and child made it out of his house he burned down..

 

See, this is why you never hear anything like being perpetrated by a southerner. We would have just gotten drunk, scratched the dog's belly & written a wrenching country song that would go on to make millions off record sales.

Im saying that presuming that people are insane because they do things that would never cross our minds and that we are sane is not necessarily true. I see no reason to conclude he is insane. I see no reason to conclude that we are sane.

 

Okay, you think that someone that lights a house on fire that contains a twelve year old girl and a woman and then flies a plane into a government building might be sane and the rest of us might be insane.

 

 

I dont like excusing evil by calling it insane. I dont think this guy was insane. I think he was hopeless and decided that the only way he could do anything was to do all these things.

And I sure as heck have never concluded that you might be sane.  
 
 
 
 
Notice the divorce and his wife and child made it out of his house he burned down..

 

See, this is why you never hear anything like being perpetrated by a southerner. We would have just gotten drunk, scratched the dog's belly & written a wrenching country song that would go on to make millions off record sales.  

 

Naah the southerners just shoot em.
 
 
 
You just know that all the hosts at MSDNC are salivating at the prospect of tying the guy who flew a plane into a Federal Building in Texas to Conservatives or the Tea Party Movement. (Just the way the left lied about... and have not retracted... the story of the census worker in Kentucky whom they alleged was murdered by anti-government conservatives.)

The Dumbasses at Kos are already calling this "teabagger terrorism." However, that contention is not supported by the Manifesto that Joseph Andrew Stack, the kamikaze pilot, left behind. If the manifesto is legit, than a few selected out-takes should dispel the notion that this guy was any kind of Tea Partier.

...the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple...
The recent presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government. Nothing changes unless there is a body count.
The communist creed: From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. The capitalist creed: From each according to his gullibility, to each according to his greed.

His manifesto is rambling and disjointed. Someone from the left could just as easily cherry-pick passages to claim he was no left-winger. (And they will) But any fair analysis would conclude Joseph Andrew Stack hated the government, the banks, big business, the Catholic church, life, and himself. He was an anarchist and a nutjob. Despite what Keith, Chrissy, Ed, and Kyle will claim tonight... he was not a conservative.

So far, it appears he only managed to kill himself. Prayers of gratitude should be said for the lives that were spared. You might also pray that his family will be comforted.

 

You left out his upset at GM's bailout, among other things, but thank you for your dishonesty.
 
 
 
The wife and kid BARELY made it out. Luckily, there was a neighbor who saved them.

Man.......this has to suck for his old lady.

 

You know what ive been thinking about, if he burned his house down, crazy or not, the insurance company isnt going to cover the loss. So not only were they having financial troubles to begin with, he also made sure his wife and child were homeless before he took his own life. They are fucked. What a dick.

Quit trying to be all deep and philosophical. Sanity is defined by what the majority thinks is sane. You are welcome look like a fucking moron by trying to redefine the word in your own way, but i reserve the right to make fun of you when you do.

Just shut up retard.

 

Sanity is defined by the majority? Since when?

I see no reason to conclude you are more sane than this man simply because he tried to kill himself. The evidence just isnt there.

Calling evil people insane excuses nothing.

 

No. Im not excusing his actions. You are. Insanity is an excuse. An insane person has no power to choose what they do. They don't know right from wrong.

This man knew what he was doing. He explained his reasoning for it and planned it out. That's not insanity. He knew he was being controversial. He knew people other than himself could die. He was delibrate.

If insanity wasnt an excuse to remove culpability for evil acts, people wouldnt be able to use the "Not guilty by reasons of insanity" defense.

I know people dont like admitting it. But some people just do evil things. It's not insane. They willfully choose it. People arent all good or even generally good.
 
 
 
Really? I thought if you took your own life, the insurance companies wouldn't pay.

 

Some do.
There is always some kind of "waiting period" clause on suicides.
I believe my personal insurance it was a year.

he cited in an MS word doc he was fed up with osama and his bail outs. citing GM as having more benefits than most Americans, claiming they and Chryler should have been allowed to go under. if their as good as they say they'll float. if not to bad. and he cited the dogs at the IRS which drove him into bankruptcy.

Osama is evil. But recognizing that he is evil is not the same as agreeing that he is insane. Much of what he does or wants to do SEEMS crazy to us; but it doesn't seem crazy to him or the fuckers who hang on the shit he spouts. His evil action is planned and methodical. There is a version of logic running through his particular motivation. We may reject it (rightfully so) but that doesn't make his evil excusable as just the byproduct of insanity.

i can be correct. i can be incorrect. but i'm never stupid.  

but we can call him a wackjob for now.

Deal?

 
 
 
 
 
 
depends on whether he owned it or the bank did.

 

Regardless, if that's the case, he obviously had the means to secure a loan from a bank which means he wasn't bad off at all.

 

if losing $40,000 set his retirement plans back to zero (which he said it did), then he wasn't well off.

 

I doubt $40,000 stood between him and retirement.

CNN) -- A small airplane crashed Thursday morning into a building in Austin, Texas, said Lynn Lundsford of the Federal Aviation Administration.

Firefighters used a ladder truck and other equipment to hose down the blaze at the building, which police said was located in the 9400 block of Research Boulevard.

Traffic on a nearby interstate started to snarl as black smoke poured out of the building.

Details were still forthcoming, authorities said.

after all, it's in texas, so boooooosh must have something to do with it, with help from the joooooooos!

The news is reporting that the guy did it intentionally and have confirmed his ID, as well as that he torched his house because he was pissed off about taxes.

 

so far sounds like a Libertarian.

 

Time will tell who he is and why he did it. The first reports always have problems. I could see some hard-core libertarian doing this though, as well as a hard core republican(mcViegh) or even a hard core democrat.
The hard-core lunatics are all pretty much the same.

 

A muslim. Had to be.
 
 
 
 
So how many of you fucks are hoping its a terrorist attack?

 

huh...apparently it was a suicide bomber.

And blaming a political group for this, is very childish.
 
 
I thinkit very childish to assign a political group to this guy, at this point anyway. There is too much that is unknown.

I havn't seen too many people say this;

He was a bad guy, a very bad guy. He attacked his own country, he was unamerican.

Those that want to argue over whether he was a republican or a democrat or a tea bagger or a libertarian, well those people are childish fools and should be ashamed of themselves.

Making political capital out of some USA hating nutjob is almost as unamerican as flying a plane into a building to get back at the irs.

You all should be ashamed.
people that act like that are a very big reason that our country has the problems that it does.

>wagging index finger<
for shame for shame for shame
 
 
Internet note posted by man linked to plane crash
Thursday, February 18, 2010, 12:16 PM

Editor’s note: We found this note on a Web site being pointed at by social media users. A search showed the domain that the note was posted on is registered to Joe Stack of San Marcos. A man by the same name, who has addresses in both Austin and San Marcos has been linked to today’s airplane crash.
If you’re reading this, you’re no doubt asking yourself, “Why did this have to happen?” The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time. The writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isn’t enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken. Needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if I would let it. I find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless… especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head. Exactly what is therapeutic about that I’m not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

We are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy. Sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all. We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers. Remember? One of these was “no taxation without representation”.

I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood. These days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a “crackpot”, traitor and worse.
While very few working people would say they haven’t had their fair share of taxes (as can I), in my lifetime I can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind. Nor, for that matter, are they the least bit interested in me or anything I have to say.

Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the GM executives, for scores of years) and when it’s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours? Yet at the same time, the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this country’s leaders don’t see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies. Yet, the political “representatives” (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the “terrible health care problem”. It’s clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people don’t get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in.

And justice? You’ve got to be kidding!

How can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and, indeed, our entire legal system? Here we have a system that is, by far, too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand. Yet, it mercilessly “holds accountable” its victims, claiming that they’re responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand. The law “requires” a signature on the bottom of a tax filing; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing; if that’s not “duress” than what is. If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is.

How did I get here?

I know I’m hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand. It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country, and it isn’t limited to the blacks, and poor immigrants. I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after. But I also know that by not adding my body to the count, I insure nothing will change. I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at “big brother” while he strips my carcass, I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me, I choose not to pretend that business as usual won’t continue; I have just had enough.

I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are. Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn’t so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.

I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let’s try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well.

I do. A terrorist performs terrorism when they get mad at the US government and then fly a plane into a building holding American citizens. A terrorist sympathizer is someone who doesn't condemn the attack. Both are odious. Both are dirty. Doesn't matter if their name is John Smith or Mohamed.

Do you personally know anyone like that?

what part of that doesn't apply to this freak?

 

First of all.. what civilian population was attacked? If I'm not mistaken that building is filled with federal employees. But that simple statement tells me you don't even know what the definition is.

Secondly.. what political end would he think this attack would "achieve"??

 
The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a Government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.

 

how was he coercing or intimidating the United States government? It was a single act by a single individual.. with no signs of a collective effort by anyone else... with no signs of a secondary incident.

Go ahead and place this asshole on the same level as Bin Laden.. but I think the Bin Laden's have the ability to "terrorize" an entire world.. not this guy.. he'd be lucky is he "terrorized" many people outside the city of Austin.

and the famil of the murdered people might disagree with you.
 
 
The craziest part of his rantings is that he seemed to think his deplorable actions would cause others to join him.

clearly it was the work of one of those tax..teaparty..anti -Obama rightwingdomestofacsist..highlighting the need for us to surrender our liberties for security..and keep a closer eye on these non-party members and their terrorist Conservative front groups..we have to wake up and realize these are not criminals but acts of war and if we are to keep the people safe we can not be restrained in our investigations and prosecution with things like rights and trials...I mean do you really want the next rightwingdomestofacsist smoking gun to be in the form of a mushroom cloud ?

Can anyone here just imagine what would have happened, what would have been said if Mr. Fitnah had given such a eulogy to one or more of the 9/11 hijackers?
 
 
 
Just because I don't ride the short bus thinking everyone who commits a violent act are "terrorists" doesn't mean I have any respect or admiration for this guy's insane and terrible actions.

 

I also don't think that everyone who commits a violent act is a terrorist.

A terrorist is someone who commits a violent act in a manner that he wants to be noticed and because he has a message that he want to be made known. A terrorist can work alone or with others.

Examples would be this guy, McVeigh, Unabomber, Fort Hood, the other Army base murders, Washington snipers, Atlanta Olympic bomber, abortion clinic bombers, William Ayers, Columbine, VA Tech.

Murderers who are not terrorists would be serial killers like the guy in Cleveland. Other serial killers may induce terror in a city because everyone is fearful that they might be a victim, but with these guys, there isn't a message behind their killings, only the need for power and control.

Others that are not terrorists, but just murderers are the guy who killed Dr. Tiller (he had a message, but he was very pointed in his killing and did not appear to want to hurt anyone else) and the Alabama professor, who murdered for her own personal shortcomings, not for a higher cause.

Um.. He had ties (and a wife) in Yemen, taught Arabic to Afghan refugees and spent several months in a Yemeni prison. He had been investigated by the FBI. However since his targets were military... NOT civilian... (remember???) and since he acted alone and no terrorist organization claimed responsibility for the attack..... I guess you could call him a "terrorist" if it rings your bell..

Put either of these acts on the same level of 9/11. Or the London Subway bombings. Or the market bombings in Baghdad.. and Pakistan.. and Israel.. and Saudi Arabia... A few years ago, a kid in a local high school in Alabama was stabbed to death one day in between classes.. is his attacker a terrorist?

I'm sure they would be proud that there is someone putting them on the same level as Bin Laden. I'm sure they would be trilled that you think they are just as terrorizing as Mohamed Atta. I bet both of these guys will be partying together someday with KSM.

Choose your battles man.

I'm sure they would be proud that there is someone putting them on the same level as Bin Laden. I'm sure they would be trilled that you think they are just as terrorizing as Mohamed Atta. I bet both of these guys will be partying together someday with KSM.

Choose your battles man.

 

So, is being Muslim a requirement for being what you consider a "terrorist"?
 
 
 
 
 
It seems to me you're trying to find differences when there are none. By your definition, the guy who shot the soldiers at a Little Rock recruiting station wasn't a terrorist.

 

Um.. He had ties (and a wife) in Yemen, taught Arabic to Afghan refugees and spent several months in a Yemeni prison. He had been investigated by the FBI. However since his targets were military... NOT civilian... (remember???) and since he acted alone and no terrorist organization claimed responsibility for the attack..... I guess you could call him a "terrorist" if it rings your bell..

I am sure some of the OK city families would like an answer to that question.
 
 
 
 
 
Calm down, Rudy!

I think I must have touched a nerve.

Did you know this guy? Was he a friend? Family member?

If so, I am deeply sorry for your loss, and I wish you and your family the best.

 

Just because I don't ride the short bus thinking everyone who commits a violent act are "terrorists" doesn't mean I have any respect or admiration for this guy's insane and terrible actions.

 

Do you think that the Ft. Hood shooter was a "terrorist"?

 

I would never give that fuck that much credit. He was a disgruntled employee who got butt-hurt when people made fun of his man dress.
The United States Army.. Colonel Elspeth Ritchie to be specific.. is just as responsible for that day as Hassan is...

Just because he was Muslim and ran into the room yelling "Allah Akbar" while he was shooting doesn't mean he's a terrorist. How were any of us "coerced" or "intimidated" by his actions?

To be clear: My brother is stationed at Fort Hood and passed through that very building just a few days before. I look forward to the day Hasan faces a jury of his "peers."

If it were up to me I would give each survivor of the shooting and one family member of each of his victims an M16 with one round in the chamber. The firing squad is still legal in the military if I'm not mistaken.

OKC was a domestic terror attack.

If this guy had 5,000 pounds of TNT in the back of his plane and blew the whole thing to the ground killing everyone inside.. then I'd call him a terrorist... Muslim or not.

It must mean that the Nigerian on the plane in Detroit was not a terrorist attack, but rather just a set of burned balls.

Look folks, Robert Gibbs said the plane crash was not terrorism. Now if the spokesman for the Obama Administration says it's not terrorism, that's good enough for me. Now get in line and everybody march in lock-step with one another before you get sent to a reeducation camp.

But the attack was on "property" which fits the recognized definition of terrorism.

I don't think he was simply because he had no organizational affiliations. (besides the fact that he was 15 year old kid)

  It doesn't take much to prove that Obama and his Administration suck. That's a given. But if you had been paying attention, you would have noticed that I placed my post between several others where the subject was whether this was a terrorist attack or not. And the mere fact that the Obama Administration said that it wasn't terrorism plays into this 'politically correct' lunacy that's infected America for far too many years.

I know Im hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand. It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country, and it isnt limited to the blacks, and poor immigrants. I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after. But I also know that by not adding my body to the count, I insure nothing will change. I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at big brother while he strips my carcass, I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me, I choose not to pretend that business as usual wont continue; I have just had enough.

I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are. Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasnt so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.

I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, lets try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well.

Can't be.

He's not a Muslim of middle-eastern descent.

I don't believe you just wrote this.  

 

 

 

Liability wasn't referring to Obama, rather Osama.

 

Oh, my!  
 
 
 
 
 
You know.. if you ignorant fucks place the label of "terrorist" on every single wacko in this country you are taking away the significance of the label on the people who really deserve it.

Do you even know what the definition of "terrorism" is?

 

targeting of civilian populations in order to achieve a political end.

what part of that doesn't apply to this freak?

 

First of all.. what civilian population was attacked? If I'm not mistaken that building is filled with federal employees. But that simple statement tells me you don't even know what the definition is.

Secondly.. what political end would he think this attack would "achieve"??

 
The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a Government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.

 

how was he coercing or intimidating the United States government? It was a single act by a single individual.. with no signs of a collective effort by anyone else... with no signs of a secondary incident.

Go ahead and place this asshole on the same level as Bin Laden.. but I think the Bin Laden's have the ability to "terrorize" an entire world.. not this guy.. he'd be lucky is he "terrorized" many people outside the city of Austin.

 

IRS employees are civilians that happen to work for the government. Quit being an idiot.

Which means they are federal employees.

A civilian is the guy working on the 70th floor of the World Trade Center. We can play the semantics game all night long if you want... but nobody of any authority has claimed that this is a terrorist attack... so civilians or not it doesn't mean this guy is a terrorist.
 
 
Federal employees are civilians except those in the military.

Gibbs said it is possibly a domestic terrorist act. Not sure why he qualified it...it is a domestic terrorist act. The guy is a fucking suicide bomber.

Terror, terror, terror, Terror!

Attack, attack, attack, Attack!

It was a terror Stack attack!

Memo to next guy to try this:

Next time would someone use a bigger plane and if you don't mind...try not to forget loading it with explosives.

Thank you

I don't believe the guy tried to kill his family. I think he just burned down the house so the government couldn't take it. If there is a fund set up for his family I will contribute to it.

Rudy the Retard, lemmie 'splain something to you.........federal employees are civilians.

Wanna know how I know? Worked alongside them for 20 years while in the Navy. In '94, when they were waiting to pass the budget, the civilians were told to go home, as the government didn't have any money to pay them.

The military worked for 10 days without getting paid. We were paid back pay of course, but for 10 days, we worked for free.

You can't do that to civilians.

As far as this being a terrorist attack? Yes.......it was, as there was a political statement made, and, for around 6 hours, he had a following on Facebook and MySpace who were praising that act and telling others that they should do so as well. Both pages were removed by the respective websites. The act was done intentionally, as well as pretty well planned out. He had an accelerant in the gas by the way, because 40 gals. of av gas is pretty explosive, but this was even bigger than they thought it should have been.

Know what's really scary? You can buy av gas in almost every town, without showing a pilots license or anything. Mix it with LOX and you've got what powers the shuttle into space.

Then, there is the retaining wall. Since some of the earlier terrorist attacks (namely McVeigh), almost all federal buildings are built with a lot of reinforcement at the ground level. Wanna know why? Car bombs. That's why this dude used a plane.

He hit into the building at a pretty steep dive, doing much faster than the 115 cruising speed, and piled into it just above the retaining wall of the building. He had to plan that one.

And........because of his manifesto? That is what makes it a domestic terrorist attack.

By the way, when you stated you don't think you ride the short bus? You're right.......you don't think, that's why you're a mouth breathing window licker on the short bus.
 
 
 
This guy was protesting taxes...in other words, he is a tea bagger. I blame Beck and Hannity.   Keep fear mongering gentlemen, you are doing a great job.

 

Over 200 years ago the Founding Fathers created Article III Courts to PEACEFULLY settle issues.

Those courts are now under the control of the welfare/warfare state. Is there a non-violent remedy left?

.
 
 
 
so he was overtaxed. we might see a lot more Cessna's take the pluge !!!!

 

I'm just waiting for ONE more........YOURS!!
 
 
 
 
 
Except it he didn't have a bomb.

 

Sure he did, he was flying it. Are you going to now claim the 9/11 hijackers weren't suicide bombers?  

 

They were not suicide bombers. They were terrorists who used planes crashing into buildings to incite terror.

 

Thats why they had parachutes and helmets! I was wondering about that.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Which means they are federal employees.

A civilian is the guy working on the 70th floor of the World Trade Center. We can play the semantics game all night long if you want... but nobody of any authority has claimed that this is a terrorist attack... so civilians or not it doesn't mean this guy is a terrorist.

 

I'm sorry, but federal employees are civilians. The military are not civilians.

And this most certainly was a terrorist attack...despite the fact that it was not Muslims doing it.

I think that you and people like you are just pissed because now you can't go around and say that all terrorist attacks have been by Muslims. (of course, that was never true in the first place...but whatever)

 

Show me a source of anyone with any legitimacy who calls this a terrorist attack.

I think that you and people like you are just pissed off that they have point a finger at some psycho like this guy. "Terrorism" was one of the power words of the Bush administration.. I forgive you for continuing to ride that wave. Hopefully you will learn one day. I doubt it though.

 

What exactly is the definition of a domestic terrorist attack?

(This was a terrorist attack, we just don't have a country to attack in retaliation. I say we should attack Iraq again for THIS attack just like last time.)
 
 
 
I have some empathy for this guys hatred for the Government.
I know many here do, but think that expressing it is the same as supporting what he did, it isn't.

 

Chris Rock on OJ..

Yes there is...and 99.99999% of us use that non-violent remedy. Those who won't or can't are called criminals and domestic terrorists. Which are you?

not enough oil there. I say, lets attack Iraq again. Lets scare everyone and say there are WMD's and the possibility of mushroom clouds. They are dumb enough to believe it, so let go! Fox, here we come.

She wasnt a tea bagger. She wasn't a terrorist. She was a murderer. Different kind of nut.

so what is this terrorist was a tea bagger? Did you really just say that? ok...I say its Beck and Hannity's fault. The feed the fear.

Just saying........
 
 
 
no he wasn't...and even if he was, so what

i bet you were all over the professor who killed 3 people because she was so devoted to obama, yeah, i bet you touted that all over the internets

 

what did that professor have to do with Obama?

She apparently murdered three people because she was going to lose her tenure.

I can't BELIEVE people are DEFENDING this SICK FUCK!!!! Odd how MOST of the defenders of this "man" are people from the right........HMMMM STRANGE!
 
 
The dude was a fucking moonbat.

His manifesto could be interpreted in a number of ways.

It could be just as easily interpreted as being left wing or right.

The dude was nuts, he couldn't manage his life so, he blames others for his failings.

Get over it people, and shut the fuck up already!
 
 
  A Suicide Attack on the IRS 

by Butler Shaffer

The recent suicide attack made by a man who crashed his plane into a Texas building housing IRS offices raises questions that neither the mainstream media nor other establishment voices will dare to examine. Such a frontal assault on the state  like suicide bombers in the Middle East  must not be seen as an indictment of political systems. The media will go into its obligatory "damage control" mode and marginalize the man  Joe Stack  as a "kook," a "terrorist," or an "extremist," another threat whose example can be turned to the benefit of the state. His lengthy, but inelegant, written statement explaining his anger at the government was quickly labeled a "diatribe," a "rant," and a "rambling screed," to discourage others from reading his words and having their thinking infected thereby. Far safer to have this man thought of as "insane," for what rational person would want to give his writing serious attention?

This is an example of wingnuts.
 
 
Ok...Ok....this guy was a TeaBaggin terrorizin whatever..

My only real problem with this action was the choice of target. Joe had all the right questions in his last blog and testament but chose the IRS as his target. The IRS doesn't make the laws that they must enforce. George Bush put the squeeze on what is left of the middle class with his tax cuts for Paris Hilton. I think Stack should have chosen a target that would have been less obvious than the IRS. It was too easy to dissmiss him.

Now to some unanswererd questions.

Am I the only one that finds it incredible that there was the loss of one life aside from Stack?

This scenerio just fuckin screams they were warned.

How many injuries? This story sure went away at record speed. How many weeks of coverage about a lost blonde bimbo tramp in Aruba?

I bet if Fox's headquarters was attacked they wouldn't brush it off so fast...Or maybe the home offices of the health care provider Stack paid into for years..That would have been my choice...since health care is topical....and everything.
 
 
 
Am I the only one that finds it incredible that there was the loss of one life aside from Stack?

This scenerio just fuckin screams they were warned.

 

Stack was pretty deficient in his understanding of American culture.

Just like the 9-11 attacks made US support for Israel all the stronger and got the country behind a joke of a president so will his attacks on a smaller scale make the tea bag party or whatever they're called, look like fool radicals.
 
 
This morning, the dirtbag's cunt whore of a daughter was on GMA, and stated that her father was a hero for standing up to the government.

Personally? His daughter ought to be strung up and hung as a traitor.

We have culture? We are the son's, grandsons..and great grandsons...etc of thieves and liars. I get so sick of all the pompus hubris of "my fellow Americans"..especially all the phoney cowardly flag wrappers and waivers. REALITY CHECK We stole this country from its inhabitants...The native americans and the mexicans. Then we set out to exterminate them...in a fashioin that makes the holocaust pale in comparison. We had slavery for over a hundred years. We saved europe in wwII and defeated the Japs whom we forced to attack us. We are a nation of liars and hypocrites. We have broken almost every treaty we have entered into yet we scream to the heavens when our integrity is challenged. We are so blind and dishonest with what we have done and what we have become that to tell the truth...I don't believe we care about the truth. Stack wasn't much of a man or a hero but he was definitly not a lying coward. I wish I could say that about most americans. You know....its all about the culture.

That is a good point. More shame to those defending this asshole.

Sorry we can't agree on this one Rob. I wish there were a hundred more like him. The filthy and the rich have made our votes worthless and need to be first taught who they are fucking with then bombed into submitting to the will of the people and the letter of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

You know......we'd agree if the dude had gone in and shot the IRS agent. Then, no buildings get destroyed, and nobody dies except the person who is a direct representative of the government. I mean.......they brought guns to rallies that had nothing to do with guns, right?

I'm of the opinion that crashing an aircraft into a federal building, intentionally, to cause great unrest and to make a point, is terrorism. And, coming on the heels on 9/11 (at which time I was still active duty), I just think it's fucked up.

If you're really pissed at the government do something, but leave the buildings standing.

We're in a recession for fuck's sake. It's expensive to rebuild stuff.

Why? He had no right to kill anyone, let alone someone that was just performing their job.

 
 
 
Hey......if he'd just shot at the dude, maybe he'd still be alive and the building would still be standing.

But........in this case ANYTHING is better than crashing a plane into a building and giving everyone else flashbacks to 9/11.

Good people gettin squeezed outta thier houses... dyin for lack of health care and you worried about the budget?

There was a time when this country could have reached higher and become truly great but Carter screwed the pooch and allowed that snake Reagan in the door to start our country on this long downward spiral. If Carter had an ounce of balls he would have sent out hit squads to knock off the collaborators in the CIA and NSA and republican party that worked out a deal with Kehomenie to release the 50 Iranian hostages on the very fuckin day Reagan infected our country with his presidency. That was the beginning of the end and now that the fascists have thier tentacles firmly gripping all fascets of our "democracy". There is little left that anyone can do to effect recovery of this country back to the citizens. Blood must be spilt. Corporate blood. Judicial blood....and most definitly lobbiest blood. Traitors must pay for what they do. Call it terrorism..I really don't give a fuck. What name do you have even in your dreams for those that have taken so much of our treasury and the lives of our finest...or don't you dare dream about it? If you did you must take a side...your dream perspective.

We need a hundred Stacks to get thier attention. One guy won't cut it. The vermin will not give up unless they believe stealing from our country and commiting treason is not worth dying over. What is thought about cleaning up these scum by those too cowardly to live life more than a cow or a pig in the stockyard awaiting thier demise is irrellevant.

No doubt the feds are watching this website. I do not fear the "feds". What I fear is the complacency that has allowed the takeover of this country by those that would steal from our treasury and lie pussies like yourself into believing that we must kiss the boots of multinational and home based traitorous corporations that have destroyed the strength of our nation.

I don't live in a "basement" asshole. I don't care if twats like you find it uncomfortable that I point out who, in my view, the true enemies of our country really are. I am not on this MB to please cowards. As I stated from day one..I am here to expose the traitors in our midst knowing, unknowingly and/or willfully in support of the destruction of our way of life.

Morons like you are in full support of mass murder such as Iraq yet get squeemish at the thought of sacrifice to draw attention to mass murder of our own people here at home. 45,000 die every year for want of health care. You don't care?..then go fuck yourself. I will gladly see a thousand of these lobbiest pawns, corporate gouls and scum, that prevent our elected officials with bribes from doing thier elected duty, from drawing one more breath.

I don't give a rats ass what the "feds" think about my open support for patriots that give thier all in an effort to reclaim our country from fascism. Wrong asshole. Stack was a bit missguided in his targets. He blamed the IRS which was wrong. He attacked a building housing FBI and IRS...that was also wrong!..But he was a straight up hero in his motivation and his commitment.

He was a fucking moonbat who couldn't manage his life, and chose to blame HIS OWN FAILURES on anybody but himself. The man obviously couldn't handle his own personal responsibility in life, and he WANTONELY MURDERED an innocent who had nothing to do with his lack of responsibility in life.

Anyone defending that scumbag is a fucking coward!

Christ, I can't believe i'm actually agreeing with Ravi on anything!  
 
 
Armageddon is coming Jester........

First, you and I agreed on the Superbowl and the music.

Now? You're agreeing with Ravi.

Come over to the light......really......it's okay.......
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fuck you. I'll have a thousand Stacks over cowards and liars and traitors like yourself. I hope the next attack is at a Walmart and you are in there spending american currency on some chineez crap. Piss on you.

 

I hope the fed's are monitoring this website.

You're undoubtedly an unstable lil' bugger!

You and the grasshopper there just might be pulled out of your mommy's basements for a lil' trip downtown!

Loose lips sinks ships, dumbass!

 

No doubt the feds are watching this website. I do not fear the "feds". What I fear is the complacency that has allowed the takeover of this country by those that would steal from our treasury and lie pussies like yourself into believing that we must kiss the boots of multinational and home based traitorous corporations that have destroyed the strength of our nation.

I don't live in a "basement" asshole. I don't care if twats like you find it uncomfortable that I point out who, in my view, the true enemies of our country really are. I am not on this MB to please cowards. As I stated from day one..I am here to expose the traitors in our midst knowing, unknowingly and/or willfully in support of the destruction of our way of life.

Morons like you are in full support of mass murder such as Iraq yet get squeemish at the thought of sacrifice to draw attention to mass murder of our own people here at home. 45,000 die every year for want of health care. You don't care?..then go fuck yourself. I will gladly see a thousand of these lobbiest pawns, corporate gouls and scum, that prevent our elected officials with bribes from doing thier elected duty, from drawing one more breath.

I don't give a rats ass what the "feds" think about my open support for patriots that give thier all in an effort to reclaim our country from fascism. Wrong asshole. Stack was a bit missguided in his targets. He blamed the IRS which was wrong. He attacked a building housing FBI and IRS...that was also wrong!..But he was a straight up hero in his motivation and his commitment.

 

You better watch what the fuck flies outta ya mouth
Or I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat, so when you scream, only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be...a more wicked MC
'Cuz AIDs infested child molesters aren't sicker than me

 Immortal Technique - Cause of Death Lyrics

Hey i'm up for a lil' armageddon action.

No way in hell i'll jump to your side though. I've got to much pride to lower myself to that level BUT, I'll offer you up a compromise.

You throw some of them thar FAR lefty's my way, and I'll toss some of them thar FAR righty's your way. After we're done takin' care of much needed biznezz, maybe we can meet somewhere in the middle!

No he wasn't. He was a fucking tax cheat that killed an innocent bystander.

 

You think he burnt down his own house and sacrificed his life erroneously flying an airplane into that building because he was caught cheating on his taxes? How naive. How willfully ignorant. He made his delema clear in his internet suicide letter. You can take the easy way out in this arument and believe the corporate owned media if you want to but that is lazy. I doubt you read Stacks letter.

I refer back to the revolutionary war when the "safe" position taken by over 80% of the population of the colonies was in support of the Brittish. There is so much wrong now in our country. The situation is beyond the power of the ballot to fix. The ballot itself is under attack from the filth that owns the media and the congress and the very machines we vote on.

Right in the middle of the war against the strangle hold of HMO's on the life and health of all of our citizens the goulish health care providers have raised the premiums 40-60% and where is the protest? Do any of you people understand that the rise in cost of your health care is the money the providers have spent over the last year to kill the reform? You fuckin dummies are being charged for the propoganda and the bribes to our electred officials and nary a fuckin peep out of you cowards. Piss on you.

Ravi...I respect most of your positions but not this one. It is driven out of misplaced fear is a dissapointment indeed. A man like Stack was absolutely no threat to you. So who is it that you are protecting? I understand the horror. It is easy to focus on the act, the drama and the tv fire and the loss of the one life and overlook what happens every day off the tv screen as TENS OF THOUSANDS die needlessly all over our country without media commentary. We walk up the ramp to the slaughterhouse door to the man with the killing stick and when one of us raises a fuss he is called crazy. Then all of the cows moo in agreement and submission.

Granted Mr. Stack chose poorly his target. He made it easy to dissmiss his statement by attacking the IRS. That appeared to be a little too personal. If you fully read his blog it is clear he knew who the enemy really is. He only had one life and one plane. It is unfortunate that in his deminished state of mind he chose that building. I still submit that he called ahead to warn them...how else was it possible so few got killed(1) or injured(0)?Or does that not count for anything in his condemnation?

Oh, I read it. He claimed to be angry about a lot of things...but his main focus of anger was a decades old tax law that he claimed kept him from being successful. There is no tax law in this country that keeps ANYONE from being successful. And even if there was, that doesn't give him the right to kill an innocent bystander.

It doesn't matter that he didn't threaten me personally. He killed an innocent person for no good reason other than his own ineptness at making as much money as he thought he was worth...that makes him a coward and a terrorist.

And the freak owned a house and an airplane...he was more successful than most.

Quit being an idiot.

Now it is quite possible that he had some serious mental issues...but that also doesn't excuse him or validate his actions.
 
 
 
And even if there was, that doesn't give him the right to kill an innocent bystander..

 

an innocent bystander.............hummmmmmmmm

Didn't the innocent bystander somehow acquired the authority to seize and confiscate US taxpayers' property?

He shouldn't have done what he did. According to my Christian beliefs, suicide is sin and killing someone else (that wasn't in self-defense or protection of others) only adds to the sin list. Besides, now it makes the anti-big government people out to be terrorists, and the corporate establishment has one more thing on us now. SIGH.

However, I do agree that the concerns in his letter are valid.

Why do I have to quit being the idiot?   My position is based on a different foundation than many if not all of you goofs. I've been on and way over the line so many times I've lost count. I do not seek permission for my reasoning. I do not place much value in authority(big suprise   ). Well... sugar shorts, I am in good company because neither did our countries founding fathers.

If you had lived my life and seen what I have seen then you might not be so dismissive of my position. I'm not saying you would agree but when one sees a wide range of outcome as a result of violent action, one can appreciate the potential for good outcome better.

I have seen a steady insidious decline in the strength and character of our country over the last 50 years. The diseases that have afflicted us are greed, willfull ignorance and cowardice.

So many of us have been trained to believe the morons message on the TV. Back when I was a kid on the farm nobody wasted time like that. The values we learned were real...not sold to us..by Kellogs and Proctor and Gamble and Phillip Morris. When I first saw the Marlboro man I thought he was a faggot because everyone that rides a horse chasing cows out in open country knows that for one thing you get fuckin dirty..top to bottom and only a queer would pose for some faggy photo sparkling clean.

Bad example?...not really. Life isn't clean outside this fucking cacoon we have concocted for ourselves. We are talked into sending our kids to fight wars with only a scant resemblance to defending our countries legitimate security. This travisty is always at the beck and call of those that make the bullits and bombs. Our kids and many many more innocents abroad die just as dead as the one that died in that building. This outrage is astounding. 50,000 will die and ten times as many will be injured on our highways this year just as violently and surely just as dead. I don't see anybody screeching like school girls over THAT. So clearly it isn't the deaths that bother you...it is the message that somebody believes in all his heart that something is so wrong it is worth dying for and killing another to make his point. A spit in the ocean fatality wise. Very dramatic statement wise.

So you don't believe there is anything going on so bad in our country that it is worth dying or killing for? Then what are we doing with police and the "feds"? Well maybe you have not seen enough worth that kind of sacrifice. I have. Call me an idiot if you want. But you need idiots like me on this board or Mr Stack in that airplane wether you admit it or not. It is clear to me that no one else but those like us can rise to the challange of trying to fight back the willfull ignorance or like Mr. Stack, offer more than just lip service in homage to our enemies.
 
 
I don't think not wanting to pay your taxes is a valid reason to kill an innocent bystander.

OK. That is what you have reduced Stacks actions to in this discussion. I do not agree or believe you. He burned down his own house and flew his airplane into the IRS building because he could not work a payment plan out with the government. Nothing to see here...please move along.

Personally I don't care a crap about Stack or his tax issues other than the method he chose to protest.

Now we have "protest zones" miles from the point of the reason of the protest and the sheeple allow that to happen.

The media is controlled by the very same people that contribute most to the problems that need protest. Only a complete moron buys into a lost baby is "BREAKING NEWS" but a 10,000 strong protest gets zero coverage.

What I like is that this guy took away the defenses of the Ivory Tower by using an airplane. The guy got on the TV for you morons to gawk at. Good for him. Next time I hope it is a big twin full of explosives and a block on K street blown to smitherinies. There are no innocents. That is a myth propogated by the guilty.

Ya that's it twat. I fear government...in your mind... so maybe I will fear you.

Why don't you give the FBI or the DEA a ringy lingy and ask if they think I fear them. Don't take my word for it.

But.... this thread isn't about me and it surely isn't about you. This thread is about a plane crashing into a building with discussion ensuing pertaining to how this occured.

You being a pussy will take whatever positiion allows you to have big brothers dick deep up your ass. Me not so much.

I like the method of protest. If you don't that is understandable. You, being a coward, will never take a stand on anything of value.

Nah, i'm not a snitch. Snitches are bitches.

I took my stand over in the middle east. I make my stand here in the states by voting against the pigs who are attempting to destroy this great country.

Nice to know you supported a murderous moonbat, and the taking of an innocent life. It lets us all know the mindset of someone when dealing with them in the future.

Ya that's it twat. I fear government...in your mind... so maybe I will fear you.

Why don't you give the FBI or the DEA a ringy lingy and ask if they think I fear them. Don't take my word for it.

But.... this thread isn't about me and it surely isn't about you. This thread is about a plane crashing into a building with discussion ensuing pertaining to how this occured.

You being a pussy will take whatever positiion allows you to have big brothers dick deep up your ass. Me not so much.

I like the method of protest. If you don't that is understandable. You, being a coward, will never take a stand on anything of value.

 

Nah, i'm not a snitch. Snitches are bitches.

I took my stand over in the middle east. I make my stand here in the states by voting against the pigs who are attempting to destroy this great country.

Nice to know you supported a murderous moonbat, and the taking of an innocent life. It lets us all know the mindset of someone when dealing with them in the future.

 

Your stand? Ya right. I applaud your misguided motivation... but to claim it was your stand suggests you are Cheneys love child and expect him to leave a little sumpin in his will for ya.

Albiet my motives have always been for the most part selfish...I would never risk my life so Haliburton or some multinational oil corp could enrich themselves.

Don't expect me to believe for a second that the people that suckered you into wrapping yourself in the flag were doing anything more or less than grabbing power, money or fullfilling some personal goal like making up for a dissappointment in thier fathers failure to finish the job.

AND...Don't even start about innocent life... unless you would like to explain how many innocent Iraqis you have killed directly or indirectly for the enrichment of Bush, Cheney or thier pals. If you consider that patriotic then you are a bigger fool than I already guessed.

But this thread isn't about how tough and patriotic you think you are. It is about using airplanes as a tool of protest.

And you obviously agree that using planes to kill innocents is perfectly acceptable.

Interesting.

FYI, I never directly or indirectly killed ANY innocent civilians in Iraq. My units mission was a lil more cut & dry. A lil' more to the point. Same goes for Afghanistan.

Know what you are talking about before blindly pointing fingers.
 
 
 
 
I don't think not wanting to pay your taxes is a valid reason to kill an innocent bystander.

 

OK. That is what you have reduced Stacks actions to in this discussion. I do not agree or believe you. He burned down his own house and flew his airplane into the IRS building because he could not work a payment plan out with the government. Nothing to see here...please move along.

Personally I don't care a crap about Stack or his tax issues other than the method he chose to protest.

Now we have "protest zones" miles from the point of the reason of the protest and the sheeple allow that to happen.

The media is controlled by the very same people that contribute most to the problems that need protest. Only a complete moron buys into a lost baby is "BREAKING NEWS" but a 10,000 strong protest gets zero coverage.

What I like is that this guy took away the defenses of the Ivory Tower by using an airplane. The guy got on the TV for you morons to gawk at. Good for him. Next time I hope it is a big twin full of explosives and a block on K street blown to smitherinies. There are no innocents. That is a myth propogated by the guilty.

 

He is a FUCKING MURDERER!!!! He is not some kind of "FREEDOM FIGHTER" he is a tax dodging SCUM BAG who left his wife and child HOMELESS!!! How can you POSSIBLY DEFEND this PUKE!!!???
 
 
 
 
 
Sorry we can't agree on this one Rob. I wish there were a hundred more like him. The filthy and the rich have made our votes worthless and need to be first taught who they are fucking with then bombed into submitting to the will of the people and the letter of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

 

You know......we'd agree if the dude had gone in and shot the IRS agent. Then, no buildings get destroyed, and nobody dies except the person who is a direct representative of the government. I mean.......they brought guns to rallies that had nothing to do with guns, right?

I'm of the opinion that crashing an aircraft into a federal building, intentionally, to cause great unrest and to make a point, is terrorism. And, coming on the heels on 9/11 (at which time I was still active duty), I just think it's fucked up.

If you're really pissed at the government do something, but leave the buildings standing.

We're in a recession for fuck's sake. It's expensive to rebuild stuff.

 

Good people gettin squeezed outta thier houses... dyin for lack of health care and you worried about the budget?

There was a time when this country could have reached higher and become truly great but Carter screwed the pooch and allowed that snake Reagan in the door to start our country on this long downward spiral. If Carter had an ounce of balls he would have sent out hit squads to knock off the collaborators in the CIA and NSA and republican party that worked out a deal with Kehomenie to release the 50 Iranian hostages on the very fuckin day Reagan infected our country with his presidency. That was the beginning of the end and now that the fascists have thier tentacles firmly gripping all fascets of our "democracy". There is little left that anyone can do to effect recovery of this country back to the citizens. Blood must be spilt. Corporate blood. Judicial blood....and most definitly lobbiest blood. Traitors must pay for what they do. Call it terrorism..I really don't give a fuck. What name do you have even in your dreams for those that have taken so much of our treasury and the lives of our finest...or don't you dare dream about it? If you did you must take a side...your dream perspective.

We need a hundred Stacks to get thier attention. One guy won't cut it. The vermin will not give up unless they believe stealing from our country and commiting treason is not worth dying over. What is thought about cleaning up these scum by those too cowardly to live life more than a cow or a pig in the stockyard awaiting thier demise is irrellevant.

 

Tell you what Huggy how about you put your money where your mouth(ass) is. Go kill yourself by flying a plane into a building. Just make sure it is a CORPORATE office (UNDER CONSTRUCTION) with NO INOCENT people inside!!!
 
 
 
I know Im hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand. It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country, and it isnt limited to the blacks, and poor immigrants. I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after. But I also know that by not adding my body to the count, I insure nothing will change. I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at big brother while he strips my carcass, I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me, I choose not to pretend that business as usual wont continue; I have just had enough.

I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are. Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasnt so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.

I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, lets try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well.

First of all you are breaking rules left and right trying to get me to commit suicide...so lighten up. I don't really care about Stack. But ya I do admire his method...but like I said repeatedly I would not fly a plane into a government building.... How do you feel about lobbiests?

Why that is just plain stinkin thinkin my friend. What kinda shape would we be in right now if our forefathers worked within the rules?.... Lived thier lives as you aspire to. I dare say we would still be speaking English and looking up to some faggy Royalty.

Treason? How would blowin up a few choice lobbiests be commitin the treason? I'm sorry Fusion... We will just have to agree to dissagree on that point.

Furthermore I submit that after the Bush regime...the "rules" regarding treason are not quite as clear cut as they used to be back in the day... Just ask the Wilsons...Valerie Plame.. Rules...shmooolze.

So, does that mean you 'admire' the method the Saudi hijackers used on 9-11???
 
 
I find my-self wanting to hate this man and at the same time finding it hard not to think that my own beliefs justify this action, I think this government is totally robbing the American Tax Payer which is me and Mr Stack, I think they are a totally illegal entity and that what they do is wholly unamerican. I also think that as a nation we have lost the power to control or even bridal this body they freely debate our economic future and though we may change some parts of this debate through election we will never shut them down, and why? Most Americans do not believe in the Fed and the bodies therein but still we are forced to endure them. So at what point do Americans who believe these bodies and the actions they take are illegal and indeed treasonous begin to take action? Maybe for Mr Stack it was the day he went for a cozy little flight. The people who work for these organizations are just as guilty as the bodies themselves, and in my opinion this is how revolution happens, from within, if we really feel this way why would we not take action? Just because someone lives in this country and are called Americans does not mean that they are American. Our founding fathers were very adamant about restraining our own government and they seen the possibility for it to grow out of control because this is the nature of governments. Indeed it maybe time to take action against illegal bodies of the US that are fleecing our pockets simply for their own greed. The way I see it is if 1 single penny gets taken out of my paycheck or anyone else in this country and that penny is spent on something we do not approve of from these public school failures, to a completely out sourced military, to any pork barrel spending that go to pet projects of senators who want to see themselves become lobbyists for some big corporation when leave office then we are being openly robbed and the strong arm mans weapon of choice is the IRS under the guise of doing your duty and being patriotic, this is bullshit, regardless of conservative liberals and libertarian disagreements none of us want politicians taking our money and doing whatever they want to do to line their own pockets. Do any of us disagree with that? No it is one of the things that we all agree on and I am not talking about the politicians who have weaseled their way into office. I am talking about you and I sitting their reading this post right now. Do YOU believe that their is money being taken from your family to fund things that the American people would not want? Do you know that the IRS is the one doing it? Of course you do. Now their is no doubt that what Joe Stack did was a terrorist attack and we have been brain washed against these. My fellow Americans was George Washington a terrorist, yes, was Thomas Pane, yes, did Thomas Jefferson warn us against the need for these type of actions yes my country men we are being treated like sheep, no more like cows our pockets picked off the backs of our labor to fund the greed of washington, stand up take action stop paying taxes to the government do you think they can lock us all up? No of course not. Tell your senator or rep you want a flat tax a fair tax across the board make these illegals pay their fair share, ask for a flat sales tax across the US. Demand that big corporations pay their own way and stop being allowed to move their money off shore. While you at it demand that companies stop moving over seas, do you know how this great little campaign in the 80s called by American Made, just look for the fucking tag, and stop paying these crooks. Maybe if a few more of them die they will stop going to work. I say fuck them.

Oh look! A trick question. No..it means I would like to slice a chunk out of a childs leg and cook it up in BBQ sauce... slice off succulent servings and wash it down with a fine Qianti.

But back to your fine question.... Well... yes and no. Being a pilot I don't see the need to hijack an airplane with truly innocent people on board. Christ the fuckin things are parked out in the open fully fueled all over the country. Perhaps I am a little more analyical than you and not so easily swayed by emotion. If you believe that 9/11 occured because Bin Ladin hated the way we live here in America you are a fool and this conversation is less than pointless. If you really want to intelligently discuss one of the most tragic attacks on our soil..then I'm game.

Lets start with the fact that Bin Ladin was and still is a multimillionair. His life style was far more "rich" than the average american. He was pissed about a few issues...the US air base in Rihahd...mostly... but intervention by the west in muslim countries was the overiding cause. Then (and now we are closing in on the chosen targets) Bin Ladin was having his access to his money found and cut off. This was done by Clinton. Most of the money tracking and confiscation was done in the Financial centers at the Twin Towers. He was acting on a grudge. The other targets were incidental. OK..does that give him the right? No. But we can't have it both ways. We accuse terrorists that hide behind civilians and hypocritically do the same thing. If we are doing whatever we need to within our law enforcement community to track, disable and capture actors like Bin Ladin we are fools to carry out these tasks in the midst of innocent civilians.

Now as to the tactic of flying a plane into ones enemies headquarters. Yes. Militarily it is as effective an attack as is possible.

Shall we extrapolate to another target...perhaps one that is attacking us. It is my honest belief that those that line our representatives pockets and corrupt the purpose of our elections that those vermin are traitors and should be stopped any way possible.

If someone stole a plane and loaded it up with explosives and flew it into the offices of the worst lobbiests on K street or the home offices of the filthy HMOs I wouldn't bat an eye.

I don't see how there are any "innocents" in those targets. Someone making a living in those environments is subverting our country and deserves the same fate as the guy that actually hands the money over to a congressman. These vermin are never going to have to answer for thier treachery by normal circumstance. Don't cry your crocadile tears. If something unfortunate should happen to these fucks.... lucky us. Sooner than later they would connect the dots and go away and corrupt some other country.
