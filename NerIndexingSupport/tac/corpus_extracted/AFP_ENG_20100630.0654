Burundi's opposition leader and former rebel chief has issued a recorded message
explaining why he went into hiding just days before country's controversial
presidential poll.

Agathon Rwasa -- leader of the Hutu National Liberation Forces (FNL), which laid
down its weapsons last year -- led opposition allegations that the government
had rigged local elections in May.

All opposition candidates boycotted Sunday's vote, in which incumbent President
Pierre Nkurunziza was the only candidate and which was accompanied by an upsurge
of violence in the central African nation.

"They're looking for me because I told the truth, because I said publically that
I don't accept the results of the local elections," Rwasa said in an audio
cassette that his entourage said Tuesday night was authentic.

"(Last) Wednesday they wanted to arrest me again. I got wind of it and I
disappeared from circulation," Rwasa added, without saying where he was speaking
from.

Rwasa left his home in Bujumbura's chic Kiriri district on Wednesday last week,
ostensibly to go to church. He has not been seen since.

A Burundian security official said he was believed to have crossed into the east
of the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with the help of local
militia.

Burundi's police have said they had never intended to arrest him but Rwasa
rejected their claim.

"If they say they weren't after me, how come they put more than 35 secret
service agents on my track in Uvira beacuse they thought that's where I was,"
Rwasa said, referring to a border town in DR Congo.

He urged the Burundi government and the electoral commission to "come to their
senses" and asked the country's opposition parties to remain united within the
Democratic Alliance for Change (ADC).

The ADC is leading opposition to the massive victory by Nkurunziza's ruling
party in the May 24 local elections.

At least ten people have been killed and more than 60 injured in a series of
grenade attacks and violent incidents since the local elections.
