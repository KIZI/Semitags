So basically I got the best marks I could have wished for in my exams, but well I put on 1 and a half stone in the process and I wasn't thin to begin with.

5 ft 3 1/2 inches. 11 stone 7 pounds.

I have no confidence, how am I going to be able to socialize at freshers week when everyone is look about half the size of me in wee dresses.

I seriously cannot stress to you enough how well I have ate and exercised. I lost 6 pounds very fast but I have been unable to lose anything since.

I have tried and my effort has no results. About 20 days until university, I am not excited, I wish to God I had have taken a year out.

I used to get complimented all the time on my looks and only 3 years ago was a size 8 and out every night. Some things happened with friends and then I got a boyfriend and my weight has just slowly went up and it literally was like very end of June I stepped on the scales and was just under 12 stone. Never been as heavy in my life.

This is a really long post but does anyone have any words of wisdom cause I am so depressed :-(
 
 
LOOK BOSS, at the end of the day, in freshers' week it's all about MEETING PEOPLE, not solely about getting some hole. If you're a nice person then people will make friends with you whatever you look like. And if you're actually looking for some action then I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT EITHER because lots of girls bigger than the size you describe get Loads Of Action. So chill out.

I'm not looking sex! For other people to want it lol. Thanks though, was having a bit of self pity. Not putting any on and maybe another 20 days of blood, sweat and tears and I'll be closer to my previous body.
 
 
You will not be the fat girl - others will be bigger than you and you are hardly that far off a healthy weight, don't worry  

Fwiw, I'm a lot bigger than you (size 18/20) and have yet to be called up on it by anyone at Uni. One of my friends is the same size as me, goes out in short showy dresses, exhudes confidence and is one of the most popular people I know. You'll be fine.
 
 
Why don't you go for a walk every morning as soon as you get out of bed? That didn't mean to sound harsh if it did but it's merely a suggestion. Or perhaps a bike ride of some sort. I'm in a similar situation to you, last year wasn't a good year for me. I got rejected by the girl I had liked for months amongst other things and the only way I could get out of it was by eating. I regret it now but it pulled me through. Appearance isn't everything, it's about what's inside and if you're a good person I don't see what the problem is. People should see you for who you really are and you shouldn't have to change to win their approval.
 
 
best find out where the nearest macys is :P
 
 
Tbh there are hardly any fat people at uni I have noticed. I have only ever seen 2 for the entire year.
 
 
I'm almost exactly the same height/weight as you, and I can assure that there are many people who are the same size or bigger.

However I too was at the heaviest I have ever been, and am currently dieting, and my advice to you is simply to keep going. I lost quite a few pounds quickly, then the weight loss leveled off and is much slower now. If you're going to lose weight healthily and keep it off, the best thing to do is persevere, and concentrate more on changing your long term eating habits.

But don't let your weight get in the way of enjoying yourself, confidence and personality shine through no matter what you weigh.
 
 
I'm worried about this too, tbh. (People on my course and others on the FB page for my uni all look skinny and gorgeous, and I'm, er, not.)
I've been dieting and I've lost a lot of weight from how I was, but I still have a long way to go to feel confident.

Everyone keeps saying that it doesn't matter whether you're fat or not once you get to uni because people are more mature and don't care about stuff like that as much as in secondary school/sixth form, but I think it's also a confidence issue. I know I don't feel as confident as a size 18 partying and flirting in short skirts as I would if I were a size 14.
 
 
I'm sure you'll make a lot of friends who will judge you on your personality, they'll judge me on my weirdness and won't like me  ....
 
 
Hey, really don't worry about your weight at all, life's too short just enjoy being at uni and meeting new people! Tbh i found i lost quite a bit of weight when i stopped worrying about it. I know it's easier said than done but seriously people only care about the type of person you are it really is about personality in my opinion. I really hope everything goes great for you  
 
 
Hit the gym, eat a 500 calorie deficit, lose weight. Its not complicated, your not "genetically predisposed" to be fat or anything crap like that.

If being overweight (trust me im lighter than you and im 6 foot 1 and male lol) makes you feel you have no confidence then lose weight and your confidence will soar
 
 
 
I seriously cannot stress to you enough how well I have ate and exercised. I lost 6 pounds very fast but I have been unable to lose anything since.

 

I'm sorry, but it comes down to science: Calories out > Calories in = Lose weight.

If being overweight makes you feel so terrible why don't you focus on how to solve this problem? I don't mean just doing some exercise when you feel like it and "trying" to eat well... to get results you have to become obsessed; you need to make this your one and only goal. Write out strict gym and diet routines and STICK to them - count your calories each day and make sure you have a deficit and you WILL lose weight.

Losing fat is a lot simpler than gaining muscle; literally just do hard cardio and eat under your maintenance calories with a balanced and clean diet. It's not difficult if you want it badly enough. I personally don't enjoy doing deadlifts and squats and forcing down ridiculous amounts of protein every day but you know what, I don't enjoy being a skinny kid even more. Just think about how happy you will be in the long term.

Up to you.

Because that comment will make her confidence "soar" so much...
 
 
I should have worded that differently, my point is theres no point saying oh im overweight thats just the way I am. You can change and it will improve your life in many ways
 
 
OP you can be my friend
 
 
I feel like this, but mostly because I'm really short. Worried I'll just get trampled on all the time.  
 
 
not thjat fat is it

You will make friends whatever your size. People who blame their being fat on having no friends are using a poor excuse for the fact that they don't have an attractive personality. When you start uni your weight shouldn't matter. Keep trying to shift it by living a healthy lifestyle and draw your confidence from that. It'll be fine.
 
 
For continued weight loss you will have to drop your calories when you stall as because you are losing weight your BMR will be going down.

I'm sure you'll be fine though.
 
 
seriously you gotta realise that everyone at freshers week are going to be much too concerned about how they are coming across to all these new people to really even register that you are overweight.
 
 
You won't be the only fat girl, and you certainly won't be the fattest.
 
 
Look on the bright side, apparently fat girls get more cock because they can't be as fussy. Freshers week will be good fun for you in that case.
 
 
 
So basically I got the best marks I could have wished for in my exams, but well I put on 1 and a half stone in the process and I wasn't thin to begin with.

5 ft 3 1/2 inches. 11 stone 7 pounds.

I have no confidence, how am I going to be able to socialize at freshers week when everyone is look about half the size of me in wee dresses.

I seriously cannot stress to you enough how well I have ate and exercised. I lost 6 pounds very fast but I have been unable to lose anything since.

I have tried and my effort has no results. About 20 days until university, I am not excited, I wish to God I had have taken a year out.

I used to get complimented all the time on my looks and only 3 years ago was a size 8 and out every night. Some things happened with friends and then I got a boyfriend and my weight has just slowly went up and it literally was like very end of June I stepped on the scales and was just under 12 stone. Never been as heavy in my life.

This is a really long post but does anyone have any words of wisdom cause I am so depressed :-(

 

Hi i'm in a similar position to you. For the last year ive been so focused on my A levels and getting into uni, that I didnt realise that I put on a

I am also really self conscious, and aware that i am more overweight than my friends.

I plan to start the cabbage diet next week (after ramadan ends) as ive heard that (along with exercise) some ppl have lost a stone in a week by following this diet. maybe you could try a similar thing?
 
 
Signup to the gym asap, and don't be tempted by the cheap crappy food. I have trouble understanding how you get to the point of being almost 12st at 5ft 3
 
 
You're going to university. Unless your goal is to get laid a lot (which will happen irrespective of how you look given it's Freshers and everyone will be utterly wasted in clubs etc anyway, if you so wish it to be, you have it easier being a girl as well), you'll be absolutely fine. The only thing that will stop you from making friends with people is your self confidence. Of course simply telling you that isn't going to increase it, so get down the gym and get in shape. The fact that you'll look "better" won't do much to influence people's opinion of you really, but the confidence boost that you get from it will.

dont worry about it, why dont you start the gym and slowly work out at your own level, step by step im sure you can reach the level which you prefer

LOL your freshers week sounds boring.
 
 
You'll find that many people feel the way you do.......that's what uni is about, meeting new people and that's the last thing they will focus on during freshers week tbh......so chillax and enjoy yourself OP.
 
 
That a girl is fat is the first thing most guys recognise about a woman.

And you are one of these guys right???......

OP, eat loads of fruits and vegetable, chicken, fish, turkey, drink at least 1 litre of water a day...dont eat too much bread and dont eat heavy food before you sleep...and exercise...

You wont lose 3 stones in 20 days but you can try....
 
 
Listen I know that feeling I'm gonna' be the fatty lol! But yeah people who judge you on that aren't worth your time of day to be fair.
 
 
Eat everything within a small plate size, like the dessert plate.

Do a lot of sport activities, at least walking and find alternatives like using stairs instead of elevator for example.

Should work much better than a diet even.

There will be plenty of fat loads at uni. All you need to do is lose weight, you can lose it all in your first year and then after that people will always be like "oh my god you lost so much weight whats your secret blah blah blah"

So if you go out drinking all the time and eat real bad food (like all new students) you are a ****wit.

If you go to the gym or go jogging every day and eat good food, you are sensible, and you will lose weight.
 
 
I was just talking about this issue here and it may help you
 http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/show...1#post33719671 

If you continue being insecure, people will feel the negative vibes and will stay away from you. Looking good and being at a healthy weight is important, but it's not all you should be focusing on. Trust me, keep a good diet, eat goodies but don't overdo it, enjoy life and have fun, stay active and go to university with your head held high and you'll be just fine! As long as you're not obese in the literal sense and if you have a good personality, there isn't much you should be worrying about   really. I swear. Seen people in your exact situation and they have many friends. Why would you even want a friend who judges you over your weight????

Nothing will put people off more than insecurity.

I don't mean to be horrible (and actually I am certainly not thin myself), but the fact is that you can't do anything about it in time for freshers' week, so if you go in feeling bad about yourself people will mistake it for unfriendliness. In fact, you will probably put on more weight if you feel bad about yourself.

Just go in there and make their first impression of you a confident, smiling person. No-one worthwhile will judge you in the long term on anything other than personality.  
 
 
Oh my god I'm in EXACTLY THE SAME situation... I'm actually dreading being the really short tubby girl because everyone else who I've added on facebook so far is either long and lithe or small and slim, URGH
 
 
There is always a bigger fish.
 
 
I'm sorry but if you want you can lose weight. You can't complain about something but do nothing about it. I've nothing against bigger people who've accepted it and don't care that they're a little heavier, but people who continue to eat a little too much and whine about it surly realise with some effort they can be a size they won't complain about.
 
 
 
Oh my god I'm in EXACTLY THE SAME situation... I'm actually dreading being the really short tubby girl because everyone else who I've added on facebook so far is either long and lithe or small and slim, URGH

 

Don't be so negative on yourself! You really probably aren't the biggest person there, no ones going to care, be happy and confident and you'll be far more attractive than a girl whose a few pounds less. And actually, this goes to you and OP, you should realise that weight has little to do with how pretty/ attractive you are. (as long as you're not too big or thin, because extremes can indeed be pretty ugly but im talking extremes here!) Have fun at uni, I regret taking a gap year now.

you should relax. you dont need to be skinny, nor do you need to be fat. jst make sure you dont go through too much trouble for sizes.. i kinda like a girl to be a bit chubby. you know like the mediocre chubby... seriously you arent heavy.. at all  
 
 
I wouldn't worry about it too much, as long you aren't at a point where you can't even move to do exercise, there's still hope yet.  

People have said it already, but the people you want to be friends with, will not care about your weight/outward appearance.

I'm 4ft 10 (Chinese, I'm obliged to be short.) and around 11 stone, I've always been on the fat side.
Hopefully some weight will be lost at uni whenever I hit the gym/cannot eat as much due to finances!  
 
 
I'm surprised at the suggestion of being able to lose a stone in a week. That's just not possible if the weight loss is supposed to be only/primarily fat loss. 1kg of body fat gives 7700kcal, so you have to eat 7700kcal less than you need in order to burn a kilo. Whether you do that in a week or a fortnight is up to you. But the point is: one's daily energy expenditure isn't even half of that, more like a quarter or a third. What's realistic is losing 1kg or 1.5kg a week, maybe up to 2kg a week, but that would be a daily deficit of 2200kcal. I don't think that's healthy.
 
 
Babe, I'm 5'7 and 192lbs.

Also, whose standards are you trying to meet up to, your own, other women's, or men who might possibly give you a ONS? I mean for God's sake is it really that important, and if it is, why don't you try dieting and going to the uni's gym?

I'm personally happy with my weight (as is my boyfriend) but I've been trying to lose weight on health grounds.
 
 
I oughta kick your goddamn ass you fat funky bitch you needa get off ya ass and lose some of that goddamn weight xx
 
 
 
You will not be the fat girl - others will be bigger than you and you are hardly that far off a healthy weight, don't worry

I honestly don't understand why some girls do that. Do they think they look good on it? God, the times I've seen really fat girls with unbelievably short dresses, their fat skin extruding from every corner of their clothes  
I used to be size 20 myself, but at least I had the dignity (and self awareness) to cover myself up.
Now, as to the worries you have OP, just because you are overweight it doesn't mean you won't have friends. As daisydaffodil said, and as I have experienced myself, people approach you because they like your character. Be confident about yourself (yeah, wearing too short and revealing clothes is not in my opinion a sign of confidence, you can look beautiful in clothes appropriate for your body type)
Tbh though you are not that overweight, if you are careful for a few months you can lose the weight

I calculated her bmi. She's obese.
 
 
 
I calculated her bmi. She's obese.

 

BMI is a very crude tool to be honest, it doesn't account for muscle or bigger frames. I mean if it's creeping up that high obviously there's an issue from a health perspective but super-skinny just looks wrong (and can't happen due to body type) on some people. I mean look at Beyonce - she's bootylicious but her ass physically won't get smaller in respect to the rest of her body because that's her body type >_>
 
 
Go jogging every other day.
By the time these 20 days are up yo should be able to run 10 miles in 1 go. If you do this you will lose a lot of weight
 
 
 
 
Every uni has a gym and it's usually really cheap. Get yourself in the gym once you start, and watch what you eat. Quite simply, if you burn 800 calories in the gym, make sure you eat less than 800 calories..and you'll start to lose weight. It's not a terminal thing to be overweight; if you really want to lose it, all you gotta do is put the hard work in.

With that said, uni isn't like school anyway. People won't give a **** how fat someone is, but if you're serious about it then it's a very simple road and there will be people to help you!

Plus, you'll tend to find that you lose a bit of weight when you go to uni anyway, cause you don't really eat properly! I wish you the best of luck OP!

 

I think this is a bit misleading and also kind of unhealthy. Beyond 500 calories and you're supposedly burning muscle, and most likely won't have the energy to go the following day. Burning 800 calories in the space of one workout(i.e an hour and a half) is very hard.

Not only that but you're not taking into account the fact that most of the calories she'll be burning will be from her basal metabolic rate. If she were to burn 800 calories and then eat less than 800 calories too, that's a net loss of least half a pound a day, which I'm incredibly sceptical to say is a healthy rate.

I don't know if maybe I'm being a bit ott but I just see it a lot were people say burn x amount and eat less than x amount, when it's perfectly possible to just burn say 300 calories a day and have a relatively restrictive diet.

lol
not tough enough, - '3 miles in 2months'- despicable

Don't stop running till you're about to throw up or faint
 
 
Your weight isn't the problem - it's your thinking that is broken.

i.e. you shouldn't let your (perception of your) personal appearance dominate the basis of your self esteem.

Getting real though, from your stats, you sound a little chubby but hardly massively fat. There will be loads of other girls in a similar position, many still carrying puppy fat but many of them will have self esteem and confidence so people won't notice that they are a bit heavy. Or at least they won't be 'fat girls' - they will be thought of as friends or some girl who happen to be overweight as an afterthought - not their sole characteristic.

You may find that the new setting and meeting new friends boosts your confidence. Hopefully, you would use that get involved in new sports and activities (think how much opportunity there is for that!) and you will naturally shed the weight quite quickly.
 
 
You are stressing about this way too much.

You are really not that big. You might be a bit overweight on the BMI charts, so what, you're not so big that people won't see your personality! I know people twice your size who have tons of friends. You might not be happy with your weight but it ain't gonna stop you making friends if you want to. What will stop you is you obsessing about it. When I started uni I weighed 15 stone and I made tons of friends because, although I wanted to be healthier (and am now), I didn't let it affect my self esteem.

I don't even think about people's weight when I am talking to them, unless they are really noticeably huge or tiny. Even then I don't really think anything of it - it certainly wouldn't stop me wanting to be friends with them. Only shallow people who aren't worth befriending care about this kind of stuff.

I know but a bmi of around 30 is still worrying. I totalloy agree that op should do it for her health though, not just to look 'skinny'.
 
 
 
I calculated her bmi. She's obese.

 

Okay, then she should start losing it steadily, not getting depressed about it or messing her life over it. She should do it more for her health, not to be 'accepted' by people. Those people who may judge her won't matter in her life apart from the part where they make her feel bad about herself.
 
 
Honestly anyone who wants to lose weight needs to google Gary Taubes. Do it!
 
 
Hey OP! Are you me? Same stats re: height + weight. Depressing isn't it? All that revision and work and worry and depression then zing! you have the grade you need and then you get on the scales and think aaah.

You won't be the only one. And its not worth getting depressed about it. We are going to uni! Whole new lifestyle minus the pre- and post- exam depressive cookie eating. We are going to lose weight like crazy when we are there, constantly doing things, going places, rather than sat behind a desk static. Don't let it spoil your Freshers and getting to know people. Chances are, people will be impressed as they watch you shrink.
 
 
People will think you'll make great sandwiches. You'll have no problem befriending people.
 
 
Just don't eat a lot at uni, it's not that hard as you'll be buying your own food.
 
 
Im LOLLing so bad at all the people on this thread who are like "Its so easy, I don't understand how you could get so big." Who runs your lives? Let me guess, you live in a small town or city and go to a state secondary school with a short commute by public transport. You have at least 1 working parent, possibly a sibling and nobody has any mental or physical disabilities in your house.

It is easy for you to be normal sized, yes. But for others, getting to the gym might involve booking a carer, or walking down a duel carriageway. Don't be so quick to judge. You have nooooo idea about other people's lives.

lmao this takes the biscuit, you can always trust a fatty to make excuses for why they've let themselves go

>implying your life is so hard you cannot lose weight
>implying that because you face a few difficulties you cannot cook and prepare healthy meals
>implying you have so many responsibilities you cannot get away for 20 minutes to do some interval training

Stop whining and lose some weight fatty

 
We are going to lose weight like crazy when we are there, constantly doing things, going places, rather than sat behind a desk static. Don't let it spoil your Freshers and getting to know people. Chances are, people will be impressed as they watch you shrink.

 

no you won't, majority of girls come out of uni bigger than they went in

 
Listen I know that feeling I'm gonna' be the fatty lol! But yeah people who judge you on that aren't worth your time of day to be fair.

 

Everyone judges everyone else on appearance, so by this logic no one is worth your time

 
BMI is a very crude tool to be honest, it doesn't account for muscle or bigger frames. I mean if it's creeping up that high obviously there's an issue from a health perspective but super-skinny just looks wrong (and can't happen due to body type) on some people. I mean look at Beyonce - she's bootylicious but her ass physically won't get smaller in respect to the rest of her body because that's her body type &gt;_&gt;

 

BMI is crude for someone like an athlete, when you're dealing with an 18 year old girl who doesn't exercise however....

 
I'm sorry but if you want you can lose weight. You can't complain about something but do nothing about it. I've nothing against bigger people who've accepted it and don't care that they're a little heavier, but people who continue to eat a little too much and whine about it surly realise with some effort they can be a size they won't complain about.

 

This
 
 
This is going to sound like utterly stupid nonsense, but it's worked so I may as well share.

I find a combination of extreme stress and worry in tandem with a spiraling drink problem works wonders for weight loss. I am 5'8, male, and was 11 stone 5 or so after doing lots of muscle bulking in the gym. I stopped going, got myself an emotionally draining, parasitic girlfriend and started drinking at all hours of the day and i'm now hovering at around nine stone. People have said I look much better with a slim frame, i've had ridiculous compliments and my slimmer frame even directly contributed to me getting laid (showed girl my stomach, slept with her that evening.)

I'm not saying you should just start binge drinking and get yourself all stressed, but the stress you may experience in worrying about being (as you put it) 'fat' may actually help you to lose weight.

(By the way, the demon-witch of a girlfriend I mentioned was about 5'2 and 10 stone 5. She could have easily had another stone on her and been just as or more attractive. Learn a lesson from the great anthem; most guys do in fact "love big butts and cannot lie".)
 
 
 
I think this is a bit misleading and also kind of unhealthy. Beyond 500 calories and you're supposedly burning muscle, and most likely won't have the energy to go the following day. Burning 800 calories in the space of one workout(i.e an hour and a half) is very hard.

Not only that but you're not taking into account the fact that most of the calories she'll be burning will be from her basal metabolic rate. If she were to burn 800 calories and then eat less than 800 calories too, that's a net loss of least half a pound a day, which I'm incredibly sceptical to say is a healthy rate.

I don't know if maybe I'm being a bit ott but I just see it a lot were people say burn x amount and eat less than x amount, when it's perfectly possible to just burn say 300 calories a day and have a relatively restrictive diet.

 

I hear you. 800 was just a random number.
 
 
 
So basically I got the best marks I could have wished for in my exams, but well I put on 1 and a half stone in the process and I wasn't thin to begin with.

5 ft 3 1/2 inches. 11 stone 7 pounds.

I have no confidence, how am I going to be able to socialize at freshers week when everyone is look about half the size of me in wee dresses.

I seriously cannot stress to you enough how well I have ate and exercised. I lost 6 pounds very fast but I have been unable to lose anything since.

I have tried and my effort has no results. About 20 days until university, I am not excited, I wish to God I had have taken a year out.

I used to get complimented all the time on my looks and only 3 years ago was a size 8 and out every night. Some things happened with friends and then I got a boyfriend and my weight has just slowly went up and it literally was like very end of June I stepped on the scales and was just under 12 stone. Never been as heavy in my life.

This is a really long post but does anyone have any words of wisdom cause I am so depressed :-(

 

Don't sit in a pool of your self pity - go out and do something about it.

You can lose 2lbs a week by fixing your diet and going to the gym a few days a week. Read up on nutrition & exercise. Make sure when you go to the gym you do both resistance and cardio exercise.

University is the perfect opportunity for you to get involved in doing more exercise, you have full control over your diet and can truly turn this around.

People won't shun you because you're fat. People will shun you if you're really awkward. Just try to be confident and you'll be fine.
 
 
 
And you are one of these guys right???......

OP, eat loads of fruits and vegetable, chicken, fish, turkey, drink at least 1 litre of water a day...dont eat too much bread and dont eat heavy food before you sleep...and exercise...

You wont lose 3 stones in 20 days but you can try....

 

oh yeahhhh, i love me a fat chick  
 
 
Just loose it, you can loose 2 stone in 2 month, by christmas you will look lovely again!

I used to be like you, quite recently actually but my mum taught me that beauty comes from within. And you seem like a lovely person, so you don't have anything to worry about  

That said, if you want to lose weight then do it for YOURSELF, not other people.

Best wishes xx
 
 
 
Every uni has a gym and it's usually really cheap. Get yourself in the gym once you start, and watch what you eat. Quite simply, if you burn 800 calories in the gym, make sure you eat less than 800 calories..and you'll start to lose weight. It's not a terminal thing to be overweight; if you really want to lose it, all you gotta do is put the hard work in.

With that said, uni isn't like school anyway. People won't give a **** how fat someone is, but if you're serious about it then it's a very simple road and there will be people to help you!

Plus, you'll tend to find that you lose a bit of weight when you go to uni anyway, cause you don't really eat properly! I wish you the best of luck OP!

 

bad advice.

Let me guess, you live in a small town or city and go to a state secondary school with a short commute by public transport.

It is easy for you to be normal sized, yes. But for others, getting to the gym might involve booking a carer, or walking down a duel carriageway. Don't be so quick to judge. You have nooooo idea about other people's lives.

 

People like you are one of the biggest reasons the country is massively overweight. Look at your post, just look at it. It's one big excuse. If people start taking responsibility and stop overloading crap into their mouths, then the 'boo hoo my life is so hard' stories become irrelevant.

 
You are stressing about this way too much.

You are really not that big. You might be a bit overweight on the BMI charts

 

She's borderline obese, and almost the same weight as me (5ft 11 male, decent muscle mass). The only reason she might not be 'big' is that she is 5 ft3, making her more 'round'.

 
, so what, you're not so big that people won't see your personality! I know people twice your size who have tons of friends.

 

Re-read the thread title; it's about being the fat girl. I'm sure she has a personality, but that's ignoring the issue at hand.

 
You might not be happy with your weight but it ain't gonna stop you making friends if you want to. What will stop you is you obsessing about it.

 

She is clearly not happy. You know what's going to make her more unhappy? Brushing it under the carpet it like you suggest. Obsessing about something that's having such a profound effect on your life might not be such a bad thing.

 
I don't even think about people's weight when I am talking to them, unless they are really noticeably huge or tiny. Even then I don't really think anything of it - it certainly wouldn't stop me wanting to be friends with them. Only shallow people who aren't worth befriending care about this kind of stuff.

 

This is worthy of a whole different thread, but if somebody neglects their body to their extent of it being a health risk, making note of that transcends 'shallow' and the observer starts to question the personality, mental issues and other factors which have allowed somebody to let themselves get into that state.

P.s a_t is bang on the money

BMI is crude if you are some kind of athlete. For the average person, if the bmi says you are obese then you probably are.

lol fatty.
 
 
I'm the fat girl. I have friends, I go out, I get male attention, I have a good time, and I enjoy myself.

It doesn't matter what size you are, it's all about the confidence and wearing things that suit and flatter your figure.
 
 
invest in a corset
noone will even notice if you're big
you get the confidence back cuz you look GREAT
and you still get to eat what you want
bob's your uncle, it's what I do

This

 

Am saying none of the above. Am pointing out that being attractive is one of the many things in life you have to work at and many people have other priorities and demands on their time. You prioritise being fit and attractive over, it would seem, being polite or friendly.

Allowing yourself to get stuck in a rut and become obese is because "my life sucks" is irresponsible and deserving of no sympathy. Taking on a little temperory weight gain for the sake of a higher goal, eg. getting into university, caring for a fragile person, shows that you understand there is more to life than the size of your ass!

The number on the scales goes up and down according to events in your life. I doubt very much that you would, say, advocate locking a person with severe dementia in on their own whilst you trot off to the gym. Take it easy troll, the world is bigger and more complicated than you know.
 
 
i refuse to believe you've done everything   - lets be honest here if you were that keen on fresher's day you would have lost weight ages ago!
 
 
Wow, modern media has really ****ed up today's females...

I feel sorry for you, being brainwashed into this obese-ophobic mindset
 
 
 
lol fatty.

 

Well, what I meant was I used to be obssessed with my weight, thinking I was fat and such. I'm a size 8/10.

But yeah, like other people have said, we're controlled by the media and how they think we should look like. Its all so stupid really.
 
 
Fat girls ride better

You didn't explicitly say any of the above, no. You just implied them heavily in your post

And your whole post was a list of excuses for why you're a bit of a fat mess, and yet I do not see a single reason why you cannot have a good healthy diet, not one

And did I say lock someone up while you go to the gym? No, I said that you saying you cannot get away for 20-30 mins to do some cardio is *******s, which it is

If you're not gonna take initiative and just make excuses, which is all you've done so far, and which is pretty much all you've done in your reply to me, you will always be fat, so there's no point whining about it, just deal with it fatty, and don't expect me to be nice to people who whine and make excuses, I have no sympathy for you at all when it comes to your body
 
 
Another thread about someone crying that they are fat.

Well, okay, you can cry about it or you can do something to change it. It's not difficult at all... In the process, you may find you actually ENJOY cardio or lifting weights.

Now, stop eating that half-tear filled tub of Ben and Jerry's, buy a gym membership and lift some damn weights until you feel you're about to die. Then, do some ****ing cardio!

Rinse and repeat. In the end, you may look nice and I might - just might - consider having sex with you.
 
 
 
Because that comment will make her confidence "soar" so much...

 

Why not? At least she knows she can kick his ass if he says anything to her :P.. 11 stone @ 6 ft 1 is pretty skinny!
 
 
You need to eat better an exercise more. Once you get through freshers I'd join the uni gym and really go for it. Not being rude or anything but I know you stated that you're eating well and exercising and just can't lose weight, but obviously your being slightly delusional in your efforts. Unless you have underlying problems (which I doubt) you simply aren't doing enough exercise or still eating too much. I say this from experience I know loads of people who say the same story, I myself said it at one point but in a reverse situation (wanting to bulk up but couldn't-said I ate loads). I'm not having a go at all just trying to help. Try not to think about it during freshers, most people won't care about your size. Just meet new people and have fun.

Im not asking for your sympathy, good lord no. Don't want, don't need. Im trying to show you that not everything is as black and white as you believe but its clearly not working. Aah well, I tried. Whilst by Christmas I will have ceased to be fat it seems that you will continue to be immature for at least the forseeable future. "Don't whine about it" - Im not. "You will always be fat" but then I should "Take [the] initiative" - you make so little sense.

Scale, perspective, cause and effect, shades of grey.

"And did I say lock someone up while you go to the gym?" Noooo, I said that, as a hypothesis. You clearly don't get it, and I have to pack for uni so Im not going to waste the internet continuing, I will simply say that you should get out and see a bit more of the world before you start telling people what to with their time. Weight is temporary, is it not worth ignoring the gym for a year or so to work towards something that will change your or somebody elses life for the better? Or for you is it the case that being a bit overwight makes life not worth living? I dunno, your priorities seem a bit screwy to me.  
 
 
 
Hit the gym, eat a 500 calorie deficit, lose weight. Its not complicated, your not "genetically predisposed" to be fat or anything crap like that.

If being overweight (trust me im lighter than you and im 6 foot 1 and male lol) makes you feel you have no confidence then lose weight and your confidence will soar

 

jesus i made a mistake lol, no need to call the feminist neg rating brigade
 
 
i'm sure people at university have grown out of the whole "ew you're fat i don't like you" school-pupil attitude. relax, the only person that will be worried or concerned or even care about your appearance is you. it will solely be a personal greivance which isn't going to be shared by anyone else

So basically your hypothesis is a load of nonsense you pulled out of your ass which has absolutely zero situational relevance to the matter in hand? Great ok, glad we cleared that one up, so your entire argument is based on not only a terrible excuse, but also a non existent one eh?

And trust me I've seen a lot more of the world than you have, don't you worry little fresher
 
 
Such a nice bloke.
Toodlepip.
 
 
 
I'm not looking sex! For other people to want it lol. Thanks though, was having a bit of self pity. Not putting any on and maybe another 20 days of blood, sweat and tears and I'll be closer to my previous body.

 

You need to overcome the pain of working out if you want to maintain a healthy weight.
 
 
 
Tbh there are hardly any fat people at uni I have noticed. I have only ever seen 2 for the entire year.

 

This is hysterical  
 
 
Well, you have 3 (or maybe even more, depending on what course you're doing) years in uni. There's enough time in 6 months or even less, to lose 2 stone which will help your confidence. You know what you need to do, so I don't think there's any words of wisdom that can be given that isn't already said. There are 'shortcuts' to losing weight quickly which do work, which I'm sure you know, but I'm not going to really say.
 
 
 
GRENADE

 

“Pauly D. was with the grenade.…When you go into battle, you need to have some friends with you, so that just in case a grenade gets thrown at you, one of your buddies takes it first
 
 
 
So basically I got the best marks I could have wished for in my exams, but well I put on 1 and a half stone in the process and I wasn't thin to begin with.

5 ft 3 1/2 inches. 11 stone 7 pounds.

I have no confidence, how am I going to be able to socialize at freshers week when everyone is look about half the size of me in wee dresses.

I seriously cannot stress to you enough how well I have ate and exercised. I lost 6 pounds very fast but I have been unable to lose anything since.

I have tried and my effort has no results. About 20 days until university, I am not excited, I wish to God I had have taken a year out.

I used to get complimented all the time on my looks and only 3 years ago was a size 8 and out every night. Some things happened with friends and then I got a boyfriend and my weight has just slowly went up and it literally was like very end of June I stepped on the scales and was just under 12 stone. Never been as heavy in my life.

This is a really long post but does anyone have any words of wisdom cause I am so depressed :-(

 

I'm going bald and I'm only 18 - how do you think I feel? At least you can gain back your physique; I can't gain back my hair.

Dunno why people have negged you for this   tbh with that height and weight it's possible that you look nicer than you think, I know people with those kinda of proportions who are actually fit lol. If you are genuinely like, a fat person, to put it bluntly, well, everyone knows what a fat person looks like, people will get over it pretty quickly, and once they get to know you will not give a **** what you look like. Do you choose your friends based on their BMI?  
 
 
You're not going to be the biggest girl on campus. You're just not.
Weight loss often does slow down after the initial bigger loss, simply because you will have lost more water in the first couple of weeks. The weight you are losing now is fat and it is a slow process, but it needs to be. If you try to starve yourself your body will go into famine mode and will hang on to its fat store. Then when you do eat normally again it will put down an extra layer of fat just in case another famine comes along. Keep up the hard work but trust me, you aren't going to stand out.
Remember though that people are going to want to be your friend because they like you, no matter what size you are or what you look like. You are going to look back at this in a few weeks and wonder what you were so worried about.

Now get out there and start getting excited about Uni!  
 
 
Take it from someone who used to have zero confidence. :-)
I used to be about a size fourteen which I know isn't exactly huge but still made me feel really bad about myself, especially since I spent my days dancing next to size eights! I then lost about two stone in a few months which now makes me a size ten - twelve. I've got loads more confidence now and love performing in the center.
You actually don't sound 'fat' to me, but if you're serious about losing weight then it's all about motivation. I have a lot of motivation when it comes to studying and thought there was no reason I couldn't use that to lose weight. It seems like you worked really hard to get into university so you must have amazing motivation which you can use. You don't have to do boring tasks like going to the gym and eating things you really don't like. Just cut out things like chocolate, crisps and fizzy drinks completely and swap them for low calorie/fat alternatives. You could also take up a class which you'd enjoy, aerobics or zumba is a really good way to lose weight and it's enjoyable to.
As for freshers week? Seriously, there is nothing to worry about! I can guarantee there will be people much bigger. Plus, it's the first week at university, people aren't going to be going around judging people on their weight! You've worked hard to get to university and you really deserve to get the most out of it, nobody can tell you otherwise.
I wish you all the luck in the future. :-)
 
 
Meh, i find fat girls hot and more often they're nicer people, so,
