Are you kidding? Look at all the jobs the machines create: invent, production, program with updates, maintain, market & sell, fill. Look at the money in production time they save us. All versus the 1 teller they "may" replace.
It's just sad that our president is so eager to excuse away his own inept policies that his excuse is just as pathetic as the results of his policies.
 
 
Wow, lol.
 
 
Here's my guess...someone told him that the main reason unemployment is still so high is that we're seeing a structural shift..a mismatch of available labor skills and the demand for skills. This is true.

Going on to specifically talk about ATMs and airline kiosks shows lack of understanding, however. While possibly a part of the problems, increased automation is not the main cause or, in my opinion, an important one.
 
 
I will not use the self checkouts at stores because they do eliminate local jobs.
they do create jobs in Tiawan and China where the hardware is made though.
 
 
It's not even remotely related to the problem. These evil machines have been around for decades. Last time I checked they weren't recently invented to replace anyone. It's just reaching. It's a ridiculous distraction that the main steam media didn't even have the balls to call him on. I defy you to tell me the media isn't in his pocket after all the years of calling GWB stupid.
 
 
The President is not wrong. In just two years I've seen automation reduce the personnel size in my office by 30%.

How many humans have been replaced by sutomated Telephone systems.
Press 1 for the pharmacy, press 2 for lumber, press 3 to hear a duck quack, etc.
 
 
 
The President is not wrong. In just two years I've seen automation reduce the personnel size in my office by 30%.

 

That is not the reason we have high unemployment. Nor is it a contributing factor.

Now you guys can't have it both ways. Your all high on green or high tech energy. Don't you think that's gonna cost jobs as well as drive costs up because as we all know new tech always has a high price.

Because logically automation always replaces jobs. But that is not necessarily because your company had to do it to survive this downturn. Or are you seriously telling me your company wasn't going to advance technologically to keep pace with their competitors?
Did you even watch the first video?
My bank is hiring and yes it even has an atm.

ATM industry not happy about Obama comments
image/jpeg icon78526814.jpg

The Automated Teller Machine industry is not happy about President Obama's comments that the development of ATMs has cost jobs. Here's a sampling of some of the feedback I've been getting.

Mike Lee, CEO of the ATM Industry Association, emailed me the following response:
President Obama should never use ATMs as an example of how technology replaces human labor because ATMs today play a critical role in providing extensive employment in the ATM and cash-in-transit industries. In addition, ATMs provide an indispensible range of services to customers, including all-hours access to their own banked cash. With over 400,000 in America alone, ATMs have become the main distribution channel for the distribution of cash in all modern economies and cash remains by far the most popular form of payment by US consumers. The whole purpose of the invention of the ATM back in 1967 was to make cash available outside of bank hours, liberating citizens to access their banked money 24 x 7, a huge increase in convenience. Given these major roles of the ATM, it would be quite irrational to turn the clock back to the 1960s to a time before ATMs. Aimee Leeper, a spokeswoman for ATM manufacturer Triton Systems, which makes its machines in America and employees 200 people here, told me over the phone, "We're not in the business of taking American jobs. What I wish President Obama had thought of is that people want convenient access to their money. How crazy is that?"

sure its a contributing factor IN A WAY.....we have a machine that does the work of aprox. 100 clerks.....the Mail Processing Center 5-6 years ago had something like 400 people working there.....now two machines later they are down to aprox 150- 200 people.....most of those people either just retired or took Early outs.....but no one has been hired since 07......because of Automation.....

And 100 years ago most people worked in agriculture because it was labor intensive. 50 years ago the steel mills were thriving, in spite of not updating machinery that Germany and Japan had already brought online, which caused the demise of the steel industry in the US.
 
 
Its amazing how liberals continue to vilify technology. If these nutjobs had their way we'd be living in tents without electricity. They don't want nuclear energy, coal energy, oil energy....and now not even automation which make higher quality products, because 'hey that was once a union job!'
 
 
The President is full of shit! Obama is still trying to scapegoat his failure.

The plow & horse did not create permanent unemployment for farmers with hoes. The Steam Shovel did not do the same to ditch diggers & miners. There have been countless innovations throughout history that replace human labor. New jobs are always created by the advancements in lifestyles that outpaced the ones lost by labor replacing machine. If anything we have to many overeducated government dependent sissy's & to few blue collar workers to build oil pipelines & oil rigs, or operate drilling & mining equipment.

The only thing this country lacks is leadership.
 
 
 
The President is not wrong. In just two years I've seen automation reduce the personnel size in my office by 30%.

 

You have more ATMs in your office?
 
 
 
I saw a story on this in the news earlier today. The president's point was absolutely correct.

 

It was not even close to correct.

Let us look closer at the examples of ATMs themselves. Despite the fact that there are ATMs in every grocery and convenience store, every bank, and scattered on city streets all over the country there are many times more bank branches now than there were when the ATM was first used. In fact, the BLS predicted an increase in tellers of 6% before the recession.

 Tellers 

The facts do not support Obama's, or your, supposition. ATMs do not even eliminate jobs for tellers, they certainly cannot eliminate non teller jobs.
 
 
 
 
 
That is not the reason we have high unemployment. Nor is it a contributing factor.

Now you guys can't have it both ways. Your all high on green or high tech energy. Don't you think that's gonna cost jobs as well as drive costs up because as we all know new tech always has a high price.

We need to keep the old technology and not innovate because we should always support unions. We have to innovate because we are falling behind China. No wonder progressives are crazy.
 
 
Obama is upset because the ATM rejected his card.

I particularly enjoyed Boehner's press release.

 
I didnt do it.
 President Obama says Im to blame for high unemployment   part of the structural problems with the economy. Yes, he actually said my electronic brethren and I  who dispense cash and make lines move a little more quickly at the airport  are part of the reason  1.5 million fewer Americans have jobs  than when the stimulus was enacted.
But before the president fingered us as responsible for job losses, he sought to  take credit for the sluggish economy .
And even DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) said this morning that Democrats own the economy. I dont. Im just an ATM. I dont own anything.
So if there are any structural issues with our  faltering economy , as the president said, its likely because of his policies  not ATMs. For example:

 

I particularly liked this part.

 
SPENDING TOO MUCH: Democrats want to spend more of your money (and rack up more debt). I want you to spend it. The Democrats who run Washington spent almost a trillion dollars on a stimulus that didnt work (and bragged about it during   Recovery Summer  ) -- and they want to spend more! They havent passed a budget that spurs job growth and stops spending money we dont have (note:  Republicans have  ), and even worked with an  army of lobbyists  to fight spending cuts. You wont catch me spending any of your money; I just want you to have it.

In part, he's right.

And this trend where techology makes human workers redundant is NOT going away, either. In fact, it's only going to get worse (or better depending on whther you're benefiting from it or have lost your job to it)

15 years ago I had 6 part time workers and myself working on Rosetta.

Those people worked on scanning and cleaning images, plus one "engineer" whose sole job was to help us get and stay online

Collectively they put in about 180 hours a week. (admittedly, I put in about 80 hours a week then)

Now what they did, then, I and an engineer I have on retainer do all that work PLUS much more, too in about 20 hours a week.

I'd guesstimate that in my little project we have enjoyed about a 900% increase in efficiency in the last ten years.
 
 
 
To your jobs:

Hasta la vista, baby!

LOL, that is the spin.

I'd guesstimate that in my little project we have enjoyed about a 500% increase in efficiency in the last ten years.

 

And increasing efficiency does mean less jobs. Or less pay for the same job.
A mixed bag when viewed in an overall view.
Of course as efficiency rises so does the stock market though.

You are absolutely right and of course our fearless leader as always is right.Everyone knows that ATM machines and airline kiosks are made by aliens on another planet and flown in.

Humans don't make these machines nor do they service them.There is absolutely no human involvement in these machines at all.No one designs them,tests them,builds them,installs therm,or maintains them,or repairs them.It's all done by magic.

At the end of the day whenever this President makes a dumb ass comment like this it just shows why we need to get this guy out of office.

Or course it is..

And you haven't been checking very well. Recently airports rolled out kiosk checkins that replace counter people. Try calling a bank or your cable company for service..you get an automated menu. In my industry off the top of my head I can come up with applications that have cost a good number of jobs:

TIDAL - Job scheduler. Trading applications and after hour processing are done through automation (replacing computer operators).
UTP - Universal Trading Platform - Trading is now done through automation through the use of "Matching Engines" (which replace brokers) and "Market Makers" which (replaces specialists).
PUPPET - Maintains Operating System Integrity (Replacing system administrators).
RUBY ON RAILS - Allows for rapid development of applications through the use of visio like interfaces ( replacing software coders ).
ABINITIO - Like ruby on rails but specifically for trading applications ( replacing coders ).

Add in most major corporations are provisioning more money for automation then they are for new hires. One of the major reasons for this..is they don't want to be responsible for health care.

Automation, in itself, is a very good thing. But technology should be something that enhances the human ability to be productive..not replace it.
 
 
Rise up and throw you shoes in the computers of the world!

"In a March paper for the Council on Foreign Relations, Nobel laureate economist Michael Spence and New York University researcher Sandile Hlatshwayo argue that Germanys success at building a booming manufacturing sector that constitutes almost twice the share of the economy that ours does is largely the result of  a broad agreement among business, labor and government  to keep wages competitive and high-value-added production at home. Leslie Gelb, former president of the Council on Foreign Relations, also attributes Germanys overwhelmingly positive trade balance and comparatively low unemployment rate (7 percent) to that tripartite system. David Leonhardt, the New York Times economics columnist, wrote last week that Germany owed its edge in global competitiveness to a range of policies that could not be more different than ours: limiting homeownership, improving education (including vocational and technical education) and keeping unions strong  which is why middle-class pay, he noted, has risen at roughly the same rate as top incomes.

I'm sorry but if you can't comprehend that new technology comes at a price without being told you don't belong in this conversation.
 
 
 
I will not use the self checkouts at stores because they do eliminate local jobs.
they do create jobs in Tiawan and China where the hardware is made though.

 

IMO I should get a discount for using a self check out because I'm doing all the work.

Automation..as this country has been using it..results in a very big net loss for labor.

Not recognizing that as a factor in the challenge to create jobs is a fool's errand.

What about all the anti groping machines (lemme see your boobs machines) at the airport that "are new"? Oops that's right they created jobs not replacing jobs. Need an mri? Oh I guess your doctor could just use his xray glasses. Wanna order something online from home? Naw go ahead and waste your time and gas running around town looking for it at the same price. Gonna hire an over priced computer tech to fix your computer or spend your saved money elsewhere and do it yourself with online software?

There are more jobs created by a lot of our advancements and for the most part they're good paying jobs. Like the guy operating the mri machine. Course I guess he could be mowing my lawn.

 Companies Accelerate Spending as U.S. Productivity Bypasses Jobs - Bloomberg 

Excerpt:

Machines have the upper hand, Dutta said in a telephone interview from New York. You see this huge pickup in capital spending, but there isnt a meaningful increase in employment; its being grudgingly pulled along. The consumer is not going to perform the way people expect.

Unprecedented Gap

Even though employment tends to lag behind investment early in recoveries, BofAs Dutta said the current gap is unprecedented in the postwar era: Capital expenditures are expanding at an almost 14 percent pace, while job growth stays below zero, according to calculations he based on a six-quarter annualized change from the ends of the recessions.

In addition, the unintended consequences of policy changes indicate the government may undercut its own principal aim of job creation, he said.

I will not use the self checkouts at stores because they do eliminate local jobs.
they do create jobs in Tiawan and China where the hardware is made though.

 

IMO I should get a discount for using a self check out because I'm doing all the work.

 

SAN DIEGO  Public officials and faith leaders in San Diego are urging the governor to sign a measure that would ban alcohol sales at self-service checkout counters. A recent test of local retailers shows the current system isn't foolproof [...]

"It was pretty easy," Gamez says. "I grabbed a 12-pack of beer, and a 12-pack of Coke. I scanned the Coke, bagged the beer, paid the money, walked out. As simple as that."

That technique worked nearly seven out of ten times.

Too bad I'm not under 21 anymore because I would definitely have been using that trick.
 
 
 
 
 
That is not the reason we have high unemployment. Nor is it a contributing factor.

Now you guys can't have it both ways. Your all high on green or high tech energy. Don't you think that's gonna cost jobs as well as drive costs up because as we all know new tech always has a high price.

 

Ah, yes....the ol' " Everybody knows...." -pitch, much like John Boner & Eric Cantor insisting " The American people want...", or " The American people say...", or (even) " The American people know...".

It's simply a bullshit tactic to convince people (who don't agree with you ) that they're outta-step with " The American people " / " Everybody " -else.

 

Our employment-problems are a direct-result o' old-guard business - managers, who still manage to bullshit everyone into believing they (and, they alone ) possess all the knowledge, needed, to steer their companies towards prosperity....as-long-as those mega- bonu $ e $ keep comin'.

 

 
June 15, 2011

"In a March paper for the Council on Foreign Relations, Nobel laureate economist Michael Spence and New York University researcher Sandile Hlatshwayo argue that Germanys success at building a booming manufacturing sector that constitutes almost twice the share of the economy that ours does is largely the result of  a broad agreement among business, labor and government  to keep wages competitive and high-value-added production at home. Leslie Gelb, former president of the Council on Foreign Relations, also attributes Germanys overwhelmingly positive trade balance and comparatively low unemployment rate (7 percent) to that tripartite system. David Leonhardt, the New York Times economics columnist, wrote last week that Germany owed its edge in global competitiveness to a range of policies that could not be more different than ours: limiting homeownership, improving education (including vocational and technical education) and keeping unions strong  which is why middle-class pay, he noted, has risen at roughly the same rate as top incomes.

 Using German Ingenuity 

 

 

I'm sorry but if you can't comprehend that new technology comes at a price without being told you don't belong in this conversation.

So, what.....restructuring (from the oldy / moldy management-styles) is too- expensive to consider???

It doesn't matter whether you're talking hardware, software OR process....we've painted ourselves into an economic - corner, by refusing to discard the old, patriarchal-style of managing businesses....as Germany is proving !!!

This is remarkable given..

 
Are you kidding? Look at all the jobs the machines create: invent, production, program with updates, maintain, market & sell, fill. Look at the money in production time they save us. All versus the 1 teller they "may" replace.
It's just sad that our president is so eager to excuse away his own inept policies that his excuse is just as pathetic as the results of his policies.

 

Automation..as this country has been using it..results in a very big net loss for labor.

Not recognizing that as a factor in the challenge to create jobs is a fool's errand.

(So by the way is trying to have a meaningful discussion with Mr. Shaman. I suspect he's a bot)

 

That was my point. The person I was talking to denied that it was a given.

On topic though I'm not stupid I know jobs are lost to innovation. But often times better paying jobs are created in the process. This has been the norm in this country since the industrial revolution. To pin blame for unemployment on this issue is like watching amatuer hour at a comedy club.
Why is it Obama can never do wrong? That alone is as absurd as his position on this topic was. Were it GWB you guys would call him a laughing stock.

I'm on my phone so I can't highlight your post but at least you got it partially right.

Wages overseas are costing us jobs. But don't forget part of the reason for that "organized labor here" as well as high corporate taxes. But by all means ignore that and blame it on automation.
 
 
Nobody is blaming ALL of our job loss issues on automation, but it is a contributing factor.

As I've stated several times. Of course its part of it as it has been since the early 1900's. But when confronted with the question about our economy "THIS" is Obama's answer? How many of the unemployed lost their jobs in this downturn to this issue? Is there a machine that now sells cars, houses, remodeling services, heavy construction, teaching, police, etc....
Give me a break.

That might mean a re-tooling of skill sets for many..which means..financing proper education programs to do that.

Conservatives are dead set against that. One of the issues holding up trade agreements with South Korea is a provision to re-train workers displaced by the pact. Who's against that? Conservatives in Congress..of course. They want the agreement without that provision.

It's no wonder that conservatives are pooh-poohing this issue.

Winston Churchill was wrong, the best argument against democracy is not a five minute conversation with an average voter, in America it is a one minute conversation with a Palin book reader. That was sad, but perfectly summed up the level of knowledge and sense in our country. I give the interviewer great credit for his even handed questions.

Naw.

"Shovel-Ready" means building things. You know..like America USED to do.

For conservatives "Shovel-Ready" means blocking things...like if a bridge is about to collapse in your state..and it needs repair..a Conservative govenor goes "What Bridge"..till it falls down. Then he says "We had no way of knowing".

So when conservatives pat themselves on the back for morons like Christie when he blocks construction of a new tunnel from Jersey to Manhattan.

Or when Governor Rick Scott refuses high speed rail projects.

It's appalling when they are the first to ask "Where are the jobs?"

As in "Oh, the jobs you continue to block?"

Many on the "left" has some pretty serious disagreements with President Obama.

The problem is the "right" puts up this fantasy image of a Kenyan, Marxist, Socialist, Fascist, Hitler-like, Death Panel creating guy that looks like the Joker and expects to be taken seriously.

Try reading Paul Krugman every so often. He's very critical of Barack Obama's economic policies.

The President is full of shit! Obama is still trying to scapegoat his failure.

The plow & horse did not create permanent unemployment for farmers with hoes. The Steam Shovel did not do the same to ditch diggers & miners. There have been countless innovations throughout history that replace human labor. New jobs are always created by the advancements in lifestyles that outpaced the ones lost by labor replacing machine. If anything we have to many overeducated government dependent sissy's & to few blue collar workers to build oil pipelines & oil rigs, or operate drilling & mining equipment.

The only thing this country lacks is leadership.

 

The plow & horse did not create permanent unemployment for farmers with hoes

thats because the farmer usually did the work himself.....the the plow and horse just made his job easier.....same with the Tractor......but some machines have replaced people were there used to be hundreds working that job.....now there are just those feeding the machine and maintaining it....

The only thing this country lacks is leadership

i have been saying this quite often....

On the off chance that one or two of you might actually care about the facts, here's a factual objective assessment of the current reality:

 Companies Accelerate Spending as U.S. Productivity Bypasses Jobs - Bloomberg 

Excerpt:

“Machines have the upper hand,” Dutta said in a telephone interview from New York. “You see this huge pickup in capital spending, but there isn’t a meaningful increase in employment; it’s being grudgingly pulled along. The consumer is not going to perform the way people expect.”

‘Unprecedented’ Gap

Even though employment tends to lag behind investment early in recoveries, BofA’s Dutta said the current gap is “unprecedented” in the postwar era: Capital expenditures are expanding at an almost 14 percent pace, while job growth stays below zero, according to calculations he based on a six-quarter annualized change from the ends of the recessions.

In addition, the “unintended consequences” of policy changes indicate the government may “undercut its own principal aim of job creation,” he said.

While the tax bill President Barack Obama signed Dec. 17 allows businesses to write off 100 percent of some purchases in 2011, there’s no similar incentive to speed up hiring. The Fed’s commitment to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero for an extended period also facilitates lower-cost financing for machines.

 

And who is it that's going to maintain all these extra machines being bought?

...Which makes it the perfect Porky Limbaugh created "talking-point".

 
Limbaugh : Obama "Cited ATM Machines As A Reason For High Unemployment."

During his June 14 radio program, Rush Limbaugh said:

"There's a new reason for high unemployment as told by Obama. He had that interview with Ann Curry at the Today Show, and basically there's too much automation out there. He cited ATM machines as a reason for high unemployment. No, no. I kid you not. That's right! Obama explained to NBC News the reason that companies are not hiring is not because of his policies, it's because the economy is so automated. He said, "There are some structural issues with our economy where a lot of businesses have learned to become much more efficient with a lot fewer workers. You see it when you go to a bank and you use an ATM; you don't go to a bank teller -- or you go to the airport and you're using a kiosk instead of checking in at the gate."

"We've lost two million jobs since the stimulus, and now today or yesterday we learned it's because of "automation." That's what he told Ann Curry. [Premiere Radio Networks, The Rush Limbaugh Show, 6/14/11]

 Another Helping o' Pigshit, For Teabaggers 

 

 
 
 
It would be easier to read your posts if you took off all that ridiculous flamboyant bs.
 
 
 
 
 
We Americans have been well trained to be satisfied with less service.

 

Yes, People choose price over service. It is hard to believe the "Full Service Gas Station Attendant" was one of the first customer service jobs I saw go away. I say bring them back.

 

 

The price of gas and you want personalized service at the pump?
Are you just lazy or nuts?

 

I just want someone to air up my tires & wash my windows. Obama says if we air up our tires it will save us gas so that should cover the extra cost.  

It could be one of those new "Green Jobs".
 
 
 
The President is not wrong. In just two years I've seen automation reduce the personnel size in my office by 30%.

 

In the two years did your company grow? Did your company see an increase revenue of any kind?
 
 
Obama is lucky is he holds even 2 of the 57 states he claims to have visited in 2008.

The only politician stupider is Joe Biden
 
 
Obama blames ATM for high unemployment and then thinks people are too stupid to understand this.

All this subject proves is that the Republicans wouldn't have any better luck creating jobs even if you put them back in power.

There's not a single aspect of the GOP economic agenda that is going to overcome this reality of the shrinking pool of labor intensive businesses in the US.
 
 
Actually, what this thread proves is that the left is mired in the past and doesn't have a clue about the dynamics of labor markets, innovation and technology. Labor needs change rapidly in today's world, fueled by the acceleration of technology advances.

Hell, in my field, which for the last decade or so has been almost exclusively devoted to accounting software and such, is now rapidly changing to total ERP solutions, etc. You adapt. I spend significantly more time these days learning new technology.. it's just the way it is.

So?
In order to not become one the replaced, you improve your value to the company by increasing your skill set.

 

Yes, but mathematically not everyone can be chosen. Not that difficult to grasp.

Yea because as we all know if we lowered our corporate tax rate to compete with the rest of the world or removed some of the anti business regulations or make our nation a right to work nation that none of our jobs might come back. Hell even the burdens that unions put on our companies if relaxed could increase employment for everyone instead of just a select few.

I own a small remodeling business and when I've worked on large commercial jobs I've been picketed. Like someone else deserves the job more than me.

And you think lower corporate taxes and eliminating 'Anti-business regulation' would alleviate this because... Why?  

The truth is that with zero tax and laissez faire regulation, companies are still going to go where the labor's cheap. The only thing that will bring that sort of job back is to make it less profitable to outsource labor; Tariffs or direct regulation, and unfortunately there is no political will to do either.

Are you kidding? Look at all the jobs the machines create: invent, production, program with updates, maintain, market & sell, fill. Look at the money in production time they save us. All versus the 1 teller they "may" replace.
It's just sad that our president is so eager to excuse away his own inept policies that his excuse is just as pathetic as the results of his policies.

 

Look, I'm no fan of Obama, but technology and automation can and does reduce jobs. Of course, it has also opened up other industries and jobs too. A for instance comes from a show I saw last night on the History Channel called 101 Gadgets that Changed the World. One of the items was the sewing machine. Before the invention of the sewing machine, it took 14 hours for a tailor to sew a shirt. With the sewing machine, it took 1 hour. A tailor could produce 14 shirts in the time it used to take him to make 1. That sounds great because the tailor can now produce 14 times as much as he could before in the same amount of time.......but all tailors producing 14 times as much as they used to creates a surplus shirts and drives the price down so far they can't make a living. Many tailors went in search of other jobs as they could no longer make enough money being a tailor.

I've worked in the banking industry for over 30 years. I was around when ATM's were first on the scene and actually dealt with them early in my career. The ATM did in fact reduce the number of tellers a bank needed. You have machine that works 24/7, doesn't eat, sleep, get sich or require a benefits package. An ATM was cheaper in the long run than a human employee and didn't make mistakes.
 
 
Come to think of it I remember the bank tellers that were replaced by atms at:

Strip bars
Airports
Grocery stores
Malls
Random street corners
Casinos
Convience stores
Drug store
Places of employment
Places of education
Amusement parks
Train stations
Cafeterias
24 hour banks lol

You get my point. Far more jobs have been created by all these machines than the ones lost period.
Stop being ideologues and face the facts.
 
 
The Cotton Gin put 3.1 million out of work.

 
 
 
 

They're destroying the US economy!!
 
 
Not to forget all the money that is spent after banking hours because of atms. And the jobs and revenue thereby created that could have been lost.
 
 
There is validity to this.

Research departments of dozens are replaced with one person who knows how to perform boolean searches on the internet.

A team of switchboard operators are replaced by voice mail and only one receptionist for overflow

One secretary per executive is replaced by one secretary per 3 or 4 executives with advanced WP and graphics programs

A mailroom of multiple clerks is replaced by one or two mailroom people with the increase use of e-mail

Now...they may not sound like a lot of people...but when you spread it over tens of thousands of companies...it adds up.

With concern of head count...cost of insuring headcount......increase in employment regulations.....companies have been spending more money on new technology to accomodate growth as opposed to increasing the payroll

All of that has NOTHING to do with the recent spike in unemployment. All the semantic arguments in the world don't change anything. What Obama doesn't understand is that booksmarts =/= common sense, and sometimes that's all you need.

The recent spike?
No...that is a result of fear tactics used during the 2008 campaign and the subsequent villifying by the new administration of the job creators....coupled with the threat of cap and trade, an increase in healthcare costs to the employer, and threat of more regulations.

The recession was just a recession.....unemployment would have levelled out at around 7 or 8 percent...we would have had no growth for a year to a year and a half...and we would have recovered.....sort of like we always do.

Sadly...one of the candidates looked to capitalize on the recession.....scare the shit out of everyone...and then tell them "vote for me and I will send a check to 95% of you at a time when the economy will be in a near depression." (PARAPHRASED FOR AFFECT)

And it worked...he made the economy worse..and he won the election.

Thus why I see him as an asshole.

What I laid out earlier was why we have had prosperous times without a dramatic increase in employment percentage

Interestingly, as I see it (I am a business planner and human resource solutions consultant in NYC).....

in the last decade (2000-2007)....despite an increase in population, an increase in the retirement age, and an increase in major technoology (as I laid out earlier)....there was NOT an increase in unemployment except during times of recession (market saturation caused as is usually the norm)..

So when the pundits talk about how few jobs were created during the Bush years...they are either niave or disingenuous....

Truth is....people did quite well during those years...and unemployment was quite stable....and all of the negative ingredients were there for increased unemployment...

and by the way....recall Obamas one liner...

"are you better now than youy were 8 years ago".....he had the gall to ask that during a recession...if he had asked that question a year earlier...most would have said "hell yeah, Im a lot better off"

But he asked it during a recession when people are ALWAYS concerned....

He fooled the masses....and he still fools many of them.

The man is an asshole.

Enough said.

I also run a small business. Have for over 20 years. The downturn started affecting me at the end of June and it hasn't picked back up yet. Oddly enough I timed my losses to about the same time Obama became the nominee. Makes me think that along with all the other issues the prospect of him as president caused even more fear.

Many of us saw right through him. We saw that he had the charisma and speech writers...but nothing behind him in terms of experience and substance....and yes...ut scared us as we knew he would "try things" at the cost of capitalsim.

And then the "police acted stupidly" thing
and the "pediatricians take out tonsils for profit" thing

And we realized we had a real amateur in a very high position....

Scared me enough to back down and wait a few years before I did ANYTHING major with my estate and my business.
 
 
Blaming Bush no longer working now he's blaming machinery for all his mistakes and failures !!!! This presidency is the worst in the history of America!!!!
 
 
If he really thinks this is true,he is one dumb sucker.
 
 
 
I saw a story on this in the news earlier today. The president's point was absolutely correct.

 

So we should get rid of ATM's. E-Z Pass, self checkouts, self serve gasoline, back hoes bulldozers and everything else that increases efficiency and reduces costs....
You people are idiots.
 
 
The President is a pretty smart guy. Yes he is and don't you forget it. Sarah Palin is stupid. Yes she is and don't you forget it. If you do, then you're a racist, bigot, homophobe poopy pants.

Democrats like to make shit up as this position proves. This so called problem is decades old and the solution was found decades ago as well. It's called higher education, self reliance, adaptation, changing with the times. Of course if you weren't smart enough to use one of these time tested solutions then you got no one to blame but your fictional nemesis.
Or you could just take some more Obama candy (partisanship with a side of welfare handouts)
I never understand how you all ever came to the conclusion that its the govts job to fix your lives. Youda been screwed if you were born a hundred years ago.
Self reliance FTW

I don't think anyone is buying what you're selling. Dems have controlled congress since 2007. You all had two years without any resistance to do whatever you wanted. That's your fault.
 
 
 
 
 
How many humans have been replaced by sutomated Telephone systems.
Press 1 for the pharmacy, press 2 for lumber, press 3 to hear a duck quack, etc.

 

None. The menu just helps route calls to the correct person.
How many people have been replaced by robots on auto assembly lines?
How many ditch diggers haver been replaced by backhoes, pay loaders and bulldozers?
How many people have been replaced by automatic irrigation systems on golf courses or sod farms?
Please. With his words from yesterday, Obama just confirmed how out of touch he actually is.

 

That's completely and utterly incorrect.

 

It is so correct.
Blaming ATM's for unemployment? Is he fucking kidding?
The fact of the matter is with those comments Obama is catering to the union vote.
When Obama talks about jobs, he is referring to private and public sector union jobs.
He doesn't necessarily want to increase their numbers, he just wants their votes.
 
 
 
The Cotton Gin put 3.1 million out of work.

 

 

I don't think the slaves minded not combing cotton.
 
 
 
 
In part, he's right.

And this trend where techology makes human workers reducdant is NOT going away, either.

15 years ago I had 6 part time workers and myself working on Rosetta.

Those people worked on scanning and cleaning images, plus one "engineer" whose sole job was to help us get and stay online

Collectively they put in about 80 hours a week.

Now what they did, I and an engineer I have on retainer do all that work PLUS much more, too in about 20 hours a week.

I'd guesstimate that in my little project we have enjoyed about a 500% increase in efficiency in the last ten years.

 

And increasing efficiency does mean less jobs. Or less pay for the same job.
A mixed bag when viewed in an overall view.
Of course as efficiency rises so does the stock market though.

 

Yet, despite the fact that we have more automation than when Roosevelt was president, along with more efficiency and more productive workers, we also have more working than we did then. How do you reconcile your belief that automation means fewer jobs with the massive increase in jobs?
 
 
 
 
I'm sorry but if you can't comprehend that new technology comes at a price without being told you don't belong in this conversation.

 

This is remarkable given..

 
Are you kidding? Look at all the jobs the machines create: invent, production, program with updates, maintain, market & sell, fill. Look at the money in production time they save us. All versus the 1 teller they "may" replace.
It's just sad that our president is so eager to excuse away his own inept policies that his excuse is just as pathetic as the results of his policies.

 

Automation..as this country has been using it..results in a very big net loss for labor.

Not recognizing that as a factor in the challenge to create jobs is a fool's errand.

(So by the way is trying to have a meaningful discussion with Mr. Shaman. I suspect he's a bot)

 

The world's industrial and manufacturing leaders have been automating plants for 2 decades. This while American manufacturers stayed cow towed to the unions which prevented increases in productivity and accountability in product quality.
Your side wants a return to the old smoke stack plants which require inefficiency and over employment.
Us Industry needs to move forward. Automation, computers and robotics are the way to go.
 
 
Hmmmm.. not sure what to think. I can't stand Obama's policies and 99% of what he stands for. But on this matter, I wonder if there could be some truth in it in some circumstances? Yes, I realize this is UK (below link), but I'm sure USA will see it soon? Or just tell me if I'm thinking wrong, lol.

It's not even remotely related to the problem. These evil machines have been around for decades. Last time I checked they weren't recently invented to replace anyone. It's just reaching. It's a ridiculous distraction that the main steam media didn't even have the balls to call him on. I defy you to tell me the media isn't in his pocket after all the years of calling GWB stupid.

 

Or course it is..

And you haven't been checking very well. Recently airports rolled out kiosk checkins that replace counter people. Try calling a bank or your cable company for service..you get an automated menu. In my industry off the top of my head I can come up with applications that have cost a good number of jobs:

TIDAL - Job scheduler. Trading applications and after hour processing are done through automation (replacing computer operators).
UTP - Universal Trading Platform - Trading is now done through automation through the use of "Matching Engines" (which replace brokers) and "Market Makers" which (replaces specialists).
PUPPET - Maintains Operating System Integrity (Replacing system administrators).
RUBY ON RAILS - Allows for rapid development of applications through the use of visio like interfaces ( replacing software coders ).
ABINITIO - Like ruby on rails but specifically for trading applications ( replacing coders ).

Add in most major corporations are provisioning more money for automation then they are for new hires. One of the major reasons for this..is they don't want to be responsible for health care.

Automation, in itself, is a very good thing. But technology should be something that enhances the human ability to be productive..not replace it.

 

It does.

Those ticket kiosks allow people who would normally be stuck in dead end jobs processing tickets that have already been paid for to be offered more opportunity to work in other areas. The fact that companies do not have to keep hundreds of people sitting around doing nothing but answer phones keeps healthcare costs down by putting them into jobs where they can get up and move around more. They also get a chance to get more pay and better benefits.

Every supposed negative you can name I can counter with a positive from it, both for the person negatively affected and the country in general. I really believe you are not stupid enough to want us to go back to the point where half of the workforce was labor on farms, and half of the rest was digging ditches. Why are you crying about the modernization of the workforce moving us into the future?
 
 
 
 
 
I will not use the self checkouts at stores because they do eliminate local jobs.
they do create jobs in Tiawan and China where the hardware is made though.

 

IMO I should get a discount for using a self check out because I'm doing all the work.

 

SAN DIEGO  Public officials and faith leaders in San Diego are urging the governor to sign a measure that would ban alcohol sales at self-service checkout counters. A recent test of local retailers shows the current system isn't foolproof [...]

"It was pretty easy," Gamez says. "I grabbed a 12-pack of beer, and a 12-pack of Coke. I scanned the Coke, bagged the beer, paid the money, walked out. As simple as that."

That technique worked nearly seven out of ten times.

 Self-Service Checkout Counters: Too Easy For Kids To Buy Booze 

 

That's bullshit. Note how the kid said he didn't scan the beer. He stole it. He's a fucking criminal that deserves to be imprisoned at hard labor.
Every single store around here that has self checkout will not permit the sale of alcohol without a clerk seeing ID and then entering a code to allow the purchase. It's NC state law that if a person appears to be under 40 years of age the store personnel MUST see a photo ID. It is also state law that in stores where alcohol sales are permitted, a store employee MUST be present to monitor merchandise going through the self checkouts.
 
 
 
I watched a bit of the first youtube and I just had to laugh, it is sad that our young people are this dumb and actually argue for their stupidity? Did this person think history started the day he was born? Since I have started working the change in technology is simply amazing, communication sites that used to employ as many as fifty people round the clock 24 by 7 are now manged remotely, and may get a visitor only if a hardware component needs actual changing. Add automation to outsourcing and you can readily see the power of the machine and the network is a machine. Who could have conceived of networks that allows an Asia Indian the ability to access your PC and fix it. Americans do not even support Americans by buying American today, and wages overseas are killing jobs here. Americans, especially on the right, do one thing machines don't do, they whine and whine and whine and do nothing else.

"A new barbarism, illiteracy and impoverishment of language, new kinds of poverty, merciless remodeling of opinion by media, immiseration of the mind, obsolescence of the soul. Massified, standardizing modes, in every area of life, relentlessly re-enact the actual control program of modernity. Capitalism did not create our world; the machine did." Jean-François Lyotard

 

This is bad because you say so?

Question regarding your post...

An airline has 100 non flight personnel working for them...say 25 counter people....25 customer service people in the office making reservations.....50 luggage handlers.

Andf they cater to 1000 passengers a month

They institute the kisks and the auotmated phone system to take reservations....eliminating 20 of the 25 counter people and 20 of the 25 customer service people.

They still cater to the same 1000 passengers a month.

Where do they reposition those 40 employees that were replaced with technology?
 
 
Of course, none of these machines that eliminate jobs existed until Obama became president........
 
 
 
 
We Americans have been well trained to be satisfied with less service.

 

Yes, People choose price over service. It is hard to believe the "Full Service Gas Station Attendant" was one of the first customer service jobs I saw go away. I say bring them back.

 

 

Go to New Jersey. That state prohibits self service gas. Drivers have to wait while some grumpy asshole who hates his job and despises the customers to take his sweet time making his way to the waiting motorists.
The state may require attendants to pump gas,but there is no requirement to perform customer service....And here's the best part. These low skilled shit heads look at the customer cross eyed because they didn't get a tip...Fuck 'em.
 
 
 
 
 
But I just woke up?!

 

Not quite.....

For TOO long, people have insisted there'll always be a conflict between business, government & labor; that they CAN ' T work-together, successfully!

Germany's PROVING otherwise!!

 

I'm sorry but I have no idea what your post has to do with obamas statement. I don't care about what they are doing in Germany. And we don't need govt and business working together, we need govt to get the hell out of our business.

 

You should really stop trying to be rational with Shaman, he is off his meds.
 
 
 
Of course, none of these machines that eliminate jobs existed until Obama became president........

 

lol...question is why technology was not the reason there was a dramatic increase of jobs during the Bush years.....

Funny how it had no affect from 2000-2008.....only an affect from 2008 to now..

Even though MOST of the technology was insituted in the early 2000's like voice mail...boolean searches....kiosks....etc etc etc..

Where is the media when Obama and his team says such rediculous things?

Winston Churchill was wrong, the best argument against democracy is not a five minute conversation with an average voter, in America it is a one minute conversation with a Palin book reader. That was sad, but perfectly summed up the level of knowledge and sense in our country. I give the interviewer great credit for his even handed questions. He could have asked a real trick question, did they read any newspapers. And the study that Fox media has made America dumber is confirmed once again.

 

what the fuck does this shit have to do with anything.
Stay on point or start your own thread.

Your problem here is you are looking at only one company, not the economy as a whole. Those 40 people might end up working for the company that took their jobs as they expand to fill the demand for more equipment to make companies more efficient. Unions oppose automation because they only think of themselves, not the whole country.

Nothing wrong with that, that is what they are supposed to do. Obama, as president, is supposed to have the opposite view. He should support policies that support economic growth for the whole country, even if they do immediate harm to someone who might vote for him.
 
 
 
 
Hope and change and...excuses, excuses, excuses.

Gee, if only the shovel companies had ramped up production the stimulus would have worked!

 

Naw.

"Shovel-Ready" means building things. You know..like America USED to do.

For conservatives "Shovel-Ready" means blocking things...like if a bridge is about to collapse in your state..and it needs repair..a Conservative govenor goes "What Bridge"..till it falls down. Then he says "We had no way of knowing".

So when conservatives pat themselves on the back for morons like Christie when he blocks construction of a new tunnel from Jersey to Manhattan.

Or when Governor Rick Scott refuses high speed rail projects.

It's appalling when they are the first to ask "Where are the jobs?"

As in "Oh, the jobs you continue to block?"

 

BY "shovel ready" Obama was referring to publicly funded make work projects. Such as building roads. Great idea, but there was no funding from the states and there was no way the rights of way could be purchased( state or local money not in place). Nor were federal environmental impact studies to be fast tracked to start the projects. The Army Corps of Engineers does their studies at their pace. This also was never considered by President "Shovel Ready"..
The fact is there were never any shovel ready projects anywhere in the US.
The stimulus money was a slush fund for the President's use to spend on public worker union jobs.
 
 
Obama fed us all a pile of BS about shovel-ready jobs and his supporters swallowed it like the rest of the BS he dished out.

I think you are the one that is ignoring reality here.

Companies were forced to lay off workers as a result of the economic downturn. They then saw an influx of cash and, instead of going back to the old way of doing business, adopted new technology and innovated the way they do business. This has caused a disruption in the number of jobs those companies have, but it will also cause an increase in demand for new equipment, which will result in new jobs at other companies as they ramp up to meet the demand. Pointing to one factor in all of this and trying to fix that is stupid, because the overall result is good for everyone.
 
 
 
Its amazing how liberals continue to vilify technology. If these nutjobs had their way we'd be living in tents without electricity. They don't want nuclear energy, coal energy, oil energy....and now not even automation which make higher quality products, because 'hey that was once a union job!'

 

It's amazing how Conservatives can see all this shit happening around them and then blame the people that are the casualties of this phenomena "lazy deadbeats" because they can't find a family sustaining job like they USED to have before they were replaced.

So tell me brilliant.... what happens when fully automated facilities happen? Artificial intelligence and robotics are getting to that point rather quickly. "lights out" manufacturing is in the very near future.

So I guess all the unemployed that result in that breakthrough will be deadbeats too. We are already at the point where there are very few jobs for everyday people other than menial crap. Sooner or later, it's going to have to get to the point where people have to come before profits in some way.

I dunno, say... get retained for a new job? Adapt? Start your own business? Re-evaluate your choice in trade? Get more education? Regret not preparing for your future?

Or you could get on welfare and wait for the govt to fix your life for you?

Again ill ask. What makes you feel that the govt owes any of us anything. If everyone had your opinions at the founding of our country through the next hundred years we might very well be living under a different flag. But because we were a nation that could adapt and not wait for hand outs we still have our banner.

The amount of utter laziness that I've witnessed growing on this country in my short life tells me we are headed down a road with no good uturn spots.

This is the problem of conservatism in general. It caters to the elite and shits on everyone else.

Two real world examples off the top of my head:

My ex-wife was an institutional investor. She did write ups and various companies, sometimes having to visit the site. One such place was a condom company in the south. They were moving operations overseas. She interviewed the employees and not one knew what was about to happen. Several hundred people lost their jobs in one day.

Another was guy I heard about was a COBOL programmer. He programmed an application that tracked OTC bond trading and he was expected to do 24 by 7 support for it. This left him little time to do anything else. The company was upgrading the application and didn't tell him..fearing he would leave before they cutover. He had worked long and hard for them for some 20 or so years..and needed a couple of more years before he could retire. Well they cut over the application and fired the guy. At the age of 52 he was left without a job..benefits...no pension until 65..and very few shops were using COBOL.

This is the way the conservative world works.

And this is the perfect example of why privatizing benefits or the choice to do so is essential. He could have used equity in "his" benefits to retrain instead of waiting for uncle sams rules to kick in.

They've been screwing you all along. It's too bad you only just found out.
Myself, I've had my ears open for decades and have heard all the warnings about our useless safety net. And you are partially right. We don't need a govt in our personal lives. The purpose of our govt is supposed to be for protection from hostile entities not to baby sit us and allow us to succel at her teet.

As things become more and more automated... there will be less and less jobs to get "retrained" for.

What flag would that be? Ohhh... you must mean the Chinese Flag, right? Don't blame Government on that one.... well.... I guess the people that made the legislation for it to happen could be blamed... but moreso blame the mass exodus of the manufacturing jobs on the companies that did it with gusto.

The amount of laziness? Gimme a break. How old are you sunshine? What laziness do you speak of? I see people frustrated and lost. I see people every damned day when I go to work who sit behind the counter of a Convenience store trying to make a damned living doing a job that a high school kid should be doing. I see greeters at Walmart that should be retired, but have had their retirement savings squandered by Wall Street Casinos.

You have no clue of what you speak. You want to make everyone out to be a Crackhead from the ghetto, when the truth is far, far from that. It's called "DEHUMANIZING" it's a war tactic... look it up.

I guess the people that made the legislation for it to happen could be blamed... but moreso blame the mass exodus of the manufacturing jobs on the companies that did it with gusto.

The amount of laziness? Gimme a break. How old are you sunshine? What laziness do you speak of? I see people frustrated and lost. I see people every damned day when I go to work who sit behind the counter of a Convenience store trying to make a damned living doing a job that a high school kid should be doing. I see greeters at Walmart that should be retired, but have had their retirement savings squandered by Wall Street Casinos.

You have no clue of what you speak. You want to make everyone out to be a Crackhead from the ghetto, when the truth is far, far from that. It's called "DEHUMANIZING" it's a war tactic... look it up.

 

I have no clue? Let me give you a clue!

At 16 years old I was certified as an adult and sent to prison. I did 3 years in a penitentiary built in the 1800's. While in prison I got my ged and nothing more. I married my girlfriend in my last year despite the fact that she was pregnant by another. When I got out I got my own student loans and went to college.
About a year later your precious uncle Sam sued me for all the aid they had given my wife during my last year in prison. They said pay or we will find the real father and make him pay (obviously bringing him into the picture when he wasn't wanted) Did I cry? No, I paid.
By now I have 2 children, I'm in school my wife is in school and were working days & nights.
Jobs are definitely harder for me to find then, than they are for anyone now because of my past. Yet we managed.
The trade school she was in went belly up and ultimately we had to continue paying her tuition fees. I dropped out of DeVry and bought an old highway patrol car. Painted it yellow and paid checker a 495 weekly franchise fee to use their dispatch and name. While driving I got an education in home building and blueprints. After finishing that school I sold my cab and used that money to buy the basic tools needed to start a remodeling company.
The first business failed within 2 years because I was ill prepared for the financial side of it. I muddled around for about a year doing your so called bs jobs until I could muster enough drive to try again. That was 20+ years ago. I have done a lot of HUD work in the last 10 years and have seen FIRST hand how the system is abused. Some projects I was even required to hire from within the community I was working in and pay them ridiculous prevailing wages. Like 17 dollars an hour just to push a broom.
I am now an award winning contractor who has been on the cover of industry magazines and have won awards from Angieslist for 6 of the last 7 years.

So in my opinion I have a very large clue about employment and how the govt and people alike abuse the system. In short if a scumbag like I used to be can go against all the odds to become a success story then I have no sympathy for those who havnt had near the hurdles I have.

Self reliance.
 
 
 
 
 
This is remarkable given..

Automation..as this country has been using it..results in a very big net loss for labor.

Not recognizing that as a factor in the challenge to create jobs is a fool's errand.

(So by the way is trying to have a meaningful discussion with Mr. Shaman. I suspect he's a bot)

 

That was my point. The person I was talking to denied that it was a given.

On topic though I'm not stupid I know jobs are lost to innovation. But often times better paying jobs are created in the process. This has been the norm in this country since the industrial revolution. To pin blame for unemployment on this issue is like watching amatuer hour at a comedy club.
Why is it Obama can never do wrong? That alone is as absurd as his position on this topic was. Were it GWB you guys would call him a laughing stock.
Are those rose tinted glasses expensive?

 

Are you kidding? I've posted threads about things I've thought Obama has gotten wrong, like extending the Bush tax cuts, our continued war in Afghanistan, and trying to include bat shit crazy republicans into policy.

For the first time in history..corporations are spending more on "machines" then they are on new hires. That shouldn't be concern? That shouldn't be addressed?

That might mean a re-tooling skill sets for many..which means..financing proper education programs to do that.

Conservatives are dead set against that. One of the issues holding up trade agreements with South Korea is a provision to re-train workers displaced by the pact. Who's against that? Conservatives in Congress..of course. They want the agreement without that provision.

It's no wonder that conservatives are pooh-poohing this issue.

 

All of those people that are making all of those machines that corporations are buying are employed.
 
 
 
 
 
It's amazing how Conservatives can see all this shit happening around them and then blame the people that are the casualties of this phenomena "lazy deadbeats" because they can't find a family sustaining job like they USED to have before they were replaced.

So tell me brilliant.... what happens when fully automated facilities happen? Artificial intelligence and robotics are getting to that point rather quickly. "lights out" manufacturing is in the very near future.

So I guess all the unemployed that result in that breakthrough will be deadbeats too. We are already at the point where there are very few jobs for everyday people other than menial crap. Sooner or later, it's going to have to get to the point where people have to come before profits in some way.

 

This is the problem of conservatism in general. It caters to the elite and shits on everyone else.

Two real world examples off the top of my head:

My ex-wife was an institutional investor. She did write ups and various companies, sometimes having to visit the site. One such place was a condom company in the south. They were moving operations overseas. She interviewed the employees and not one knew what was about to happen. Several hundred people lost their jobs in one day.

Another was guy I heard about was a COBOL programmer. He programmed an application that tracked OTC bond trading and he was expected to do 24 by 7 support for it. This left him little time to do anything else. The company was upgrading the application and didn't tell him..fearing he would leave before they cutover. He had worked long and hard for them for some 20 or so years..and needed a couple of more years before he could retire. Well they cut over the application and fired the guy. At the age of 52 he was left without a job..benefits...no pension until 65..and very few shops were using COBOL.

This is the way the conservative world works.

 

And this is the perfect example of why privatizing benefits or the choice to do so is essential. He could have used equity in "his" benefits to retrain instead of waiting for uncle sams rules to kick in.

Self reliance

 

You do have privatized benefits. What exactly are you talking about? You don't know about IRAs? 401ks?

How old are you?

Have you ever held a job?

Seriously.

All of those people that are making all of those machines that corporations are buying are employed.

 

And?

If you got three people making one machine that gets rid of 80 jobs..well you think that's a good thing?

Or do you think we as a people should be doing something to mitigate the impact of such a move.

Like retraining the 80 people?

Or..do just ignore the whole fucking thing and say it was those 80 people that are at fault for not continually going to school to upgrade their skills.

In other words..working 40 or more hours a week..and spending the rest in training.

Constantly.

Always.

Forever..until they die.

Do you really want an economy where no one is sure of long term employment?
 
 
Q: As a Machine, what is your reaction to being blamed by Obama for high unemployment?

So we should get rid of ATM's. E-Z Pass, self checkouts, self serve gasoline, back hoes bulldozers and everything else that increases efficiency and reduces costs....
You people are idiots.

 

i dont see anyone here saying that.....i see people saying that in certain industries Automation has reduced the amount of people working for said Industry....
 
 
 
When exactly was that suggested?

Recognizing a problem is the first step in solving it.

Which is why conservatives can never solve problems.

But they have absolutely no trouble creating them.

 

come on Sallow.....have you been to California?.....a very Liberal State with Liberals in the majority who have played a big part in creating Cals problems as well as not coming up with a hell of a lot of plans to fix it....BECAUSE.....the words....STOP FUCKING SPENDING.....does not resonate out here to well....
 
 
I wasn't talking about ira's or the like. I was referring to entitlements. Because combining all your earnings would enable you more flexibility without the harsh cuts.

And why the lame attempts at insults mixed with superiority complex?

Question regarding your post...

An airline has 100 non flight personnel working for them...say 25 counter people....25 customer service people in the office making reservations.....50 luggage handlers.

Andf they cater to 1000 passengers a month

They institute the kisks and the auotmated phone system to take reservations....eliminating 20 of the 25 counter people and 20 of the 25 customer service people.

They still cater to the same 1000 passengers a month.

Where do they reposition those 40 employees that were replaced with technology?

 

Your problem here is you are looking at only one company, not the economy as a whole. Those 40 people might end up working for the company that took their jobs as they expand to fill the demand for more equipment to make companies more efficient. Unions oppose automation because they only think of themselves, not the whole country.

Nothing wrong with that, that is what they are supposed to do. Obama, as president, is supposed to have the opposite view. He should support policies that support economic growth for the whole country, even if they do immediate harm to someone who might vote for him.

 

This is laughable considering the unrelenting conservative assault on new technology in the field of energy.  

 

I suspect that older Americans on a fixed income don't have $42,000 for a new Chevrolet Volt. And younger Americans with 3 or 4 kids couldn't get the whole family in one.
 
 
 
Go to New Jersey. That state prohibits self service gas. Drivers have to wait while some grumpy asshole who hates his job and despises the customers to take his sweet time making his way to the waiting motorists.
The state may require attendants to pump gas,but there is no requirement to perform customer service....And here's the best part. These low skilled shit heads look at the customer cross eyed because they didn't get a tip...Fuck 'em.

 

are you serious?.....dam i would much rather pump my own gas......
 
 
 
 
 
Not quite.....

For TOO long, people have insisted there'll always be a conflict between business, government & labor; that they CAN ' T work-together, successfully!

Germany's PROVING otherwise!!

 

I'm sorry but I have no idea what your post has to do with obamas statement. I don't care about what they are doing in Germany. And we don't need govt and business working together, we need govt to get the hell out of our business.

 

You should really stop trying to be rational with Shaman, he is off his meds.

 

Meds?....the guy is a fucking Jerk.....him and that other Bombastic poster Skookers or something......should be told post normal or dont post at all....they think the Colors and giant Letters that they use has an effect on their posts......it does....just not the way they seem to think it does....

Either you keep up with the world or it passes you by.

The days of going to work digging ditches for the same company until you retire never did exist.

I am an Electrical Engineer and I assure you that I take refresher courses once or twice a year to keep abreast of the rapidly changing technology. And, I have changed companies 4 times, twice because the companies were not staying competitive, and eventually they were bought out by one that was.

How many humans have been replaced by sutomated Telephone systems.
Press 1 for the pharmacy, press 2 for lumber, press 3 to hear a duck quack, etc.

 

None. The menu just helps route calls to the correct person.
How many people have been replaced by robots on auto assembly lines?
How many ditch diggers haver been replaced by backhoes, pay loaders and bulldozers?
How many people have been replaced by automatic irrigation systems on golf courses or sod farms?
Please. With his words from yesterday, Obama just confirmed how out of touch he actually is.

 

Lots of people have been replaced by robots on automobile assembly lines, but you're right that those other professionals are still driven by humans. It's interesting that manual tasks which machines should excel at are some of the least automated sectors.

However, make no mistake, automation does destroy jobs. Fifty years ago, you'd go into business and every officer of the firm would have a secretary. Today, they share one, maybe two. Similar trends exist across the entire economy.

That being said, the President is wrong to focus on this. The lack of jobs isn't due to machines. It's due to weak demand.

Prop 13 was passed in 1978. The governor at the time was a Democrat, but he was preceded in office by eight years of Republican rule, and was followed by another 16. Except for 1964, the state had voted Republican in six straight presidential elections. Yeah, it's pretty hard to claim 1978 California was some liberal paradise.

It's a pretty liberal state to be sure.

But they are more "liberatarian" style Liberals then say..New Yorkers are..

Which are more Daniel Moynihan style Liberals.

My girlfriend, who is pretty liberal (she designs for a packaging company) is nutty over taxes. She's a 15% flat tax advocate. To me that's pure lunacy.

Yes, People choose price over service. It is hard to believe the "Full Service Gas Station Attendant" was one of the first customer service jobs I saw go away. I say bring them back.

The state may require attendants to pump gas,but there is no requirement to perform customer service....And here's the best part. These low skilled shit heads look at the customer cross eyed because they didn't get a tip...Fuck 'em.

 

This is the way it was in the USA until the 1970s. Oregon still has the same law also.

 

I am aware on point two and am old enough( started driving in 1977 in NJ) to remember one guy pumped gas while another cleaned the windshield and checked the oil.

Obama blamed ATM's..... The union representing New Jersey Turnpike Authority toll collectors protested the addition of more E-Z Pass lanes claiming the automated collections system took away jobs...Cry me a fucking river.If these people knew how to make change and processed more cars, there wouldn't be a need for E-Z Pass.
Automation? Where's the problem?

Or course it is..

And you haven't been checking very well. Recently airports rolled out kiosk checkins that replace counter people. Try calling a bank or your cable company for service..you get an automated menu. In my industry off the top of my head I can come up with applications that have cost a good number of jobs:

TIDAL - Job scheduler. Trading applications and after hour processing are done through automation (replacing computer operators).
UTP - Universal Trading Platform - Trading is now done through automation through the use of "Matching Engines" (which replace brokers) and "Market Makers" which (replaces specialists).
PUPPET - Maintains Operating System Integrity (Replacing system administrators).
RUBY ON RAILS - Allows for rapid development of applications through the use of visio like interfaces ( replacing software coders ).
ABINITIO - Like ruby on rails but specifically for trading applications ( replacing coders ).

Add in most major corporations are provisioning more money for automation then they are for new hires. One of the major reasons for this..is they don't want to be responsible for health care.

Automation, in itself, is a very good thing. But technology should be something that enhances the human ability to be productive..not replace it.

 

It does.

Those ticket kiosks allow people who would normally be stuck in dead end jobs processing tickets that have already been paid for to be offered more opportunity to work in other areas. The fact that companies do not have to keep hundreds of people sitting around doing nothing but answer phones keeps healthcare costs down by putting them into jobs where they can get up and move around more. They also get a chance to get more pay and better benefits.

Every supposed negative you can name I can counter with a positive from it, both for the person negatively affected and the country in general. I really believe you are not stupid enough to want us to go back to the point where half of the workforce was labor on farms, and half of the rest was digging ditches. Why are you crying about the modernization of the workforce moving us into the future?

Where do they reposition those 40 employees that were replaced with technology?

 

Most likely, they are offered other opportunities within the company. Perhaps training is required. Those that wish to advance themselves, stay. Those that do not, leave.
Sometimes those displaced workers are offered severance packages. It is what it is.
 
 
 
 
The President is full of shit! Obama is still trying to scapegoat his failure.

The plow & horse did not create permanent unemployment for farmers with hoes. The Steam Shovel did not do the same to ditch diggers & miners. There have been countless innovations throughout history that replace human labor. New jobs are always created by the advancements in lifestyles that outpaced the ones lost by labor replacing machine. If anything we have to many overeducated government dependent sissy's & to few blue collar workers to build oil pipelines & oil rigs, or operate drilling & mining equipment.

The only thing this country lacks is leadership.

 

The plow & horse did not create permanent unemployment for farmers with hoes

thats because the farmer usually did the work himself..... the the plow and horse just made his job easier.....same with the Tractor......but some machines have replaced people were there used to be hundreds working that job.....now there are just those feeding the machine and maintaining it....

The only thing this country lacks is leadership

i have been saying this quite often....

 

Innovation has wiped out over 90% of farm jobs!

I would like to see how many acres the average person could hoe by hand.  

Before the horse & plow farmers only farmed 20 acres.

 Farmers in the 1900s 

 
Over the course of the 20th century, fewer and fewer people were employed exclusively as farmers. 41 percent of the workforce in 1900 were employed on farms. In 2000, only 1.9 percent of the population work in agriculture. At the beginning of the century, farm families worked together on the farm. In 1930, one-third of the families had a family member who worked off the farm for more than 100 days. In 2000, 93 percent of farms were supported in part by off-farm income.

The number of farms in the United States has fallen by 63 percent since 1900. The farms, however, have grown in size. In 1900 the typical farm was between 100 and 200 acres. As the century progressed, farms became larger, especially those on the Great Plains and in the far West. By 1997, the average farm was nearly 500 acres.

 
 
 
 
 
Its amazing how liberals continue to vilify technology. If these nutjobs had their way we'd be living in tents without electricity. They don't want nuclear energy, coal energy, oil energy....and now not even automation which make higher quality products, because 'hey that was once a union job!'

 

It's amazing how Conservatives can see all this shit happening around them and then blame the people that are the casualties of this phenomena "lazy deadbeats" because they can't find a family sustaining job like they USED to have before they were replaced.

So tell me brilliant.... what happens when fully automated facilities happen? Artificial intelligence and robotics are getting to that point rather quickly. "lights out" manufacturing is in the very near future.

So I guess all the unemployed that result in that breakthrough will be deadbeats too. We are already at the point where there are very few jobs for everyday people other than menial crap. Sooner or later, it's going to have to get to the point where people have to come before profits in some way.

 

My you live in a very small paradigm.
 
 
 
thats because the farmer usually did the work himself.....the the plow and horse just made his job easier.....same with the Tractor......but some machines have replaced people were there used to be hundreds working that job.....now there are just those feeding the machine and maintaining it....

 

Do you see your logical flaw? Because the plow and horse made the job easier less workers were needed to do the same job. It had the same effect as your modern day example. Less are needed to do the same job. That frees up resources to grow and expand the economy everywhere else. The argument against technology is the argument that efficiency hurts economic growth. That defies all common sense and historical reality.

If you make the argument that machines destroy jobs, half our population should be perpetually unemployed due to the advances of the 20th century.

The argument is always the same: "textiles machines will put textile workers out of work" or "automobiles will put horse drawn carriage makers out of work" etc, etc. But the fact is these technologies are adopted because they are cheaper, better, and improve our standard of living. The money saved due to lower costs can be used to expand production elsewhere, creating more jobs anyway.

It is the fallacy of looking only at the effects of a policy on one group of people (those displaced by technology) and ignoring the effects of a policy on the whole (cheaper goods, more available resources, efficient production). It is the fallacy of looking at what is seen (the jobs replaced by machines) and ignoring the unseen (new jobs created to build the machines, and job growth in other industries. These other industries see growth because production technology functions to lower prices. Because of competition, consumer prices will fall, raising real income and allowing consumers to use their money in other industries. This demand will be answered with more employment in these other industries that will be forced to produce more).

Technology does not hurt net employment. It may shift it around in the short term, but in the long term we are all better off. Ultimately, it creates a more efficient economy that can support a growing population and raises the standard of living for all of us.
 
 
 
 
 
Its amazing how liberals continue to vilify technology. If these nutjobs had their way we'd be living in tents without electricity. They don't want nuclear energy, coal energy, oil energy....and now not even automation which make higher quality products, because 'hey that was once a union job!'

 

It's amazing how Conservatives can see all this shit happening around them and then blame the people that are the casualties of this phenomena "lazy deadbeats" because they can't find a family sustaining job like they USED to have before they were replaced.

This is the problem of conservatism in general. It caters to the elite and shits on everyone else.

Two real world examples off the top of my head:

My ex-wife was an institutional investor. She did write ups and various companies, sometimes having to visit the site. One such place was a condom company in the south. They were moving operations overseas. She interviewed the employees and not one knew what was about to happen. Several hundred people lost their jobs in one day.

Another was guy I heard about was a COBOL programmer. He programmed an application that tracked OTC bond trading and he was expected to do 24 by 7 support for it. This left him little time to do anything else. The company was upgrading the application and didn't tell him..fearing he would leave before they cutover. He had worked long and hard for them for some 20 or so years..and needed a couple of more years before he could retire. Well they cut over the application and fired the guy. At the age of 52 he was left without a job..benefits...no pension until 65..and very few shops were using COBOL.

This is the way the conservative world works.

 

SO you check the voting records and political affiliations of the owners/investors of those companies,right?
And "you heard about a guy"....You said he did the same thing for 20 years...This guy was of the intelligence that he could program complicated applications but was not smart enough to realize after 20 years he might just try moving his expertise forward to perhaps keep up with newer technologies?...Huh?
So government (taxpayers) should fix the guy you heard about? And of course you know the WHOLE story...Not just the parts you mentioned?
Jesus Christ.
 
 
 
 
 
California's main problem is..hold on..to much democracy.

Yep.

They vote themselves some very nutty things...like never raising taxes.

Then they put people in jail for life for stealing video tapes.

That's expensive..and stupid.

 

and the majority of those voters are?.....dont be afraid to say it....

 

Prop 13 was passed in 1978. The governor at the time was a Democrat, but he was preceded in office by eight years of Republican rule, and was followed by another 16. Except for 1964, the state had voted Republican in six straight presidential elections. Yeah, it's pretty hard to claim 1978 California was some liberal paradise.

 

Yet California gives us such right wingers as Diane Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, Jerry Brown, and Barbara Boxer......
Please do not even try to say California is not liberal. That's not even close to realistic

It's a pretty liberal state to be sure.

But they are more "liberatarian" style Liberals then say..New Yorkers are..

Which are more Daniel Moynihan style Liberals.

My girlfriend, who is pretty liberal (she designs for a packaging company) is nutty over taxes. She's a 15% flat tax advocate. To me that's pure lunacy.

 

Why is it nutty...
That is the most equitable way to tax. As a matter of fact, everything except income is taxed equally without regard to wealth or income. We all pay the same sales tax, same excise tax Same fees and taxes on our cell phones, land lines, cable, satellite,....
Here's how it might work......All income is taxed at 15% down to a minimum level...Lets' say 30,000 for a single person, $50k for a married couple....All other income with no ceiling is taxed at 15%. NO DEDUCTIONS of any kind.
Individuals still pay for social security. The income ceiling for SS is GONE...If a person earns two million, they pay 7.5% of two million....
Businesses pay their taxes the same as they do now. Same everything.

I'm sorry..you ever work in IT for a financial firm? You know what it's like? You have to carry a device with you 24/7, in the old days that was a beeper. Now it's a blackberry. They call you at all times. And you are expected to drop what you are doing and deal with the problem. Doesn't leave you much time to think about much else.

How did I "hear about the guy". Just who the fuck do you think converted his software?
 
 
 
 
 
Are you kidding? I've posted threads about things I've thought Obama has gotten wrong, like extending the Bush tax cuts, our continued war in Afghanistan, and trying to include bat shit crazy republicans into policy.

For the first time in history..corporations are spending more on "machines" then they are on new hires. That shouldn't be concern? That shouldn't be addressed?

That might mean a re-tooling skill sets for many..which means..financing proper education programs to do that.

Conservatives are dead set against that. One of the issues holding up trade agreements with South Korea is a provision to re-train workers displaced by the pact. Who's against that? Conservatives in Congress..of course. They want the agreement without that provision.

It's no wonder that conservatives are pooh-poohing this issue.

 

All of those people that are making all of those machines that corporations are buying are employed.

 

And?

If you got three people making one machine that gets rid of 80 jobs..well you think that's a good thing?

Or do you think we as a people should be doing something to mitigate the impact of such a move.

Like retraining the 80 people?

Or..do just ignore the whole fucking thing and say it was those 80 people that are at fault for not continually going to school to upgrade their skills.

In other words..working 40 or more hours a week..and spending the rest in training.

Constantly.

Always.

Forever..until they die.

Do you really want an economy where no one is sure of long term employment?

 

Oh cry me a river. It is each person's responsibility to advance themselves with education.
No job worth keeping would allow a person to remain stagnant.
SO what if one must work and go to school? It's not as though every person who does try to learn more is going to school full time?
For example, ASE Certified auto techs,must attend classes where they learn new technologies and familiarize themselves with new models.
In my business, I must take continuing education courses to maintain my certifications. If one wishes to remain marketable in a competitive job and career market, they must continue to learn new things. There is no sitting back.
 
 
I'm not gonna bother inserting myself into your conversations with quotes but I will say this. Why is the left so opposed to staying current with your education to the point that your marketable?

A) they prefer stagnation?

B) they prefer keeping their constituents dumb and needy?

And don't give me any of that have you ever worked IT BS. It's as if you have your industry on some kind of pedestal and no other industry is hurting in this economy. Every industry changes over time.

No way....Hey genius....IT... THAT IS THE BUSINESS THE GUY CHOSE!!!!!
He knew the parameters of the job. If he was not prepared for the for the potential of the 2am service call, he should have chosen another career path.
FYI, the business I am in, my cell phone stays on 24/7/365.....I had two calls on Christmas Day of 2010. One at 1 am Christmas morning.....No whining. I knew this could happen going in. I chose this career.
And about those voting habits of the company owners/investors?
All professions, careers have their trade offs. So what?.....What about when public safety people must go to jobs in the wee hours? Media people? While we are sleeping off our New Years Eve hangovers, there are tons of people working...So what.
You're making very little sense here.
 
 
So Mr. President... how many jobs have inventions like cars, aircraft, phones, television, movies, etc provided? The example this genius uses for lack of jobs is fewer tellers at banks with ATM machines.

Dumb ass.
 
 
 
Innovation has wiped out over 90% of farm jobs!

I would like to see how many acres the average person could hoe by hand.  

Before the horse & plow farmers only farmed 20 acres.

 

not what i was saying.....i dont care if the guy hoed 30 square yards.....as machines came into being....his job became easier and he was able to do more land by himself and his family........industry in the factories is were the machines replaced workers.....and in some industries it is still happening.....
 
 
 
I have no clue? Let me give you a clue!

At 16 years old I was certified as an adult and sent to prison. I did 3 years in a penitentiary built in the 1800's. While in prison I got my ged and nothing more. I married my girlfriend in my last year despite the fact that she was pregnant by another. When I got out I got my own student loans and went to college.
About a year later your precious uncle Sam sued me for all the aid they had given my wife during my last year in prison. They said pay or we will find the real father and make him pay (obviously bringing him into the picture when he wasn't wanted) Did I cry? No, I paid.
By now I have 2 children, I'm in school my wife is in school and were working days & nights.
Jobs are definitely harder for me to find then, than they are for anyone now because of my past. Yet we managed.
The trade school she was in went belly up and ultimately we had to continue paying her tuition fees. I dropped out of DeVry and bought an old highway patrol car. Painted it yellow and paid checker a 495 weekly franchise fee to use their dispatch and name. While driving I got an education in home building and blueprints. After finishing that school I sold my cab and used that money to buy the basic tools needed to start a remodeling company.
The first business failed within 2 years because I was ill prepared for the financial side of it. I muddled around for about a year doing your so called bs jobs until I could muster enough drive to try again. That was 20+ years ago. I have done a lot of HUD work in the last 10 years and have seen FIRST hand how the system is abused. Some projects I was even required to hire from within the community I was working in and pay them ridiculous prevailing wages. Like 17 dollars an hour just to push a broom.
I am now an award winning contractor who has been on the cover of industry magazines and have won awards from Angieslist for 6 of the last 7 years.

So in my opinion I have a very large clue about employment and how the govt and people alike abuse the system. In short if a scumbag like I used to be can go against all the odds to become a success story then I have no sympathy for those who havnt had near the hurdles I have.

Self reliance.

 

Because of the lack of message board knowledge of how to quote someone multiple times... I will separate your quote into numerical order.

1. What were you sent to prison for? None of my business... just out of curiosity. Surely it was not just from being "deemed an adult".

2. My "precious Uncle Sam"? You have got to be kidding me... I don't believe in Uncle Sam anymore than you believe in the Easter Bunny. My stance is that "Uncle Sam" is corrupt because of Big business and banking and only want to serve them. What you don't realize is that there is 10-100X the amount of people that don't fit in to the "business world" and need a decent paying job that they can raise their family's on. Too fucking bad if takes a billionaire's third vacation home away. The difference is.... you believe that "Uncle Sam" is corrupt because of the people that are committing welfare fraud. I firmly believe that Welfare Fraud is the lesser of two evils when compared to the Corporate welfare that is taking place across this country.

3. I have seen first hand the people that your side's agenda hurts. I have been working in the Mental Retardation(for those that lack the current understanding of the term DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED) field since 1986. What you DON'T understand is that when you choose to advocate for the dismantling of those pesky "entitlements", you are not hurting those you hate oh-so-much(the people taking advantage of the system), but those that I work with on a daily basis..... Why? Because the people you hate with such vigor can do one thing that those that I work with can't.... vote.

Finally... you do have a clue.... from YOUR perspective, and that's the problem I have with Conservatives in general. It's always from a person's perspective that does well for themselves. It's rarely from the perspective of the people that tried and lost to those that "made it".... and even on occasion when it does happen, it's NEVER from the perspective of people that have tried many times and ended up in the shitter.

Like I said... YOU have NO clue how things are skewed towards those with resources. I am really glad that you slipped through the cracks in an upward basis. You are a rarity... if you are not lying. Don't get me wrong.... I am not calling you a liar, it's just the medium we are using to communicate that makes lying an easy thing to do.... sorry for the non-intended slight, in advance.

And don't give me any of that have you ever worked IT BS. It's as if you have your industry on some kind of pedestal and no other industry is hurting in this economy. Every industry changes over time.

 

No one is saying that.

What people are saying is that... while some people may have the brainpower to aquire the skills of which you speak... other people don't and never will. So what you are saying is that even if EVERYONE relies on ROADS for their transportation needs(no matter how smart or dumb they may be), People who work on ROADS don't deserve a living wage because "anyone can do it".

I call you an elitist at the suggestion.

That defies all common sense and historical reality.

 

during the horse and plow days the farmer and his wife and kids did all the work on their farms themselves......as the Tractor came into being it made his job easier and now he was able to do more land........and more crops growing on more land he may have had to hire more people.....etc etc.....in some Industries....Automation has cut down the number of workers that used to work there.....is all im pointing out.....which is what this thread has evolved into......"do machines replace people or not?".....im all for Technology....im not against it......

You're assigning responsibilities to the regular folk you'd never assign to executives.

Gotta love it.

The people who work on roads deserve a free market wage like everyone else. Creating political unions excluding all the other people who are capable & willing to work on roads to earn a living is just plain wrong. Unless people succumb to your group think you exclude them from earning a living is just plain wrong.

Diversity creates, lock step PC group think destroys.

No, what you are saying is wrong. I live in PA. It is not a "right to work state" that you people love so much.... but is a state that recognizes collective bargaining as a legitimate ideology...... at this time.

Let me ask you something. real quick... What if the "Free Market... as you call it" deems a worker's worth at $1/hour, even though that is a ridiculous sum in the U.S.A.?

What is a person(family) to do? succumb to the idea that Chinese folk are working for that wage and deal with generational poverty, or demand better from the country that ALLOWED those entities to move offshore to help supplement the people displaced by their own profiteering?

Like you I dunno how to separate quotes. To make it worse I'm on my EVO and can only see the last paragraph you wrote so ill do my best to respond.

1) I was charged with multiple crimes. They all revolved around a drug deal that went bad and then a subsequent escape from a juvenile detainment facility. I pled the charges down to : aggravated juvenile delinquency, aggravated assault, terroristic threat and tampering with a state witness. I escaped the following: aggravated arson, 2 counts auto theft, possession of narcotics with intent to distribute and some other minor charges. My deal took me from facing 5 to 15 to 2 to 10 I'm sure my young age was also a factor in the light sentence. I served all 3 years in Kansas State Industrial Reformitory in Hutchison Kansas.

2) I don't disagree that not everyone can lead and some must follow. And yes I do agree that the lobbying system is corrupt as are many of the politicians. But that doesn't leave us powerless. The last landslide election cycle is proof of that. Not necessarily pro republican as it was anti corruption. If that message is sent often enough change is inevitable. There are honorable people in our govt. We just need to find more. Personally if I see one of my congressmen/women vote self pay raises vote legislation that benefits them in any manner I vote against them in the next cycle. If more people paid attention and voted this way we could effect change. But alas many just sit back and cry about having no input so its pointless.
As far as your corporate welfare stance we agree. Unfortunately ending ethanol subsidies just failed to pass. I have yet to see how my congressmen voted but I will, and emails will be sent accordingly.
Your wrong on entitlement and welfare fraud though. I saw it bigtime both when I drove my cab as well as when I worked 7-11 and when I worked for the ACOE on HUD and military installations.

3) You can't preach to me about the needs of the disabled as my step-daughter has CP. I whole heartedly agree with a full safety net for those that can't take care of themselves. She had around 9 different spine, leg, knee, and neck surgeries before I met her mother. All paid for by uncle Sam.
To your assertion that I have hate for a segment of our country. I don't. Those that can do should do. My problem with entitlements is that they are simply unsustainable in their current form. Means testing, raising the age and partially privatizing I think are all good ideas to start with.

We all have a clue. And all of those clues come from our own personal lives. To claim yours are more valid than mine is absurd. Most of us have something to offer its just a matter of taking "all the ideas" and finding out what will work best. Criminalizing profit with outrageous taxation is not the answer. You know as well as everyone should that giving uncle Sam more money only guarantees 1 thing... they will spend it. I am certainly not wealthy but that matters not. I earned my money just like they did and the govt is not entitled to their money just because they made more than me.

Things are skewed to those with ambition. Money can get you ahead faster but that's about it. And I didn't slip through the cracks, I broke them open with hard work and walked through them with my head held up.

Lastly I couldn't care less if someone thinks I'm lying. This is the net and I have nothing to gain from lying. I do however have something to gain by telling my story as it happened... inspiration for those that think they have none.

Thanks for being interested and responding.

Ps. This is a real pain in the ass on my EVO so please no more long questions. This one took me 30 damn minutes with all the scrolling up and down.
 
 
 
 
I'm not gonna bother inserting myself into your conversations with quotes but I will say this. Why is the left so opposed to staying current with your education to the point that your marketable?

A) they prefer stagnation?

B) they prefer keeping their constituents dumb and needy?

And don't give me any of that have you ever worked IT BS. It's as if you have your industry on some kind of pedestal and no other industry is hurting in this economy. Every industry changes over time.

 

No one is saying that.

What people are saying is that... while some people may have the brainpower to aquire the skills of which you speak... other people don't and never will. So what you are saying is that even if EVERYONE relies on ROADS for their transportation needs(no matter how smart or dumb they may be), People who work on ROADS don't deserve a living wage because "anyone can do it".

I call you an elitist at the suggestion.

 

I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm no elitist, I'm a realist. And I realize that the govt can't fix everything for everyone. Nor should it strive to do that. That would simply kill innovation and make too much of the population reliant on everyone but themselves.

 YouTube - &#x202a;Obama Blames High Unemployment on the ATM and Automation #atmfacts&#x202c;&rlm; 

 YouTube - &#x202a;Obama claims atms are killing jobs&#x202c;&rlm; 

Are you kidding? Look at all the jobs the machines create: invent, production, program with updates, maintain, market & sell, fill. Look at the money in production time they save us. All versus the 1 teller they "may" replace.
It's just sad that our president is so eager to excuse away his own inept policies that his excuse is just as pathetic as the results of his policies.

 

Sad excuse for his own Policies that are hindering any chance of Recovery and jeopardizing our Future. However that said, there is of course some truth to the premise. We have indeed lost many Jobs to machines, but what is the point of Crying about that, what are you going to do legislate that companies can not use Cheap Automation instead of Paid Labor? Really?

Good thing your Suspicions are usually not the Truth. Unless of course you have some link that shows us they are all Democrats. LOL
 
 
Ahh but you do have something to gain by lying... as do we all... the hopes of influencing other people to our own agenda... for no investment at all(other than time).

It's called Cheap advertising. Once again, I am not calling you a liar or anything close to that. But For all those following this thread... remember something. Things may not be as they seem.

I could be full of shit in my dialogue just as much as Grampa may be in his.

That is very important in this method of communication. You have no idea who is corresponding to you. That's why it is very important to NOT rely on only one side's perspective. Read Huffington Post AND heritage.org. Watch MSNBC AND FOX News. Listen to both the Conservative side AND the liberal... and do not demonize one side for the other. We are all Citizens and we all care about our country and it's people. We just disagree on how to accomplish it.
 
 
 
I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm no elitist, I'm a realist. And I realize that the govt can't fix everything for everyone. Nor should it strive to do that. That would simply kill innovation and make too much of the population reliant on everyone but themselves.

 

And I realize that Humongous Corporations and Wall Street kill more innovation and kill more Competition that the Government has done in the past 50 years(in this country, of course).

What you don't seem to get is that Corporatism is the "power behind the throne" so to speak.

Sure, we vote who we feel is right for the job, and hopefully... our candidate gets elected. But to those with almost ALL the resources? They don't give too much of a crap if it's one party or another. They own them all... because, quite simply... who has the money to finance INDIVIDUAL Campaigns... let alone... Primaries and such? No one... other than Big Business and Wall Street.

Sure, you may make your case about Unions... and they are legitimate... but if you take SEIU's PAC vs the whole Corporate Structure???? It's like pissing in the wind.
 
 
It amazes me how so many people have gotten this idea that it's someone else's responsibilty to provide a job for them. That they shouldn't have to come up with any ideas or put any effort into creating their own.

I've been unemployed. It sucks. (one of the reasons i dont know why anyone would want to retire). But you know what. If you don't put out any effort to create or find a job, you won't create or find one. It's not the President's responsibility to keep you employed. Nor is it the government's job to find you work. If they by some miracle actually do something that helps you then fabulous! But if you are always expecting someone else to give you what you want, youll never be happy or free.
 
 
I'd also point out that we aren't given the commandment that "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work unless your unemployed in which case you can take dont have to do anything till someone gives you something to do."

That's it? I give you a full and complete answer and that's it?
For the sake of your paranoia let's say it was all a lie. It's still founded in common sense.
Honestly, if you were just going to write it off like that why bother asking in the first place?
Do us a favor and just stick your head back in the sand. not everything is a conspiracy. And the fact that you can't handle the fact that someone from terrible circumstances could possibly pull themselves up without your precious handouts speaks volumes for your mentality. Sad......

I didn't even bother with this laughable post until it got some traction. The companies I recognize on the list are downsizing or off shoring.

So much for "automation", eh?
 
 
 
It amazes me how so many people have gotten this idea that it's someone else's responsibilty to provide a job for them. That they shouldn't have to come up with any ideas or put any effort into creating their own.

I've been unemployed. It sucks. (one of the reasons i dont know why anyone would want to retire). But you know what. If you don't put out any effort to create or find a job, you won't create or find one. It's not the President's responsibility to keep you employed. Nor is it the government's job to find you work. If they by some miracle actually do something that helps you then fabulous! But if you are always expecting someone else to give you what you want, youll never be happy or free.

 

That's funny..it really is.

No one here is suggesting that.

But heck. How well has any society done when the gulf between rich and poor become extremely wide?

Feel free.

Let us know when and where such cultures have done well.

No... it goes beyond that, slick. It goes into the realm of... "I can't pass a Civil Service Test and who are "they" to make a better living than me?"

All of us have the opportunity to become Public Employees who enjoy the benefit of Collective Bargaining.

Finally... I think it's bullshit... the idea that people don't put forth the effort to create of find a job. Prove that statement to me. Seriously. I want you to prove it to me... not with hearsay, not with "I've seen it for myself".... both of those things are easily dismissed in a legal setting, let alone an internet message board.

The truth is... very few people in this country is "expecting" to be given things. What people need is their jobs back that have been stolen from them by companies that support a Communist government over the Government that allowed them the very freedom that they abused.

I think they all ought to be tried for treason and deported to the country that they "fell in love with".

I met you half way in my responses and even conceded your valid points only for you to completely dismiss mine.

The truth is... very few people in this country is "expecting" to be given things. What people need is their jobs back that have been stolen from them by companies that support a Communist government over the Government that allowed them the very freedom that they abused.

I think they all ought to be tried for treason and deported to the country that they "fell in love with".

 

Why the hell should he goto the effort to answer your question when your just going to dismiss it straight away regardless of its validity?

I met you half way in my responses and even conceded your valid points only for you to completely dismiss mine.

 

Where have you met me "halfway"? Be saying that people are "always expecting others to give them what they want"?... is that 'halfway"? Or was it that people aren't "putting in any effort to create/find a job"... perhaps that was it.

You see? That's the problem with you guys... you already have your mind made up.. so there IS NO reasoning with you. It's either your way, or "Commie Talk". There is no in between.
 
 
 
 
 
No... it goes beyond that, slick. It goes into the realm of... "I can't pass a Civil Service Test and who are "they" to make a better living than me?"

All of us have the opportunity to become Public Employees who enjoy the benefit of Collective Bargaining.

Where did I meet you half way? Your kidding right? Are you blind or just lacking reading comprehension? I'll placate you and highlight a few but I suggest instead of just stating your view then blindly disregarding mine, actually read it. This just proves my point that you didn't actually want to debate but rather just make your points mixed with thinly veiled insults.

Here ya go:

) I don't disagree that not everyone can lead and some must follow. And yes I do agree that the lobbying system is corrupt as are many of the politicians. But that doesn't leave us powerless

As far as your corporate welfare stance we agree. Unfortunately ending ethanol subsidies just failed to pass. I have yet to see how my congressmen voted but I will, and emails will be sent accordingly.

You can't preach to me about the needs of the disabled as my step-daughter has CP. I whole heartedly agree with a full safety net for those that can't take care of themselves. She had around 9 different spine, leg, knee, and neck surgeries before I met her mother. All paid for by uncle Sam.

Now after your done eating your words ill be waiting for a "real" response to our discussion.
 
 
 
 
The people who work on roads deserve a free market wage like everyone else. Creating political unions excluding all the other people who are capable & willing to work on roads to earn a living is just plain wrong. Unless people succumb to your group think you exclude them from earning a living is just plain wrong.

Diversity creates, lock step PC group think destroys.

 

No, what you are saying is wrong. I live in PA. It is not a "right to work state" that you people love so much.... but is a state that recognizes collective bargaining as a legitimate ideology...... at this time.

Let me ask you something. real quick... What if the "Free Market... as you call it" deems a worker's worth at $1/hour, even though that is a ridiculous sum in the U.S.A.?

What is a person(family) to do? succumb to the idea that Chinese folk are working for that wage and deal with generational poverty, or demand better from the country that ALLOWED those entities to move offshore to help supplement the people displaced by their own profiteering?

 

All the apparel manufacturing left the country & you think road workers should be paid like kings. Road work can't be exported & will not go down to $1 an hour. It will drop to the average wage. Unions are currently a hiding place for people who could innovate or do more complex jobs that would advance society, but union employees will not because it would pay less than their low skilled union job.

All unions are good for is driving price inflation causing suffering for non-union workers.

Obama blames the rise of the machines for high unemployment.

 

I thought it was Bush's fault?
 
 
 
 
Obama blames the rise of the machines for high unemployment.

It was, until it stopped working. Now it's time to move it forward.
 
 
 
Actually, what this thread proves is that the left is mired in the past and doesn't have a clue about the dynamics of labor markets, innovation and technology. Labor needs change rapidly in today's world, fueled by the acceleration of technology advances.

Hell, in my field, which for the last decade or so has been almost exclusively devoted to accounting software and such, is now rapidly changing to total ERP solutions, etc. You adapt. I spend significantly more time these days learning new technology.. it's just the way it is.

 

And what does that have to do with the fact the Republicans have nothing better to offer?
 
 
 
 
The President is full of shit! Obama is still trying to scapegoat his failure.

The plow & horse did not create permanent unemployment for farmers with hoes. The Steam Shovel did not do the same to ditch diggers & miners. There have been countless innovations throughout history that replace human labor. New jobs are always created by the advancements in lifestyles that outpaced the ones lost by labor replacing machine. If anything we have to many overeducated government dependent sissy's & to few blue collar workers to build oil pipelines & oil rigs, or operate drilling & mining equipment.

The only thing this country lacks is leadership.

 

The plow & horse did not create permanent unemployment for farmers with hoes

thats because the farmer usually did the work himself.....the the plow and horse just made his job easier.....same with the Tractor......but some machines have replaced people were there used to be hundreds working that job.....now there are just those feeding the machine and maintaining it....

The only thing this country lacks is leadership

i have been saying this quite often....

 

Technology has not made it possible for fewer and fewer farmers to produce more and more farm product?

good one.  
 
 
 
 
All this subject proves is that the Republicans wouldn't have any better luck creating jobs even if you put them back in power.

There's not a single aspect of the GOP economic agenda that is going to overcome this reality of the shrinking pool of labor intensive businesses in the US.

 

Yea because as we all know if we lowered our corporate tax rate to compete with the rest of the world or removed some of the anti business regulations or make our nation a right to work nation that none of our jobs might come back. Hell even the burdens that unions put on our companies if relaxed could increase employment for everyone instead of just a select few.

I own a small remodeling business and when I've worked on large commercial jobs I've been picketed. Like someone else deserves the job more than me.

 

If you had bothered to research the topic you'd have found out that the tax cuts and credits that businesses have gotten are going into investment in machinery, not labor.

Not to mention the fact that we have what is essentially an employer based healthcare system that is eating up twice as big a percent of our GDP as most of our competitors.
 
 
 
 
There is validity to this.

Research departments of dozens are replaced with one person who knows how to perform boolean searches on the internet.

A team of switchboard operators are replaced by voice mail and only one receptionist for overflow

One secretary per executive is replaced by one secretary per 3 or 4 executives with advanced WP and graphics programs

A mailroom of multiple clerks is replaced by one or two mailroom people with the increase use of e-mail

Now...they may not sound like a lot of people...but when you spread it over tens of thousands of companies...it adds up.

With concern of head count...cost of insuring headcount......increase in employment regulations.....companies have been spending more money on new technology to accomodate growth as opposed to increasing the payroll

 

All of that has NOTHING to do with the recent spike in unemployment. All the semantic arguments in the world don't change anything. What Obama doesn't understand is that booksmarts =/= common sense, and sometimes that's all you need.

 

Actually the president's point is supported by independent objective research such as is exemplified by this article:

 Companies Accelerate Spending as U.S. Productivity Bypasses Jobs - Bloomberg 
 
 
 
 
 
Agreed

 

What I laid out earlier was why we have had prosperous times without a dramatic increase in employment percentage

Interestingly, as I see it (I am a business planner and human resource solutions consultant in NYC).....

in the last decade (2000-2007)....despite an increase in population, an increase in the retirement age, and an increase in major technoology (as I laid out earlier)....there was NOT an increase in unemployment except during times of recession (market saturation caused as is usually the norm)..

So when the pundits talk about how few jobs were created during the Bush years...they are either niave or disingenuous....

Truth is....people did quite well during those years...and unemployment was quite stable....and all of the negative ingredients were there for increased unemployment...

and by the way....recall Obamas one liner...

"are you better now than youy were 8 years ago".....he had the gall to ask that during a recession...if he had asked that question a year earlier...most would have said "hell yeah, Im a lot better off"

But he asked it during a recession when people are ALWAYS concerned....

He fooled the masses....and he still fools many of them.

The man is an asshole.

Enough said.

 

I also run a small business. Have for over 20 years. The downturn started affecting me at the end of June and it hasn't picked back up yet. Oddly enough I timed my losses to about the same time Obama became the nominee. Makes me think that along with all the other issues the prospect of him as president caused even more fear.

 

Ah yes the Obama presidency scared the business community so bad they practically doubled the stock market in 2 years.
 
 
The current unemployment rate in the U.S. for someone with a only a H.S. diploma is 9.5%

The current unemployment rate for someone with at least a bachelor's degree is 4.5%.

And yet, do Republicans/conservatives want to invest in Education?

Generally...

...No.
 
 
If education is the solution to the unemployment problem (I content that it really cannot be the solution because if anything, techology is replacing workers much faster than the workforce could ever adapt ) then consider the following about what's happening to education:

 
Over all, the report found, published college tuition and fees increased 439 percent from 1982 to 2007 while median family income rose 147 percent. Student borrowing has more than doubled in the last decade, and students from lower-income families, on average, get smaller grants from the colleges they attend than students from more affluent families.

 

 
Already, were one of the few countries where 25- to 34-year-olds are less educated than older workers.

 

 
Last year, the net cost at a four-year public university amounted to 28 percent of the median family income, while a four-year private university cost 76 percent of the median family income.

 

 
Among the poorest families  those with incomes in the lowest 20 percent  the net cost of a year at a public university was 55 percent of median income, up from 39 percent in 1999-2000. At community colleges, long seen as a safety net, that cost was 49 percent of the poorest families median income last year, up from 40 percent in 1999-2000.

 

 sources above 

Now consider what is happening in the manufacturing base in America.

 
U.S. manufacturing today.
  5.5 million   the number of manufacturing jobs lost in the last decade  roughly one-third of the manufacturing workforce.

  51,000   the number of manufacturing plants shuttered in the last decade.

  2.4 million   the number of American jobs lost or displaced between 2001-2008 due to our massive and growing trade deficit with China.

  40   the percent that Chinas currency is undervalued.

  83   the percent of our trade deficit in non-oil goods in 2009 attributable to China.

The thoughtless mantra:

Workers must adapt to advances in technology or die!

while correct, really offers no solution to the SYSTEMIC problem that mankind is facing.

Advances in efficiency due to modern techology replace workers but DOES NOT create alternative jobs for the displaced.

In point of fact, most workers whose jobs are lost to increases in efficiency CANNOT adapt by getting more education, folks.

Why not? Well think about it, folks.

The workforce is NOT all 20 something years olds, with higher than average IQs, and with unlimted capital to go back to school to start new careers.

Most people who lose their jobs are stuck where they live, with bills to pay and families to raise.

They are NOT kids. They are mid career with responsibilities they took on back when they were PRODUCTIVE members of society.

Our rapidly advancing tecnological society is moving on but does NOT offer any path for most displaced workers to take them along for the ride.

Let remember, also, shall we, that:

the median IQ in this nation is 100!

And it is PRECISELY those kinds of jobs that the AVERAGE worker could do that advances in efficiency are FOREVER DESTROYING.

You see...this is a systemic problem and one that as yet few of us are even willing to acknowledge.

 Unemployment rate for college grads is highest since 1970 - USATODAY.com 

Yet, the educated may now be bearing the brunt of a sluggish recovery. The jobless rate for high school graduates improved from 10.1% in October and is down from 10.9% in June. Maki partly credits a robust turnaround for restaurants, which added 34,000 jobs the past two months. And manufacturers added 134,000 from January to May.
At the same time, unemployment in the "management, business and financial" category leapt to 5.5% in November from 4.3% in September and is the highest on records back to 2000. Those figures are not seasonally adjusted. The broad category includes accountants and managers in human resources and food services. Many are occupations that require a college education.
Jorge Perez, a senior vice president for Manpower, says employers have cut layers of managers and melded jobs, reducing the need to hire. And, he says, some unemployed computer workers, for example, lack skills for the fast-changing field.
Harry Griendling, CEO of DoubleStar, a human resources consultant, cites employers' tendency to trim staff and enlist contractors for projects, partly due to uncertainty about taxes and health care reform. Many, he says, are more likely to make such cuts toward year's end as they plan annual budgets.

Ok.... Wow... you are a hothead. I guess I'm on your ignore list now... sorry for missing your post... and if you choose to look back in the posts... I was responding to a person named avatar... and you defended him, which is fine... you can defend anyone you want to... but unfortunately, I screwed up and thought you were avatar when I responded with the "Where have you met me half way" post.

So... at the risk of you not seeing this because I am now on your ignore list(which really doesn't bother me all that much), I will answer you.

What do you propose to do with those people who cannot lead? Are they screwed? Do they only deserve a life of poverty and want, or are they our fellow citizens that deserve a decent life too?

Ethanol subsidies? Ok... that is one of MANY ways our Government panders to the wealthy... but some of those people are not wealthy... they are mom and pop farmers trying to compete against full scale agribusiness. How about we end subsidies for Agribusiness, but keep them for family farms?

I can preach to you about the needs of the disabled. I have worked in the field since Reagan was in office and I have seen our resources dwindle and the calls for privatization rise. I have also seen the results of the trend. Private sector "Group Homes" are now what State Institutions Used to be in the 70's. They are staffed by minimum wage, unskilled people doing a job that requires much more training than these "for profit" entities are willing to provide. Plus, who gives a shit if you lose a minimum wage job? Lose a state job with benefits... that's a different story. You are going to tow the line a hell of a lot better.

Most of our Homeless problem is mentally ill people with no place to go. Reagan nearly killed Federal Funding to Mental Health Facilities... that put them on the street.

I am very sorry about your sister. But just because your sister is disabled does not make you an expert on what is happening around you.

Haha Thankfully I hadn't even had a chance to get to the ignore feature yet. Sounds like reading comprehension may in fact be in order if you were confused who you were talking too. Anyways onto the topic.

I think I was clear but if not let me reiterate my position. I'm against "ALL" corporate welfare. The free market should determine what is successful and what isn't.
As far as those that can't lead there are temporary safety nets available to them to help them until they rebound. ie food stamps, unemployment checks, Financial aid for families with children, etc. Other than that its not the govts job to find them employment.

I was a ward of the state from the age of 7 and I basically grew up in the system you work in. And as I clearly stated I have no problem with programs for those that can't help themselves. As far as funding goes, its kinda hard to hope for more when Obama spent everything we had and then some on such life changing programs as cash for clunkers and 2 billion for Egypt to help create jobs. Your party has had control of the purse strings for quite some time so to blame the right for lack of funding when you had control of the bank account for so long is disengiuness at best.

According to the study the college graduates are being impacted the worst.

Besides did you need a news story to tell you education was important? Duh, I've been saying that through this entire thread. Welcome to the party albeit a little late.
 
 
Funny how the MSM always ignores stupid things Democrats say. Imagine if the Palin had said this? The CNN & MSNBC nutters would be obsessing over it for years. Yup it's all the machines' fault. WOW!.
 
 
 
 
Do you see your logical flaw? Because the plow and horse made the job easier less workers were needed to do the same job. It had the same effect as your modern day example. Less are needed to do the same job. That frees up resources to grow and expand the economy everywhere else. The argument against technology is the argument that efficiency hurts economic growth. That defies all common sense and historical reality.

 

during the horse and plow days the farmer and his wife and kids did all the work on their farms themselves......as the Tractor came into being it made his job easier and now he was able to do more land........and more crops growing on more land he may have had to hire more people.....etc etc.....in some Industries....Automation has cut down the number of workers that used to work there.....is all im pointing out.....which is what this thread has evolved into......"do machines replace people or not?".....im all for Technology....im not against it......

 

And if the farmer buys more land because of the tractor and uses the same amount of work, he is not creating more jobs if he bought that land and hired workers to use a plow. Maybe that land was used by another farmer, but the tractor made the other farmer less efficient so he went out of business and lost his job. Technological advances in production always function to reduce the amount of people it takes to do a job. But my argument is that because of the resources it frees up, there will be more jobs everywhere else, so on net balance employment will not decrease and people may simply get jobs somewhere else. Do you agree with that?

during the horse and plow days the farmer and his wife and kids did all the work on their farms themselves......as the Tractor came into being it made his job easier and now he was able to do more land........and more crops growing on more land he may have had to hire more people.....etc etc.....in some Industries....Automation has cut down the number of workers that used to work there.....is all im pointing out.....which is what this thread has evolved into......"do machines replace people or not?".....im all for Technology....im not against it......

 

And if the farmer buys more land because of the tractor and uses the same amount of work, he is not creating more jobs if he bought that land and hired workers to use a plow. Maybe that land was used by another farmer, but the tractor made the other farmer less efficient so he went out of business and lost his job. Technological advances in production always function to reduce the amount of people it takes to do a job. But my argument is that because of the resources it frees up, there will be more jobs everywhere else, so on net balance employment will not decrease and people may simply get jobs somewhere else. Do you agree with that?

 

No... you will have more people without jobs. That is a given. What' not a given is that there will be other jobs(especially family sustaining jobs) out there. Throw in the trend of outsourcing and you have a severe job deficit with a growing population. All in the name of making a small group of people VERY RICH at the expense of everyone else. Why do you guys vote for a downward spiral that funnels money upward? It's counter intuitive.

He not only created more jobs, those jobs generally pay better than he would. Or do you think tractors grow on trees?

Then if that is what you believe, let me restate my earlier argument. Given the technological advances of the 20th century, half the population should be unemployed. Outsourcing has increased, and technology has boomed. Why is there not significant perpetual unemployment if technological advances and outsourcing create net job loss?

You are operating on the fallacy of looking at the effects of a policy on one group and ignoring everyone else. Yes, the work machines do will cause human workers to be displaced. But people have to make the machines. Not only that, because machines are cheaper than workers, businesses will be able to sell their products at a cheaper and more competitive price. This means that everyone in the economy will get that good cheaper. They will have more money left over to demand other goods. That demand will result in increased production and more employment in many other industries. You just can't trace these industries exactly.

Let us take this example. A company using human workers make fur coats that cost $40 each. With machines, they can cut the price to attract more buyers and sell the coats for $20 each. Say that 10 million Americans buy fur coats. Rather than spend 400 million on the coats, they spend 200 million, and have 200 million left over. That additional $200 million will be spent and invested in other parts of the economy, creating growth and employment in whatever sectors it ends up in.

Empirically, the evidence does not show technology creates net unemployment. Logically, it makes no sense to think so. In conclusion, technology changing the structure of production, but does not result in long term increases in unemployment.
 
 
Wow who would have thunk,Obama blames something or someone else for his shortcomings.
 
 
 
 
 
The President is full of shit! Obama is still trying to scapegoat his failure.

The plow & horse did not create permanent unemployment for farmers with hoes. The Steam Shovel did not do the same to ditch diggers & miners. There have been countless innovations throughout history that replace human labor. New jobs are always created by the advancements in lifestyles that outpaced the ones lost by labor replacing machine. If anything we have to many overeducated government dependent sissy's & to few blue collar workers to build oil pipelines & oil rigs, or operate drilling & mining equipment.

The only thing this country lacks is leadership.

 

The plow & horse did not create permanent unemployment for farmers with hoes

thats because the farmer usually did the work himself.....the the plow and horse just made his job easier.....same with the Tractor......but some machines have replaced people were there used to be hundreds working that job.....now there are just those feeding the machine and maintaining it....

The only thing this country lacks is leadership

i have been saying this quite often....

 

Technology has not made it possible for fewer and fewer farmers to produce more and more farm product?

good one.  

 

i dont think thats what i said....but since its coming from you....im not surprised....your good at twisting things.....
 
 
Honestly guys this thread has nothing to do with how land was farmed in the early 1900's. We have real issues and this discussion has gotten so misguided and trivial that we look as dumb as Obama.

Obama is not advocating elimination of ATMs or airport kiosks. he only points to them as an example of where technology advancements have eliminated jobs previously done by people.
 
 
 
The current unemployment rate in the U.S. for someone with a only a H.S. diploma is 9.5%

The current unemployment rate for someone with at least a bachelor's degree is 4.5%.

And yet, do Republicans/conservatives want to invest in Education?

Generally...

...No.

 

yet most of the unemployment checks i deliver are to college grads with 4 year degrees or better who tell me the job market for them sucks....

No one ever said he called for the end of the machines. Way to completely miss the point. And those jobs that were eliminated suddenly only happened on his watch despite the machines being around for decades? And by the way for every atm put on the street corner 4 jobs are created. Nice job exposing your stupidity and lack of economic understanding. Are you sure your name isn't Obama?

Another clueless conservative. Welcome to the board, we were running short

Obama was using ATMs as an example of how technology eliminates jobs formerly held by people. He is far from a Ludite. he was merely making an analogy
 
 
 
 
 
Where did I meet you half way? Your kidding right? Are you blind or just lacking reading comprehension? I'll placate you and highlight a few but I suggest instead of just stating your view then blindly disregarding mine, actually read it. This just proves my point that you didn't actually want to debate but rather just make your points mixed with thinly veiled insults.

Here ya go:

) I don't disagree that not everyone can lead and some must follow. And yes I do agree that the lobbying system is corrupt as are many of the politicians. But that doesn't leave us powerless

As far as your corporate welfare stance we agree. Unfortunately ending ethanol subsidies just failed to pass. I have yet to see how my congressmen voted but I will, and emails will be sent accordingly.

You can't preach to me about the needs of the disabled as my step-daughter has CP. I whole heartedly agree with a full safety net for those that can't take care of themselves. She had around 9 different spine, leg, knee, and neck surgeries before I met her mother. All paid for by uncle Sam.

Now after your done eating your words ill be waiting for a "real" response to our discussion.

 

Ok.... Wow... you are a hothead. I guess I'm on your ignore list now... sorry for missing your post... and if you choose to look back in the posts... I was responding to a person named avatar... and you defended him, which is fine... you can defend anyone you want to... but unfortunately, I screwed up and thought you were avatar when I responded with the "Where have you met me half way" post.

So... at the risk of you not seeing this because I am now on your ignore list(which really doesn't bother me all that much), I will answer you.

What do you propose to do with those people who cannot lead? Are they screwed? Do they only deserve a life of poverty and want, or are they our fellow citizens that deserve a decent life too?

Ethanol subsidies? Ok... that is one of MANY ways our Government panders to the wealthy... but some of those people are not wealthy... they are mom and pop farmers trying to compete against full scale agribusiness. How about we end subsidies for Agribusiness, but keep them for family farms?

I can preach to you about the needs of the disabled. I have worked in the field since Reagan was in office and I have seen our resources dwindle and the calls for privatization rise. I have also seen the results of the trend. Private sector "Group Homes" are now what State Institutions Used to be in the 70's. They are staffed by minimum wage, unskilled people doing a job that requires much more training than these "for profit" entities are willing to provide. Plus, who gives a shit if you lose a minimum wage job? Lose a state job with benefits... that's a different story. You are going to tow the line a hell of a lot better.

Most of our Homeless problem is mentally ill people with no place to go. Reagan nearly killed Federal Funding to Mental Health Facilities... that put them on the street.

I am very sorry about your sister. But just because your sister is disabled does not make you an expert on what is happening around you.

 

Haha Thankfully I hadn't even had a chance to get to the ignore feature yet. Sounds like reading comprehension may in fact be in order if you were confused who you were talking too. Anyways onto the topic.

I think I was clear but if not let me reiterate my position. I'm against "ALL" corporate welfare. The free market should determine what is successful and what isn't.
As far as those that can't lead there are temporary safety nets available to them to help them until they rebound. ie food stamps, unemployment checks, Financial aid for families with children, etc. Other than that its not the govts job to find them employment.

I was a ward of the state from the age of 7 and I basically grew up in the system you work in. And as I clearly stated I have no problem with programs for those that can't help themselves. As far as funding goes, its kinda hard to hope for more when Obama spent everything we had and then some on such life changing programs as cash for clunkers and 2 billion for Egypt to help create jobs. Your party has had control of the purse strings for quite some time so to blame the right for lack of funding when you had control of the bank account for so long is disengiuness at best.
It was my step-daughter with CP (reading comprehension?)

 

The problem is... the market isn't really free when big corporations have such a huge head start from previous pandering. You can't just wipe the slate clean and expect new growth to flourish when the "haves" of the business community already have virtual monopolistic entities. Those huge conglomerates need broken up. It's kind of like clear cutting a forest to allow for new growth.

I'm not blaming the "right" alone... I am blaming Politics. Both sides are beholden to larger entities than the general citizenry. If you think that those policies should continue because it happens to benefit Right Wing candidates more at this point in time... I don't know what to tell you. But the simple truth is... to be a Candidate... you need Money... Lots of it. Corporations have lots of money... but they want something in return for that money.... influence buying and favorable legislation. This is where America has taken a turn for the worse over the last 30 years or so.

We need to turn America back to a "We the People" nation, rather than a "We the people with the most money". Because our middle class is collapsing and our poor are growing because of this crazy methodology. Both sides are to blame.

Look logically(not emotionally) at the Health Care Law. With our current situation...Spending 1st... quality... 30-something... A single payer system was the way to go... At the very least.. having a Public OPTION would have added teeth to the Health Care law.

It would have given small business a huge break to compete with the big boys in terms of cost effectiveness. Let's suppose you are a young man... just starting out with a wife and a kid on the way.... You have two job offers(to make it simple). One is with a huge conglomerate where you are just an anonymous employee that pays benefits... and the other is with a small company that has decent potential... but can't afford to pay benefits... who are you going to go with? Let's take it another route... you are an employee of the Conglomerate.. but you absolutely hate your job... but they pay you pretty well and they supply you with Health Care at a minimal cost. Some co-worker that is just as sick of the BS as you says... let's start a business of our own! You'd need to hire ohhh.. let's say 50 people to get it off the ground, but you can't get them because they need Health insurance for their families and you can't provide that.

THAT is what the Health Care Law was supposed to do. Give Small business a tool to compete... but the Corporate Sponsored Media and their multi-billion dollar marketing campaign for the status quo suckered so many people into the "Socialism" thing that the law never got the teeth that it needed.

As far as the mistake of your STEP DAUGHTER... sorry about that... but the point still remains.

Obama blames the rise of the machines for high unemployment.

 

The reason Obama's speeches have to be scripted is because left on his own he'll spew crap that proves he's completely out of touch with the real world. Turn the teleprompter off and he's a complete idiot.
 
 
I haven't listened to the comments but coming from Fox i would expect nothing but BS.
 
 
I think this is great. once all the people who can only perform manual labor die off, then the rest of us can progress

So what? are fucking blind or stupid? You tell me... because I am at a loss.

No one is saying that technology and robotics are a bad thing.... just that, if you are going to have such labor saving devices.... then one has a RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that REAL PEOPLE are still being taken care of financially.

Like I proposed before.. what if most industries become "lights out" facilities that require little to no human intervention? Fuck those former "productive people"... right?

In short... Conservatives are setting themselves up in their own demise... they are just to damned stubborn to realize it. When it happens(and it will) there won't be much of anything in the way of jobs.... It will go back to the days of "Company stores, Company towns, and Company lifestyles".

Tennessee Ernie Ford said it best in his song... "16 Tons", which was referring to the Coal Mining Trade at the time.

"You load 16 tons, what do you get? Another Day Older and deeper in debt... St. Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go... I owe my soul to the Company Store".

This is what you are gradually advocating. it will take time to undo the work that Collective Bargaining has done over the decades... but make no mistake.... that is the goal of the Conglomerate. To maximize their profits and minimize the value of labor.

life will be great when we only need scientists and engineers to thrive and perform new research while robots do the rest of the work. all the dumbasses will die off due to lack of brain power / formal education and the world will really advance

But what everyone has been saying contrary to your opinion is that those people don't stay unemployed, and these machines do not result in net unemployment. People need to make the machines, to build the machines, and because machines make cost of production cheaper, more goods can be produced, which lowers prices, gives people higher real wages, and allows more money to be spent on other goods. Employment will increase in those industries as a result. There is no net job loss, just of shift of where people work.

Simply saying they eliminate jobs is ignoring the whole picture. These machines also create many new jobs and give work to people who would not have had work before. To say they eliminate jobs insinuates they do not create any. Which is completely false. That is the point, and that is why Obama's statement is out of touch with reality.

You'd need to hire ohhh.. let's say 50 people to get it off the ground, but you can't get them because they need Health insurance for their families and you can't provide that.

THAT is what the Health Care Law was supposed to do. Give Small business a tool to compete... but the Corporate Sponsored Media and their multi-billion dollar marketing campaign for the status quo suckered so many people into the "Socialism" thing that the law never got the teeth that it needed.

As far as the mistake of your STEP DAUGHTER... sorry about that... but the point still remains.

 

I mostly agree with your first 2.5 paragraphs. But the rest well have to agree to disagree.
 
 
 
 
 
What is your solution, send everyone back to the stone age?

 

Not at all... My solution is to quit thinking that Billionaires deserve all they can get and everyday people should just be happy they have a job... even one that don't even pay for their essentials.

 

That's not a solution, it is a whine.

 

No... what is a whine is thinking a small part of your (probably minimal) tax dollars supports someone who doesn't work. even though a much larger part supports people who either can't or have fallen on temporary bad times.

In short... for every person you show that is abusing the system, I can probably(with enough effort) show 50 that isn't.

But much like your side's speculation that everyone on welfare is a deadbeat... My speculation is that the vast majority of the people on what you call welfare are either handicapped to the point of being non-productive.... or temporarily in need of said services.
 
 
 
So what? are fucking blind or stupid? You tell me... because I am at a loss.

No one is saying that technology and robotics are a bad thing.... just that, if you are going to have such labor saving devices.... then one has a RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that REAL PEOPLE are still being taken care of financially.

 

We should tax everyone who uses an ATM, computer, ticket kiosk, or any other labor saving device in order to support people who are too stupid to find a job because of technology.

UOTE=Steelplate;3764842] Like I proposed before.. what if most industries become "lights out" facilities that require little to no human intervention? Fuck those former "productive people"... right?[/quote]

That has been happening for years. Somebody here was just complaining about the lack of innovation in the US. I turn around and you are whining about the innovation. Both of you blame conservatives.

UOTE=Steelplate;3764842]In short... Conservatives are setting themselves up in their own demise... they are just to damned stubborn to realize it. When it happens(and it will) there won't be much of anything in the way of jobs.... It will go back to the days of "Company stores, Company towns, and Company lifestyles".

Tennessee Ernie Ford said it best in his song... "16 Tons", which was referring to the Coal Mining Trade at the time.

"You load 16 tons, what do you get? Another Day Older and deeper in debt... St. Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go... I owe my soul to the Company Store".

This is what you are gradually advocating. it will take time to undo the work that Collective Bargaining has done over the decades... but make no mistake.... that is the goal of the Conglomerate. To maximize their profits and minimize the value of labor.[/QUOTE]

I do see something here, but it is not what you see. What I see is a group of people that want to blame all the worlds problems on a specific group of people just because you think you are smarter than they are. You're not, you are just as silly and blind as they are.
 
 
 
I haven't listened to the comments but coming from Fox i would expect nothing but BS.

 

Quit being a hack and just watch the second video. Ignore the commentary if you like but listen to Obama in his own words.
 
 
 
 
Obama blames the rise of the machines for high unemployment.

 

The reason Obama's speeches have to be scripted is because left on his own he'll spew crap that proves he's completely out of touch with the real world. Turn the teleprompter off and he's a complete idiot.

 

He's not that bright with the Teleprompter On.

Tell you what, go find all the posts I made about people abusing the system by not working, then come back here. After you do that you can address the points I am actually making here, which is that your theory that automation is bad is so far off that you have to resort to accusing me of saying things I am not.
 
 
 
 YouTube - &#x202a;Obama Blames High Unemployment on the ATM and Automation #atmfacts&#x202c;&rlm; 

 YouTube - &#x202a;Obama claims atms are killing jobs&#x202c;&rlm; 

Are you kidding? Look at all the jobs the machines create: invent, production, program with updates, maintain, market & sell, fill. Look at the money in production time they save us. All versus the 1 teller they "may" replace.
It's just sad that our president is so eager to excuse away his own inept policies that his excuse is just as pathetic as the results of his policies.

 

Look how many jobs from machines--were stolen from Obama--   He must have not known that what took thousands of men with shovels to build roads in bridges in the 1930's can now be done with a couple of those dang heavy equipment operators--  
 
 
 
I mostly agree with your first 2.5 paragraphs. But the rest well have to agree to disagree.

 

What part don't you agree with? the point that health care is more of a benefit to the Conglomerate than it is to the worker? look at the history of employer based health care and the direction it's turned.

Furthermore... look at the educational system and the direction it's turned... It used to be that people could get degrees... even Bachelor's degrees with little sacrifice. But now.... it's to the point that most people end up with 75-100K in debt by the time they graduate from a 4 year program.

That is a huge advantage to entities that want employees to stick around for a while, isn't it? Take a man/woman... who just got married out of college.. perhaps has a kid on the way... take the health care problem that I already spoke of... and add it to the debt that the said person acquired getting their education.... we are talking a huge advantage to the "already established" Conglomerate vs. the upstarts.

It's all about keeping the status quo and removing any potential competition. That's why I call your "Free Market" Capitalism a total farce. It's not Capitalism... it's Conformity and monopolistic endeavors.
 
 
"Let them eat cake." - Obama
 
 
This really reminds me of the comments he made last month, where he told us that the issue isn't uncertainty. That companies just need to start hiring.  YouTube - &#x202a;Obama on jobs: "It's time for companies to step up"&#x202c;&rlm; 

He just doesn't understand how this economy works. He's got businesses large and small convinced he's going to punish them with more taxes, so why invest now? It's like he's saying, 'It's not my policies, it's just that the companies won't step up.' And now it's, 'Well, the machines have taken over.' Fingers pointed every which way except at him.

Now I want all you liberals to give up those dang android aka smart phones. Don't you know how many of those traveling salesmen--selling encyclopidia's you're putting out of a job?
 
 
Someone should tell Obama that ATM's where around long before he came along, and they did not effect the economy then, all of a sudden they are now?
 
 
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that advancement in technology will make some jobs obsolete.

And it is relevant to the current situation when you factor in that we've also fallen behind in producing engineers. All of these advancements in technology are being made by China or Japan and not the US (I'm not even talking about ATM's). These are the jobs that are growing rapidly and are in high demand.

I get tired of conservatives going back to one of their cliches and say oh "these companies are not hiring because they're worried about potential tax increases." No, it's not that or at most that's a small part of it. The fact is that our education system now sucks in this country and we're not producing engineers who are in high demand at virtually any company. If you have more engineers then the company becomes more efficient, more profitable and in turn they can hire more people in other areas of the company. It's a lot more complex then companies being worried about taxes going up.

It's not even remotely related to the problem. These evil machines have been around for decades. Last time I checked they weren't recently invented to replace anyone. It's just reaching. It's a ridiculous distraction that the main steam media didn't even have the balls to call him on. I defy you to tell me the media isn't in his pocket after all the years of calling GWB stupid.

Do you see your logical flaw? Because the plow and horse made the job easier less workers were needed to do the same job. It had the same effect as your modern day example. Less are needed to do the same job. That frees up resources to grow and expand the economy everywhere else. The argument against technology is the argument that efficiency hurts economic growth. That defies all common sense and historical reality.

 

during the horse and plow days the farmer and his wife and kids did all the work on their farms themselves......as the Tractor came into being it made his job easier and now he was able to do more land........and more crops growing on more land he may have had to hire more people.....etc etc.....in some Industries....Automation has cut down the number of workers that used to work there.....is all im pointing out.....which is what this thread has evolved into......"do machines replace people or not?".....im all for Technology....im not against it......

 

And if the farmer buys more land because of the tractor and uses the same amount of work, he is not creating more jobs if he bought that land and hired workers to use a plow. Maybe that land was used by another farmer, but the tractor made the other farmer less efficient so he went out of business and lost his job. Technological advances in production always function to reduce the amount of people it takes to do a job. But my argument is that because of the resources it frees up, there will be more jobs everywhere else, so on net balance employment will not decrease and people may simply get jobs somewhere else. Do you agree with that?

 

No, the emboldened sentence is where you're missing the point.

That is NOT what is happening.

Back when the USA was migrating from an agricultural nation to an industrialized nation, the folks coming off the farms could find work in the expanding industrial base.

Additionally, they were qualified to assume those positions because factory work was something most people could do.

But the advances in technology now are NOT creating opportunities for as many workers as those advances are displacing.

And WORSE, the advances in technology are moving UP THE EMPLOYMENTS SKILLS FOODCHAIN, TOO.

We are systenmatically making an increasingly larger percentage of our population (and this IS happening worldwide, too) ECONOMICALLY unviable.

IN the 19th century it was farm laboring jobs that machines and technology eliminated.

In the later half of the 20th century it was industrial and clerical jobs that advances in technology started replacing.

In the beginning of THIS CENTURY we're seeing advancing technology replacing formerly highly skilled workers.

And the number of jobs that are created to service this techological society is a pittance compared to the numbers of jobs that the technology is replacing.

In the last 15 year techology has replaced 6 workers in my tiny tiny operation. While I am able to increase my output my laboring force went down 75%

Multiply my experience by thousands and thousands of small and medium and large businesses, and you discover that we are created an ENTRENCHED SYSTEMIC class of people who are virtually UNEMPLOYABLE.

Now how does that effect every one of us, regardless of how secure we might be in our current billets?

The under and unemployable do NOT pay taxes, they do NOT purchases goods and they do become a drag on society precisely because, while willing to work, there is no job that will pay them enough to BE good citizens and consumers in this CONSUMER DRIVEN economy.

We are creating a SYSTEMIC problem in this society and aren't even talking about it realistically

Every time this issue comes up, people dismiss it by proposing that people just need more education.

But as I have already point out, even EDUCATED people are being effected by this problem, because techological advances in THINKING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS are making even well educated people REDUNDANT.

It's time to START thinking about how we deal with a problem that is now manifesting and threatening not just the stupid and skilless, but the well educated and highly skilled workers, too.

This problem will not go away because techological advances are taking jobs from people such that there is no educational path that any worker can take that will INSURE that they won't be reducatant TOMORROW.

Many software programmers are just now beginning to feel that pinch.

I can assure you that sooner or later most people who depend on working (be it with their hands or with their heads) for their rice bowls are going to become redundant.

The ONLY socultion to this is a radical RETHINK of the social contract.

Market forces do NOT have a solution for this problem, folks.

Why not?

Because our economic system is based on a theory of SCARCITY AND WANT.

But techology is creating a system of PLENTY produced by less and less workers.

Unhappily, one needs to be linked into that economy system with economically viable employment to garner the income to take advantage of it.

But as the PROFITS go only to the CAPITALISTS, the working classes grow poorer and poorer until the economy we have in place no longer SERVES the people in it.

Right now I'd say about 20% of the population of all workers are basically REPLACEABLE by machines.

In ten years? Add some more percent of the workforces to that problem

In twenty years, most of you who are feeling so sanguine because you currently have marketable skills?

You're hosed, too.

And believe me when I tell you that very few of your will have the resources or even the mental acuity to retrain for a job that you can do better or more cheaply than a thinking machine.

If you are right that there are simply not enough new jobs to go around we will see signs of that at some point. Presently no one, except for a few nutcases, is saying that. Everyone is saying that the current unemployment numbers are just a blip and that the economy will eventually recover.

If Palin had said this,the CNN & MSNBC stooges would have obsessed over it for years. Our MSM is so Liberal/Democrat Biased. When Democrats say stupid things,they pretend it didn't happen. But God forbid a Republican say something they don't like. And the only Machine i blame for high unemployment is the Hopey Changey One's Teleprompter Machine. It continues to make him stay such stupid shit.
 
 
Palin is going to destroy Obama with that during the debates.

He has a record of total failure and he blames ATM's for it.

"You know Barry, we had ATM's in Alaska when I was governor. The high unemployment seems to come from your failed policies."

(I condenced your rant)

You are to far in the future. That is clearly not what happened in the situation our country finds itself in now. Over the past dozen years to much undo leverage & credit was given to to many for homes & things of little value. This drove mal investment & our work force into rising assets & away from manufacturing, innovation, science & technology. That stuff all went overseas to low regulated manufacturing friendly placed with idle workers.

We invested in nesting instead of manufacturing & technology. Most of the stuff we buy is still made by people or people assisted automation. The machines are not the ones that took most of the jobs yet, but it may be coming over the next 20 years.

You may be dreaming of the future when machines take care of our needs. When our main responsibility is maintaining social contracts, good mental & physical health. Where councilors, psychiatrist & doctors make-up the critical part of the workforce. Where our main function is being a good citizen, helping others, dreaming up new innovations, advancements, intergalactic travel, planetary colonization & resource mining.

The problem is we have to many large gaps in our technology to achieve a lot of this. Innovation has not kept up with population growth. Once everyone in the world can have anything they desire by commanding a machine to make it, the #1 problem will be raw materials & resources. Resource wars will be the issue instead of social contracts.

I just find it pretty damn funny that this is something you can jump all over Obama for quite honestly.

 

Honestly, I don't think you'll hear Obama utter one unscripted word until after the election.
 
 
Who needs Obama unscripted when we got Biden the blundering idiot. Even with a script he screws chit up.
 
 
 
 
 
More rightwing misdirection

Obama is not advocating elimination of ATMs or airport kiosks. he only points to them as an example of where technology advancements have eliminated jobs previously done by people.

 

And I ask again, so what?

 

So what? are fucking blind or stupid? You tell me... because I am at a loss.

No one is saying that technology and robotics are a bad thing.... just that, if you are going to have such labor saving devices.... then one has a RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that REAL PEOPLE are still being taken care of financially.

Like I proposed before.. what if most industries become "lights out" facilities that require little to no human intervention? Fuck those former "productive people"... right?

In short... Conservatives are setting themselves up in their own demise... they are just to damned stubborn to realize it. When it happens(and it will) there won't be much of anything in the way of jobs.... It will go back to the days of "Company stores, Company towns, and Company lifestyles".

Tennessee Ernie Ford said it best in his song... "16 Tons", which was referring to the Coal Mining Trade at the time.

"You load 16 tons, what do you get? Another Day Older and deeper in debt... St. Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go... I owe my soul to the Company Store".

This is what you are gradually advocating. it will take time to undo the work that Collective Bargaining has done over the decades... but make no mistake.... that is the goal of the Conglomerate. To maximize their profits and minimize the value of labor.

 

Taken care of?...By whom?
The only responsibility here is for each of us to take care of our selves.
Each of us as individuals have the responsibility to improve our skill sets and make our selves marketable in the job force.
Looks like on Planet Steeplate, companies should be prepared to "make work" for anyone who may be displaced by technology.
What you suggest is lunacy.
One of the main reasons why US industry is lagging behind the rest of the worlds dominant industrial nations is US industries failed to modernize plants. These companies became non competitive in the global marketplace.
And of course we get to the root of your whiny
ant.....Collective bargaining. Look genius, part of the reason why US based industry lags behind is having to cow tow to the unions. Unions made American labor so expensive and so lacking in productivity as compared to the developing industrial nations, companies had no choice but to boot the unions out and modernize facilities.
Do you really think business owners wanted to spend billions collectively to construct new plants in other countries while having to write off huge losses? It takes years to recoup those investments.
 
 
 
 
 
well now that you've cleared it up for all of us dummies we can rest easy.

 

I'm not trying to act like you're dumb. I just think this is what Obama was trying to say but he was trying to dumb it down.

 

He thinks people are too stupid to understand the economy, so he says dumb things to people? Why are you supporting someone who treats you like that?

 

The democrat party believes Americans to be ignorant--as it takes ignorance to vote for them.

It appears that our Harvard graduate--community organizer--most intellectual President-EVER-has just discovered something- that-we (the common peasants) have known for decades.
 
 
 
Who needs Obama unscripted when we got Biden the blundering idiot. Even with a script he screws chit up.

 

Will Biden be running for president?

***Who the fuck left the gate to the idiot farm open?***
 
 
 
 
 
during the horse and plow days the farmer and his wife and kids did all the work on their farms themselves......as the Tractor came into being it made his job easier and now he was able to do more land........and more crops growing on more land he may have had to hire more people.....etc etc.....in some Industries....Automation has cut down the number of workers that used to work there.....is all im pointing out.....which is what this thread has evolved into......"do machines replace people or not?".....im all for Technology....im not against it......

 

And if the farmer buys more land because of the tractor and uses the same amount of work, he is not creating more jobs if he bought that land and hired workers to use a plow. Maybe that land was used by another farmer, but the tractor made the other farmer less efficient so he went out of business and lost his job. Technological advances in production always function to reduce the amount of people it takes to do a job. But my argument is that because of the resources it frees up, there will be more jobs everywhere else, so on net balance employment will not decrease and people may simply get jobs somewhere else. Do you agree with that?

 

No, the emboldened sentence is where you're missing the point.

That is NOT what is happening.

Back when the USA was migrating from an agricultural nation to an industrialized nation, the folks coming off the farms could find work in the expanding industrial base.

Additionally, they were qualified to assume those positions because factory work was something most people could do.

But the advances in technology now are NOT creating opportunities for as many workers as those advances are displacing.

And WORSE, the advances in technology are moving UP THE EMPLOYMENTS SKILLS FOODCHAIN, TOO.

We are systenmatically making an increasingly larger percentage of our population (and this IS happening worldwide, too) ECONOMICALLY unviable.

IN the 19th century it was farm laboring jobs that machines and technology eliminated.

In the later half of the 20th century it was industrial and clerical jobs that advances in technology started replacing.

In the beginning of THIS CENTURY we're seeing advancing technology replacing formerly highly skilled workers.

And the number of jobs that are created to service this techological society is a pittance compared to the numbers of jobs that the technology is replacing.

In the last 15 year techology has replaced 6 workers in my tiny tiny operation. While I am able to increase my output my laboring force went down 75%

Multiply my experience by thousands and thousands of small and medium and large businesses, and you discover that we are created an ENTRENCHED SYSTEMIC class of people who are virtually UNEMPLOYABLE.

Now how does that effect every one of us, regardless of how secure we might be in our current billets?

The under and unemployable do NOT pay taxes, they do NOT purchases goods and they do become a drag on society precisely because, while willing to work, there is no job that will pay them enough to BE good citizens and consumers in this CONSUMER DRIVEN economy.

We are creating a SYSTEMIC problem in this society and aren't even talking about it realistically

Every time this issue comes up, people dismiss it by proposing that people just need more education.

But as I have already point out, even EDUCATED people are being effected by this problem, because techological advances in THINKING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS are making even well educated people REDUNDANT.

It's time to START thinking about how we deal with a problem that is now manifesting and threatening not just the stupid and skilless, but the well educated and highly skilled workers, too.

This problem will not go away because techological advances are taking jobs from people such that there is no educational path that any worker can take that will INSURE that they won't be reducatant TOMORROW.

Many software programmers are just now beginning to feel that pinch.

I can assure you that sooner or later most people who depend on working (be it with their hands or with their heads) for their rice bowls are going to become redundant.

The ONLY socultion to this is a radical RETHINK of the social contract.

Market forces do NOT have a solution for this problem, folks.

Why not?

Because our economic system is based on a theory of SCARCITY AND WANT.

But techology is creating a system of PLENTY produced by less and less workers.

Unhappily, one needs to be linked into that economy system with economically viable employment to garner the income to take advantage of it.

But as the PROFITS go only to the CAPITALISTS, the working classes grow poorer and poorer until the economy we have in place no longer SERVES the people in it.

Right now I'd say about 20% of the population of all workers are basically REPLACEABLE by machines.

In ten years? Add some more percent of the workforces to that problem

In twenty years, most of you who are feeling so sanguine because you currently have marketable skills?

You're hosed, too.

And believe me when I tell you that very few of your will have the resources or even the mental acuity to retrain for a job that you can do better or more cheaply than a thinking machine.

 

I don't mean to be rude, but when every sentence is a new line it is hard to read. And if you don't agree with what I said...then you can't really be for technology, because you believe it will ultimately result in net unemployment.

What do you mean that is not what is happening? Again, I don't see massive unemployment correlating with modern technological advances. Current unemployment is not caused by technology. Again, people will not be perpetually unemployed. You keep forgetting that people have to be hired to build and design the machines. And if goods are cheaper to produce/cheaper to buy because of technology, people will have more money to spend or invest on everything else. Even if you have an ecnomy where all production is done by machines, and there are only a few workers working at one time, standards of living would still be higher. Because of the massive increase in supply due to cheap production, goods would be ridiculously cheap. Maybe a day's wage in such a future could cover a year's worth of expenses. The point of technology is to reduce the amount of work we have to do ourselves. Again, that is why children no longer have to work. Unemployment is not necessarily a bad thing if people do not need to constantly work to support themselves.

Either way, we are not at that point right now. There is still no net job loss caused by technology, and job restructuring. Most of what you say is just dramatic rhetoric.

 
In the beginning of THIS CENTURY we're seeing advancing technology replacing formerly highly skilled workers.

 

Such as? And do you have proof those workers are now unemployable as you claim?

Here are your logical fallacies:
1. To have a strong economy with high standards of living, everyone must be employed. (this is not true. The whole purpose of economic expansion is ultimately to work less and enjoy life more. Would we all be better off working 24/7?)
2. Machines create a class of people that cannot be employed. (Really? Because I am not seeing that at all...)
3. Increased production lowers the standard of living. (before you say strawman, reread your argument. Technology increases production. That is a fact. But then you say it creates unemployment, and lower standard of living. You ignore the rise in standard of living that cheaper products and a growing economy bring, and are thus implying that with increased production we are worse off. It is labor saving machinery and cost reducing methods that allow for increased production to occur).

And what technological advances of the 21st century are you even talking about that destroy jobs unlike any other past advances? It has only been 10 years, after all.

Luddites will be Luddites. Throughout history, people have been trying to blame technology for unemployment and economic problems, predicting doomsday in the future. And time and time again they are proven wrong. Yet people still arise with the same technophobic arguments, only they try to say somehow this time it is "different" for some concocted reason. You new reason is that there is somehow no new work in the economy, as if work is limited, and machines are taking away jobs as if the economy is a zero sum game. That is not how it works.

In 30 years, there will not be any more involuntary unemployment caused by technology than there has been in the past. But I guarantee that then the same technophobes will be making more excuses to blame problems on technology.
 
 
Some quotes on technology:

 
The technological improvement in the production of A makes it possible to realize certain projects which could not be executed before because the workers required were employed for the production of A. The reduction of the number of workers in the A industry is caused by the increased demand of these other industries to which the opportunity to expand is offered.

 

 
Seen from the point of view of the consumers and the whole of society, machines appear as instruments that raise the productivity of human effort. They increase supply and make it possible to consume more material goods and to enjoy more leisure.

 

Ultimately, the goal of human society is to work less. Every advance we make is an attempt to make life easier and less of a burden. It is easier to call on a phone than send a letter or run over to a house. It is easier to drive across a state than to run 100 miles. It is easier to produce certain products with machines than with people. Ultimately, a society where we all work less is desireable. Maybe if machines did all the hard labor for us, we could focus on intellect and creativity instead.

The utopia of technophobes is a land where everyone is working hard to produce products that could be produced with less work. The utopia of free marketers is a land where people work less because of technology yet still enjoy higher standards of living. Take your pick.

Very well said. And more time to become educated and invent produce and create and solve more problems. We just need to be making more "things" here at home so people have "jobs" to buy these things.
 
 
 
 YouTube - &#x202a;Obama Blames High Unemployment on the ATM and Automation #atmfacts&#x202c;&rlm; 

 YouTube - &#x202a;Obama claims atms are killing jobs&#x202c;&rlm; 

Are you kidding? Look at all the jobs the machines create: invent, production, program with updates, maintain, market & sell, fill. Look at the money in production time they save us. All versus the 1 teller they "may" replace.
It's just sad that our president is so eager to excuse away his own inept policies that his excuse is just as pathetic as the results of his policies.

 

This really shows how fucking stupid Obama is...

So we lose a bank teller but create numerous manufacturing jobs because those ATM's have to be manufactured. We also create numerous transportation jobs because those ATMs have to be transported, as well as the components that make those ATM's, not to mention more armed guard jobs are created because armed guards fill those machines with CASH which comes from the bank... Who gives the guards the cash?? the tellers, or an individual acting as a "teller."

If anything ATM's are GOOD for the economy - not bad...

Obama is a fucking retard that knows nothing other than "organizing" other retards...
 
 
 
Taken care of?...By whom?
The only responsibility here is for each of us to take care of our selves.
Each of us as individuals have the responsibility to improve our skill sets and make our selves marketable in the job force.
Looks like on Planet Steeplate, companies should be prepared to "make work" for anyone who may be displaced by technology.
What you suggest is lunacy.
One of the main reasons why US industry is lagging behind the rest of the worlds dominant industrial nations is US industries failed to modernize plants. These companies became non competitive in the global marketplace.
And of course we get to the root of your whiny
ant.....Collective bargaining. Look genius, part of the reason why US based industry lags behind is having to cow tow to the unions. Unions made American labor so expensive and so lacking in productivity as compared to the developing industrial nations, companies had no choice but to boot the unions out and modernize facilities.
Do you really think business owners wanted to spend billions collectively to construct new plants in other countries while having to write off huge losses? It takes years to recoup those investments.

 

Bullshit. At this point and time(and it's been that way for quite a while) Unionized workers make up a mere 7% of the workforce. Most of THOSE people are Public Sector employees. Funny how back in the 70's, Unionized workers made up 25% of the workforce and there were plenty of jobs. Funny how the top tax rate was 60% or so and there were plenty of jobs.

No, it wasn't Unions, it wasn't collective bargaining and it wasn't taxation. It was Pure greed... Nothing more. They found the slave labor they wanted and our wonderful legislators provided them the avenue to take advantage of it.

BTW.... Let's dream up a scenario... let's suppose there's a breakthrough in robotics in which it's possible to have machines do just about every task. What happens to PEOPLE then? That day is not all that far away. And No, I am not a technophobe. I just think if Big business keeps sucking the country dry asking for tax breaks, choosing to invest in foreign countries rather than our own, and not giving a damn about the shrinking middle class and the rising number of poverty level people... this country is doomed.

So yes... when the fat cats are making the level of profit that has never been seen before and still choose to sit on what? $2-3 Trillion dollars rather than invest here? Yeah.... I'd say they are fucking traitors, not heroes. Money is leaving this country in droves and it's not coming back.

But people like you would rather blame a crackhead in some slum somewhere than have the courage to look at where our real problems lie and call these "so called" Job Creators out for what they are.

They already do.

One example how a thinking logical machine impacted my business was when PhoptoShop adding editing features using FUZZY LOGIC.

So our ability to clean up images increased enormously, thus eliminating the need for a human being to make that fuzzy logic DECISON nearly one pixel at a time.

An image that might have taken a human an hour to clean is now cleaned using that FUIZZY LOGIC in a FEW SECONDS.

 
If you are right that there are simply not enough new jobs to go around we will see signs of that at some point.

 

We already are.

We have been for sometime, but we've been telling ourselves that the cause of it was something else.

To some extent the service industries have been picking up the slack, but one can see the effect when you look at the pay losses people migrating from formerly skilled work to service jobs.

 
Presently no one, except for a few nutcases, is saying that. Everyone is saying that the current unemployment numbers are just a blip and that the economy will eventually recover.

 

Well I am one of those nutcases, I suppose.

I am saying that automatic is in part responsible for entrechned un-and-under-employment and that this problem is getting worse at an accelorating rate, too.

The next few decades I expect that we will start talking about this problem because this is a problem that economic recovery (from this particualr economic meltdown) is NOT going to solve.

Yes yes yes...All of the pro union people look at their demise as pure greed. We've played that tune before and it's really boring. Next.
Ok....your last paragraph is all over the place. It makes no sense. It's a rant.
We're discussing technology and it's effects on labor. You're going off on fat cats, profits and foreign competition....Jesus Christ...I bet you don't use turn signals while driving either.
Where are the "real problems"?
What $2 to $3 trillion dollars? To what do you refer? I have read about this mythical pot of gold US businesses are allegedly "sitting on",but have never seen proof of it's existence.
For a moment, I will stipulate the money exists.
IN your opinion what is the primary function of a business? This question ties directly with profit vs expenses. In particular, labor.
BTW, the middle class continues to expand while each few years the federal bureaucracy in charge of calculating the gross income of the poverty line keeps having to revise that number upward.
Oh, BTW, you still have not addressed the "taken care of "issue.....Wanna give that a whirl?

I guess that depends on how you see the world.

Nixon imposed wage and price freezes, unemployment was higher, there were gas shortages, and we had inflation so bad they invented a term to describe it, stagflation.

By all means, lets us go back to those days.

 
No, it wasn't Unions, it wasn't collective bargaining and it wasn't taxation. It was Pure greed... Nothing more. They found the slave labor they wanted and our wonderful legislators provided them the avenue to take advantage of it.

 

Pure greed moved us from the stagnant economy of the 70s to the vibrant economy of the 90s? If that is true, and I will dispute that, what is your problem with greed?

You should read some science fiction sometime, or just watch Star Trek. They have machines that do everything imaginable, including making food from thin air, yet no one is dying on the streets. That is because, unlike you, they adapted to the changing world and found ways to channel their interests into something they enjoy.

 
So yes... when the fat cats are making the level of profit that has never been seen before and still choose to sit on what? $2-3 Trillion dollars rather than invest here? Yeah.... I'd say they are fucking traitors, not heroes. Money is leaving this country in droves and it's not coming back.

 

Money is nothing but a government imposed means to control trade, why should I care where it is?

 
But people like you would rather blame a crackhead in some slum somewhere than have the courage to look at where our real problems lie and call these "so called" Job Creators out for what they are.

 

I am not blaming anyone for anything, you are. I just enjoy pointing out how absurd your worldview is.

Photoshop does not think, it applies an algorithm developed using millions of man hours of data to clean up images. If that algorithm selects the wrong answer a human still has to come in behind it, undo the work, and fix it. All Photoshop does is save the guy doing the editing the tedium of having to do that with every single picture he is editing.

If you study history you will see that in the early days of the industrial revolution people were saying almost exactly the same thing you are right now, turns out they were wrong. That does not prove you wrong by any means, but it does provide evidence that making predictions of what will happen in the future is an iffy proposition.
 
 
I was just wondering.........Does Obama know that all 57 states have ATMs now?
 
 
 
The President is not wrong. In just two years I've seen automation reduce the personnel size in my office by 30%.

 

Is that 30% as compared to overall sales or 30% ascompared to the level of employment two years ago?
 
 
Obama is just plain stupid about economics.

Liberals always think it's better to have 20 union workers build a car than only 5 with the help of robots, DAMN TECHNOLOGY!

At Wal Mart, they should hire 10-15 sloths to work the checkout lines instead of self-checkout machines that help speed up the checkout process is the mentality of liberals. We should be forced to stand in lines at the bank to get our money, that damn ATM is just too convenient.

If liberals were able to control every part of our lives, we would eventually de-evolve back to sticks and stone cavemen.

I got rid of my fridge and bought a true "icebox". It's awesome, I hitch up the wagon and me and the mules head over to the ice house, then stop at the General Store on the way back to load up on whale oil for the lanterns. It's a nice day trip.

Exactly. The same technophobic arguments are put forth again and again, and supporters of such arguments always try to claim "this time it is different."

Let me quote Einstein

 
Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

Obama's father was an African socialist and his mother a left-wing mystic, so he didn't fall far from the family tree despite his grandparents being sort of middle of the road white people.

He then got influenced even more through his college years at Columbia and Harvard by the leftist views that are anti-capitalist and pro-community socialist model morons.

His work as a community organizer and law professor prior to running for political office in Illinois shows he has ZERO experience in the business world. He is a product of bad parents, biased schools and leftist jobs....

 
 
Obama is just plain stupid about economics.

Liberals always think it's better to have 20 union workers build a car than only 5 with the help of robots, DAMN TECHNOLOGY!

At Wal Mart, they should hire 10-15 sloths to work the checkout lines instead of self-checkout machines that help speed up the checkout process is the mentality of liberals. We should be forced to stand in lines at the bank to get our money, that damn ATM is just too convenient.

If liberals were able to control every part of our lives, we would eventually de-evolve back to sticks and stone cavemen.

 

What did you expect? He's lived on the dole his entire life.

 
 
 
 
Slave labor?  
Yes yes yes...All of the pro union people look at their demise as pure greed. We've played that tune before and it's really boring. Next.
Ok....your last paragraph is all over the place. It makes no sense. It's a rant.
We're discussing technology and it's effects on labor. You're going off on fat cats, profits and foreign competition....Jesus Christ...I bet you don't use turn signals while driving either.
Where are the "real problems"?
What $2 to $3 trillion dollars? To what do you refer? I have read about this mythical pot of gold US businesses are allegedly "sitting on",but have never seen proof of it's existence.
For a moment, I will stipulate the money exists.
IN your opinion what is the primary function of a business? This question ties directly with profit vs expenses. In particular, labor.
BTW, the middle class continues to expand while each few years the federal bureaucracy in charge of calculating the gross income of the poverty line keeps having to revise that number upward.
Oh, BTW, you still have not addressed the "taken care of "issue.....Wanna give that a whirl?

 

Yeah.... slave labor. When you hire Chinese people who have been slopping around in rice paddies for centuries for $1/hr to avoid paying a decent wage here in America... that is slave labor. Or Mexicans at $1.25.... or Indians for whatever they make. Funny how they subsidize their "cost of doing business" but they feel no empathy to American Citizens who have to live in a country where the cost of living is 100X more than in any of the countries they choose to employ. In fact, in China.... they are selling their own futures(and ours as a country) for that same slave labor. From what I've read, they have to share their own intellectual property to the Chinese government in order for them to do business there.

What is the Primary function of a business? To make money. However, the real function of a business is not to make money at the expense of their home country that ALLOWS them to make the level of profit that they do. Where is the sense of Citizenry? Corporations want to be treated as "people" but they don't want to play by the same ethical rules that everyday people do....do they?

The $2-3 TRILLION that they are sitting on is a fact. The only object of dispute is why they aren't investing it in this country. They say.... "they are scared to" because of taxes and whatnot... I, and many others say... They are choosing NOT TO... because they want an administration that will suck their collective dicks all day long... In short, the cost of stagnation is worth it to them for now. No matter who is president come 2012, you will see a difference in their purse strings... they can't hold out forever. If it's Obama... they will loosen their grip on that money... if it's someone else... they will do the same. They know that if you are standing still, you are falling behind. This is their power play. I hope they fail and realize that the will of THE PEOPLE holds more power than their Capital assets.

Then perhaps, we will see a Corporate Community that is realistic in their goals and not trying to maximize their share while minimizing labor's share. Don't get me wrong.... IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM... am I(or anyone but the MOST Radical lefties) calling for equal pay with CEO's or anything like that. But damn it, people need to keep a decent roof over their heads... people need to feed their families and keep them clothed keep them safe.

IF all that I would like to see were to happen... the rich would still be very rich... maybe not obscenely rich... but they would be able to do just about anything they would want to do... but the people that are slaving away to make them money would be a little better off. And that's all most of us want. We don't want to be "Given something for nothing". We don't want to "start at the top", we don't want government to take care of our every whim.

That is the bullshit talking points of the extreme right that is bought and paid for by the same people that is making all the money. They want you to vote against your own self interest and for them.

Finally... Taken Care of.... you asked for it... you got it. First off, you have to recognize the scenario in which I was speaking. The Scenario was that robotics and automation took care of the vast majority of jobs and chores in a business setting. That would lead to a huge amount of people who were not NEEDED for much of any job that is available now. OF course, in other countries... it still may be more cost effective to use the aforementioned "slave labor" than it would be to use machines. In that Scenario... Being "taken care of" would mean housing, Food, Clothing and Health Care. Make no mistake... if you watch the Science Channel at all, or read Technology oriented media... we are not all that far away from that very scenario... 20-30 years perhaps. It's already been happened in Japan since 2001, and CNC Machining in America does it now. They need very little human interaction. As Technology evolves, you will see more and more of it.

At this point in time... Health Care would be a great place to start with the being "taken Care of" thing. Our system is bloated, way too expensive and is working on a rather dumb platform... Fee for service. Fee for service means that doctors and hospitals can sneak in tests and procedures that aren't necessary to pad their payouts. A Fee For OUTCOME platform is that the least expensive procedure necessary to provide a positive outcome is the norm. Why should one get a Chest Xray for a common Cold or the Flu? Both of those diseases will run it's course. If it lingers beyond a reasonable time frame... THEN you go on antibiotics in case it's bacterial. IF it still is persistent... THEN you get a sputum culture and a Chest Xray. Our whole Medical infrastructure is based on profit and a sense of co-dependency between Pharmaceutical companies(Drugs), Med Tech Companies(tests and procedures) and doctors.

My solution is to make Hospitals and Doctors Non-Profit. They will still get their money and live better than most... but they will NOT be allowed to gouge the population. Likewise, Med/Tech and Big Pharma will have to fall in line.

I know, I know... what about INNOVATION????? I'll tell you what happens to innovation. When huge profits aren't the motivation anymore... Innovation will come from sharing information with the rest of the world and they can work on new drugs and products.... TOGETHER! After all... isn't that what Medical science is all about? Saving peoples' lives? Not just those lives who can afford to pay... but all lives?
 
 
Considering you libs hate topics that put the messiah in a poor light im amazed that you have kept this thread alive as much as everyone else. I guess the old saying the truth hurts has some basis to it eh?
 
 
Nice easy retort that carries no substance Grampa.... Keep up the good work.

Obama was correct in what he said....only conservatives don't get it
 
 
No need to add anymore substance. Obamas words give all the substance we need, so thank you. Keep up the good work of keeping a thread you believe to be false bumped!

What the fuck do rural and ancient cultures such as Chinese people who live off their land have to do with anything?
Wages are not the same everywhere. So the way you see it is there should be some bureaucratic authority that mandates all wages be forced upward in ALL nations?
You should have stopped at "to make money". The rest of your answer is crap.
In the context of this discussion, China is irrelevant. If you want to discuss China and it's abuses of environment and labor, please feel free to open another thread.
Then you can post factual links that not only explain this alleged two or three trillion of "squat" money but why( facts only no editorial opinions) businesses might be stashing cash.
Medical care is not fee for service. Insurance pays for the majority of health care here.
Very expensive insurance.
If we all paid out of pocket for regular doctor visits, our hang nails and other simple maladies, we could all but eliminate the most expensive part of health insurance, first dollar coverage. Unfortunately the majority of Americans have been led to believe that ALL medical services should be free of out of pocket expense.
If we could buy health insurance across state lines in a competitive marketplace insurance would be much less expensive. If we could buy high deductible policies for major issues and learn to go to the doctor's office with checkbook in hand, our healthcare would be much less expensive.
I can remember when I had to get a physical for High School sports, I was working. I paid the doctor myself....1977...The cost? $30 cash on the barrel. Why? Back then the insurance we had took care of real needs. Not every little sniffle.
We should all be educated on the fact that before we go to the government for our every need, we have the responsibility to take care of our selves FIRST.
This idea that the taxpayers should be on the hook for womb to tomb care and security is incompatible with our freedom, liberty and way of life.
If you want government to pet you, tuck you in at night, free you of all disappointment and tell you everything is ok because you are no longer responsible for yourself, please find a suitable country outside the US. This is not the place for social safety nets and irresponsibility.
Look, you have this lefty rage against the machine thing going on in your head
You view anyone and anything that has places value on freedom, success, hard work, responsibility, taking care of priorities and living within one's means as evil.
You view freedom and liberty as a means to do what you want, demanding anything you wish, do anything you wish without having to suffer the consequences of your actions
and obey no rules. Fine. You go ahead and think that way.
Just remember....It's not about being right. It's about doing right.
We're through. You will now feel compelled to have the last word.
 
 
 
No need to add anymore substance. Obamas words give all the substance we need, so thank you. Keep up the good work of keeping a thread you believe to be false bumped!

 

When asked by Ann Curry why Industry had invested only 2% in new jobs while they invested 26% in new technologies, Obama replied:

"The other thing that happened though, this goes to the point you were just making, is there are some structural issues with our economy where a lot of businesses have learned to become much more efficient with a lot fewer workers," President Obama said about unemployment in an interview with NBC's Ann Curry.

"If you see it when you go to a bank you use the ATM, you don't go to a bank teller. Or you go to the airport and you use a kiosk instead of checking in at the gate," he said.

 US Businesses sitting on trillions of dollars - Google Search 

Right there is a simple Google search... Why don't you TRY USING IT!!!!

Don't give me the freedom, hard work bullshit. I work just as hard as you on a weekend day as you do during the week. I do recognize the "consequences of my actions"... oh wait... that's right... your an unintelligent twit who likes to espouse the "truth" according to Glenn Beck.

I work with the Developmentally disabled... (READ: Mentally Retarded, for those of you with a lack of understanding, OR COMPASSION) I do right... every god damned day I go to work and have been doing so for 22 Years of my life. What the fuck have you done? Who have YOU helped? And no... it's not just about "collecting a paycheck". It's about helping people who desperately NEED it.

Furthermore... I donate my time, money and material possessions to a local homeless shelter(Haven Ministries... look it up). I also donate time to the AMERICAN RED CROSS and HABITAT FOR HUMANITY.

Why don't you assholes grow the fuck up and realize that Volunteerism is a choice that doesn't NEARLY go far enough? You think it's because your taxes are too high on your 20-50K job? Fucking absurd. The problem is that the extremely wealthy have been allowed to dictate their own god damned policies for the last 30 years.

But I know.. you refuse to see anything beyond the scope of your own comfort level. You find it easier to assume that the GOD DAMNED liberal of this country are causing all the problems.. when in fact, it's the WIN AT ALL COSTS Capitalists who have reigned since I was 16 years old.

Trickle down economics was and is a farce. Thanks Ronnie Reagan... even your namesake son disagrees with your philosophy. Trickle down is the right wing version of Communism... great in theory... sucks in reality.

yeah.... Slave labor. When you hire chinese people who have been slopping around in rice paddies for centuries for $1/hr to avoid paying a decent wage here in america... That is slave labor. Or mexicans at $1.25.... Or indians for whatever they make. Funny how they subsidize their "cost of doing business" but they feel no empathy to american citizens who have to live in a country where the cost of living is 100x more than in any of the countries they choose to employ. In fact, in china.... They are selling their own futures(and ours as a country) for that same slave labor. From what i've read, they have to share their own intellectual property to the chinese government in order for them to do business there.

What is the primary function of a business? To make money. However, the real function of a business is not to make money at the expense of their home country that allows them to make the level of profit that they do. Where is the sense of citizenry? Corporations want to be treated as "people" but they don't want to play by the same ethical rules that everyday people do....do they?

The $2-3 trillion that they are sitting on is a fact. The only object of dispute is why they aren't investing it in this country. They say.... "they are scared to" because of taxes and whatnot... I, and many others say... They are choosing not to... Because they want an administration that will suck their collective dicks all day long... In short, the cost of stagnation is worth it to them for now. No matter who is president come 2012, you will see a difference in their purse strings... They can't hold out forever. If it's obama... They will loosen their grip on that money... If it's someone else... They will do the same. They know that if you are standing still, you are falling behind. This is their power play. I hope they fail and realize that the will of the people holds more power than their capital assets.

Then perhaps, we will see a corporate community that is realistic in their goals and not trying to maximize their share while minimizing labor's share. Don't get me wrong.... In no way, shape, or form... Am i(or anyone but the most radical lefties) calling for equal pay with ceo's or anything like that. But damn it, people need to keep a decent roof over their heads... People need to feed their families and keep them clothed keep them safe.

If all that i would like to see were to happen... The rich would still be very rich... Maybe not obscenely rich... But they would be able to do just about anything they would want to do... But the people that are slaving away to make them money would be a little better off. And that's all most of us want. We don't want to be "given something for nothing". We don't want to "start at the top", we don't want government to take care of our every whim.

That is the bullshit talking points of the extreme right that is bought and paid for by the same people that is making all the money. They want you to vote against your own self interest and for them.

Finally... Taken care of.... You asked for it... You got it. First off, you have to recognize the scenario in which i was speaking. The scenario was that robotics and automation took care of the vast majority of jobs and chores in a business setting. That would lead to a huge amount of people who were not needed for much of any job that is available now. Of course, in other countries... It still may be more cost effective to use the aforementioned "slave labor" than it would be to use machines. In that scenario... Being "taken care of" would mean housing, food, clothing and health care. Make no mistake... If you watch the science channel at all, or read technology oriented media... We are not all that far away from that very scenario... 20-30 years perhaps. It's already been happened in japan since 2001, and cnc machining in america does it now. They need very little human interaction. As technology evolves, you will see more and more of it.

At this point in time... Health care would be a great place to start with the being "taken care of" thing. Our system is bloated, way too expensive and is working on a rather dumb platform... Fee for service. Fee for service means that doctors and hospitals can sneak in tests and procedures that aren't necessary to pad their payouts. A fee for outcome platform is that the least expensive procedure necessary to provide a positive outcome is the norm. Why should one get a chest xray for a common cold or the flu? Both of those diseases will run it's course. If it lingers beyond a reasonable time frame... Then you go on antibiotics in case it's bacterial. If it still is persistent... Then you get a sputum culture and a chest xray. Our whole medical infrastructure is based on profit and a sense of co-dependency between pharmaceutical companies(drugs), med tech companies(tests and procedures) and doctors.

My solution is to make hospitals and doctors non-profit. They will still get their money and live better than most... But they will not be allowed to gouge the population. Likewise, med/tech and big pharma will have to fall in line.

I know, i know... What about innovation????? I'll tell you what happens to innovation. When huge profits aren't the motivation anymore... Innovation will come from sharing information with the rest of the world and they can work on new drugs and products.... Together! After all... Isn't that what medical science is all about? Saving peoples' lives? Not just those lives who can afford to pay... But all lives?

 

what the fuck do rural and ancient cultures such as chinese people who live off their land have to do with anything?
Wages are not the same everywhere. So the way you see it is there should be some bureaucratic authority that mandates all wages be forced upward in all nations?
You should have stopped at "to make money". The rest of your answer is crap.
In the context of this discussion, china is irrelevant. If you want to discuss china and it's abuses of environment and labor, please feel free to open another thread.
Then you can post factual links that not only explain this alleged two or three trillion of "squat" money but why( facts only no editorial opinions) businesses might be stashing cash.
Medical care is not fee for service. Insurance pays for the majority of health care here.
Very expensive insurance.
If we all paid out of pocket for regular doctor visits, our hang nails and other simple maladies, we could all but eliminate the most expensive part of health insurance, first dollar coverage. Unfortunately the majority of americans have been led to believe that all medical services should be free of out of pocket expense.
If we could buy health insurance across state lines in a competitive marketplace insurance would be much less expensive. If we could buy high deductible policies for major issues and learn to go to the doctor's office with checkbook in hand, our healthcare would be much less expensive.
I can remember when i had to get a physical for high school sports, i was working. I paid the doctor myself....1977...the cost? $30 cash on the barrel. Why? Back then the insurance we had took care of real needs. Not every little sniffle.
We should all be educated on the fact that before we go to the government for our every need, we have the responsibility to take care of our selves first.
This idea that the taxpayers should be on the hook for womb to tomb care and security is incompatible with our freedom, liberty and way of life.
If you want government to pet you, tuck you in at night, free you of all disappointment and tell you everything is ok because you are no longer responsible for yourself, please find a suitable country outside the us. This is not the place for social safety nets and irresponsibility.
Look, you have this lefty rage against the machine thing going on in your head
you view anyone and anything that has places value on freedom, success, hard work, responsibility, taking care of priorities and living within one's means as evil.
You view freedom and liberty as a means to do what you want, demanding anything you wish, do anything you wish without having to suffer the consequences of your actions
and obey no rules. Fine. You go ahead and think that way.
Just remember....it's not about being right. It's about doing right.
We're through. You will now feel compelled to have the last word.

 

 us businesses sitting on trillions of dollars - google search 

right there is a simple google search... Why don't you try using it!!!!

Don't give me the freedom, hard work bullshit. I work just as hard as you on a weekend day as you do during the week. I do recognize the "consequences of my actions"... Oh wait... That's right... Your an unintelligent twit who likes to espouse the "truth" according to glenn beck.

I work with the developmentally disabled... (read: Mentally retarded, for those of you with a lack of understanding, or compassion) i do right... Every god damned day i go to work and have been doing so for 22 years of my life. What the fuck have you done? Who have you helped? And no... It's not just about "collecting a paycheck". It's about helping people who desperately need it.

Furthermore... I donate my time, money and material possessions to a local homeless shelter(haven ministries... Look it up). I also donate time to the american red cross and habitat for humanity.

Why don't you assholes grow the fuck up and realize that volunteerism is a choice that doesn't nearly go far enough? You think it's because your taxes are too high on your 20-50k job? Fucking absurd. The problem is that the extremely wealthy have been allowed to dictate their own god damned policies for the last 30 years.

But i know.. You refuse to see anything beyond the scope of your own comfort level. You find it easier to assume that the god damned liberal of this country are causing all the problems.. When in fact, it's the win at all costs capitalists who have reigned since i was 16 years old.

Trickle down economics was and is a farce. Thanks ronnie reagan... Even your namesake son disagrees with your philosophy. Trickle down is the right wing version of communism... Great in theory... Sucks in reality.

 
 
 
Ok... wait a sec Gonebeserk....

Please explain to me what "nt" is? and how it was meant? Just curious.

If you have nothing relevant to dispute or debate, why would you throw that out?
 
 
Nt...nothing, changed my post.

OK... cool.

Sorry. Sometimes I feel liberals are the equivalent of the Israelis on this message board. We are distinctly the minority here. So we are continuously on the lookout from the occasional "scud missile" thrown our way.

I did not mean any disrespect.. by any means.
 
 
 
 
 
Yeah.... slave labor. When you hire Chinese people who have been slopping around in rice paddies for centuries for $1/hr to avoid paying a decent wage here in America... that is slave labor. Or Mexicans at $1.25.... or Indians for whatever they make. Funny how they subsidize their "cost of doing business" but they feel no empathy to American Citizens who have to live in a country where the cost of living is 100X more than in any of the countries they choose to employ. In fact, in China.... they are selling their own futures(and ours as a country) for that same slave labor. From what I've read, they have to share their own intellectual property to the Chinese government in order for them to do business there.

What is the Primary function of a business? To make money. However, the real function of a business is not to make money at the expense of their home country that ALLOWS them to make the level of profit that they do. Where is the sense of Citizenry? Corporations want to be treated as "people" but they don't want to play by the same ethical rules that everyday people do....do they?

The $2-3 TRILLION that they are sitting on is a fact. The only object of dispute is why they aren't investing it in this country. They say.... "they are scared to" because of taxes and whatnot... I, and many others say... They are choosing NOT TO... because they want an administration that will suck their collective dicks all day long... In short, the cost of stagnation is worth it to them for now. No matter who is president come 2012, you will see a difference in their purse strings... they can't hold out forever. If it's Obama... they will loosen their grip on that money... if it's someone else... they will do the same. They know that if you are standing still, you are falling behind. This is their power play. I hope they fail and realize that the will of THE PEOPLE holds more power than their Capital assets.

Then perhaps, we will see a Corporate Community that is realistic in their goals and not trying to maximize their share while minimizing labor's share. Don't get me wrong.... IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM... am I(or anyone but the MOST Radical lefties) calling for equal pay with CEO's or anything like that. But damn it, people need to keep a decent roof over their heads... people need to feed their families and keep them clothed keep them safe.

IF all that I would like to see were to happen... the rich would still be very rich... maybe not obscenely rich... but they would be able to do just about anything they would want to do... but the people that are slaving away to make them money would be a little better off. And that's all most of us want. We don't want to be "Given something for nothing". We don't want to "start at the top", we don't want government to take care of our every whim.

That is the bullshit talking points of the extreme right that is bought and paid for by the same people that is making all the money. They want you to vote against your own self interest and for them.

Finally... Taken Care of.... you asked for it... you got it. First off, you have to recognize the scenario in which I was speaking. The Scenario was that robotics and automation took care of the vast majority of jobs and chores in a business setting. That would lead to a huge amount of people who were not NEEDED for much of any job that is available now. OF course, in other countries... it still may be more cost effective to use the aforementioned "slave labor" than it would be to use machines. In that Scenario... Being "taken care of" would mean housing, Food, Clothing and Health Care. Make no mistake... if you watch the Science Channel at all, or read Technology oriented media... we are not all that far away from that very scenario... 20-30 years perhaps. It's already been happened in Japan since 2001, and CNC Machining in America does it now. They need very little human interaction. As Technology evolves, you will see more and more of it.

At this point in time... Health Care would be a great place to start with the being "taken Care of" thing. Our system is bloated, way too expensive and is working on a rather dumb platform... Fee for service. Fee for service means that doctors and hospitals can sneak in tests and procedures that aren't necessary to pad their payouts. A Fee For OUTCOME platform is that the least expensive procedure necessary to provide a positive outcome is the norm. Why should one get a Chest Xray for a common Cold or the Flu? Both of those diseases will run it's course. If it lingers beyond a reasonable time frame... THEN you go on antibiotics in case it's bacterial. IF it still is persistent...

Glen Beck? Don't watch. Don't listen. Sorry. You lose.
From your article.....When asked why companies are holding back so much, many economists cite broader uncertainty that goes well beyond anything happening in Washington. Firms aren't sure whether the economy can sustain a strong recovery. And as long as consumer spending remains low, there's not much incentive for companies to ramp up.......So, despite the troubling economic outlook companies should just start hiring anyway event though there is high risk? That's it?
Oh...and just because the Washington Post editorial staff says to that reporter "run the story", that makes is true?
You have to do better than that and the plethora of blog links in your Google search.
Look, no one owes anyone a job.
Should a business simply hire people even though that company does not have open positions for those people?
Look pal, I see you had to resort to insults to get your point across.
That means one thing, Your posting of your resume is all bull shit.
Anyone who resorts to hurling insults has run out of ideas. You are out of gas and have lost all credibility. This is typical of liberalism. If you can't win an argument or supply a factual rebuttal, impugn your opposition. I see you've studied the play book well.

Amazing... you are willing to take the "Conglomerate's" word for it, but are cool with "Obama's a kenyan born muslim with Communistic ties" bullshit.

enough of the commentary... Why is Consumer spending low? Riddle me that Batman? Because very few people have decent paying jobs anymore. I am lucky.... at the moment.... I work for the Commonwealth of PA... THat's right, I am a unionized Piece of shit working for your taxpayer dollars(and mine too, don't forget). I make about 35K/year doing unimaginable shit that your weak and judgmental ass could not handle doing.... Cleaning shit off another grown man's ass.... changing diapers off of a person so physically handicapped that they look like a damned pretzel. Taking a literal beating from someone deemed incompetent to withstand legal prosecution and not being allowed the right to defend yourself..... That's right... I am lucky. I take care of those your side is choosing to victimize.... and you have not a single clue who you are rallying against.

Because make no mistake.... I work for the Commonwealth... the DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE... in fact. But do you have any clue who you are hurting with your across the board cuts in services? Let me clue you in on something... it's not the deadbeats taking advantage of the system... it's the people like I WORK WITH!!!! You See, they can't vote and they can't lobby. But the people who you hate so much... they can do both.

Obama's ties to what?!!!! What the fuck are you blabbering about?
It is not consumer spending that is low. It is consumer confidence. People see the price of gas, the rising food prices and they hunker down and slam shut their pocketbooks.
Why? People are not confident in the current administration's handling of domestic policy and the economy.
Why are you telling us about your job? Do you realize you're not phasing anyone?
Your job is a CHOICE....You took the job for the benefits and retirement. That's what every self pity party government employee says.
So really..You can stop bitching about your job. You can also stop crowing how you are the hardest worker on the planet. Because, ya know what, this thread was never about you.
However, you're liberal. And liberals are narcissists.
 
 
 
Obama was correct in what he said....only conservatives don't get it

 

The theories sound good, but when you consider that we've had ATMs since the 1970s, that cannot account for any significant impact on unemployment. If they did, then you'd have to say that Bush did an amazing job with the economy in spite of ATMs and kiosks. It just doesn't pan out.
 
 
No.. you are wrong... It is Consumer spending. When people have to worry about necessities... they don't really give a shit about smartphone technologies.

You are wrong.... face it. I am very far from a narcissist... after all... what is more narcissistic than saying..."why should I have to pay"?

After all... my tax dollars help to pay my own salary... how 'bout yours? If you are a private sector employee... you are beggin for a decent life.... "please Mr. Man... don't outsource my job and make me a ward of the state... or a Greeter at Walmart"/

Seriously.. I've laid my career out in the open for your scrutiny to the general public... what do you do to help our world?

your just like Obama. You got yourself on some kind of pedestal because your a public servant. Your such a saint because of your job? Give me a break. Last time I checked the clergy (community organizers) liked little boys. Your job doesn't dictate your prestiege, its just your job. You chose it, deal with it. A person that brags about their charity or honor has none at all.
 
 
Marx -- a brilliant lunatic -- respected the power of capitalism.

He likened it to a bulldozer.

Meaning:

Whatever stands in the way of profit -- science, truth, justice -- ultimately gets sacrificed to the bottom line.

For example:

If your company is polluting the Hudson River with PCBs, and science proves that it causes cancer -- and people start dying -- than the bulldozer pays an unscrupulous scientist to disprove the link between PCBs and cancer.

Meaning:

When the war is between truth and money... money always wins.

The Republican information machine has placed an entire generation of under-educated Americans in a moron bubble.

Inside the bubble we hear nothing of oil geopolitics.

Ask a moron inside the bubble to describe America's involvement in Iran's politics in the 50's or Reagan's relationship to Hussein, and they stare at you blankly.

What is the National Anthem of Planet Moron?

Mechanization and atomization have not lead to the loss of blue collar jobs.

The bulldozer is powerful.

We are doomed.

You know exactly what I am talking about....

Why did I speak of my job? Because my JOB deals with the people you deem "wastes of space". They can't work, they can't make money for some rich asshole. So you want to cut their services to the bone. Just like in the 80's when Mental patients were kicked out of Institutions across the country because ol' Ronnie decided to lower taxes for his Corporate buddies....Just like the situation is now... just like it's Been since Ronnie.

I took the job because I needed one. I stayed all these years because I love it. Not the pay or the benefits... but the people I work with. It wasn't a pity party... but that's all you can see... black and white.

BTW.... what is more narcissistic than the term "Why should I have to pay for someone else"? That's about as selfish and narcissistic as it gets.

No....This is where you are dead wrong. I support public assistance for those incapable of caring for themselves as well as those who cannot work due to physical or mental incapacities.
Generally the objection to welfare and other social spending is the outright disgusting waste of taxpayer dollars. The bureaucracy, the over employment in those bureaucracies, the incredible waste and of course those who game the system.
Again you take the opportunity to take a shot at those who have succeeded. Your problem.
If you like the people you work with, you have a strange way of showing it.
You people think because we want accountability and an end to wasteful spending we want to end social programs. That's the all or nothing straw man argument you libs use to keep your precious budgets intact.
Just like the rest of us, you people in the public sector will just have to get used to working with less and get used to smaller budgets.
If you don't like it, you are free to join the private sector.

Marx -- a brilliant lunatic -- respected the power of capitalism.

He likened it to a bulldozer.

Meaning:

Whatever stands in the way of profit -- science, truth, justice -- ultimately gets sacrificed to the bottom line.

For example:

If your company is polluting the Hudson River with PCBs, and science proves that it causes cancer -- and people start dying -- than the bulldozer pays an unscrupulous scientist to disprove the link between PCBs and cancer.

Meaning:

When the war is between truth and money... money always wins.

The Republican information machine has placed an entire generation of under-educated Americans in a moron bubble.

Inside the bubble we hear nothing of oil geopolitics.

Ask a moron inside the bubble to describe America's involvement in Iran's politics in the 50's or Reagan's relationship to Hussein, and they stare at you blankly.

What is the National Anthem of Planet Moron?

Mechanization and atomization have not lead to the loss of blue collar jobs.

The bulldozer is powerful.

We are doomed.

 

  None of your arguments have anything to do with technology resulting in job loss.

 

Um yeah..they do.
 
 
 
 
No.. you are wrong... It is Consumer spending. When people have to worry about necessities... they don't really give a shit about smartphone technologies.

You are wrong.... face it. I am very far from a narcissist... after all... what is more narcissistic than saying..."why should I have to pay"?

After all... my tax dollars help to pay my own salary... how 'bout yours? If you are a private sector employee... you are beggin for a decent life.... "please Mr. Man... don't outsource my job and make me a ward of the state... or a Greeter at Walmart"/

Seriously.. I've laid my career out in the open for your scrutiny to the general public... what do you do to help our world?

 

your just like Obama. You got yourself on some kind of pedestal because your a public servant. Your such a saint because of your job? Give me a break. Last time I checked the clergy (community organizers) liked little boys. Your job doesn't dictate your prestiege, its just your job. You chose it, deal with it. A person that brags about their charity or honor has none at all.

 

A pedestal? Gimme a break. Bragging about Charity? No... I just get sick and tired of hearing that I am some deadbeat looking for people to take care of me. I was defending this stupid assertion that anyone who believes in Progressive ideologies is just a leech looking for a handout.
 
 
 
 
 
Obama's ties to what?!!!! What the fuck are you blabbering about?
It is not consumer spending that is low. It is consumer confidence. People see the price of gas, the rising food prices and they hunker down and slam shut their pocketbooks.
Why? People are not confident in the current administration's handling of domestic policy and the economy.
Why are you telling us about your job? Do you realize you're not phasing anyone?
Your job is a CHOICE....You took the job for the benefits and retirement. That's what every self pity party government employee says.
So really..You can stop bitching about your job. You can also stop crowing how you are the hardest worker on the planet. Because, ya know what, this thread was never about you.
However, you're liberal. And liberals are narcissists.

 

You know exactly what I am talking about....

Why did I speak of my job? Because my JOB deals with the people you deem "wastes of space". They can't work, they can't make money for some rich asshole. So you want to cut their services to the bone. Just like in the 80's when Mental patients were kicked out of Institutions across the country because ol' Ronnie decided to lower taxes for his Corporate buddies....Just like the situation is now... just like it's Been since Ronnie.

I took the job because I needed one. I stayed all these years because I love it. Not the pay or the benefits... but the people I work with. It wasn't a pity party... but that's all you can see... black and white.

BTW.... what is more narcissistic than the term "Why should I have to pay for someone else"? That's about as selfish and narcissistic as it gets.

 

No....This is where you are dead wrong. I support public assistance for those incapable of caring for themselves as well as those who cannot work due to physical or mental incapacities.
Generally the objection to welfare and other social spending is the outright disgusting waste of taxpayer dollars. The bureaucracy, the over employment in those bureaucracies, the incredible waste and of course those who game the system.
Again you take the opportunity to take a shot at those who have succeeded. Your problem.
If you like the people you work with, you have a strange way of showing it.
You people think because we want accountability and an end to wasteful spending we want to end social programs. That's the all or nothing straw man argument you libs use to keep your precious budgets intact.
Just like the rest of us, you people in the public sector will just have to get used to working with less and get used to smaller budgets.
If you don't like it, you are free to join the private sector.

 

Reaallly... Who do you think you hurt when you cut welfare, Social Security(in the form of SSI), Medicare, Medicaid? You think you are only hurting the deadbeats? In fact, you are hurting those you "have no problem helping" MORE than the deadbeats... because the deadbeats can vote.

I've seen it first hand. You have too if you live in a city. Many of our homeless population are mentally ill people with no place to go.

This has nothing to do with my job. I have 22+ years in the system. My job is safe... the people who will be hurt will be the People I care for, not me or most of my fellow employees.

Yeah... I take shots at the Corporate and Big banking entities. The whole system is skewed to them and once the achieved a certain level of success... the risk went away, they are untouchable. Which simply shouldn't be.

Kindly point them out, because nothing he said provided any evidence of that. He is saying corporations will push for profit, meaning they will promote mechanization and that will result in job loss. So basically, he is just saying mechanization results in job loss. That is circular logic. The opinion is that mechanization results in job loss, and his evidence of that is that mechanization results in job loss. All he is stating is that the profit-motive encourages companies to purse mechanization. That is not an argument for the results of mechanization.
 
 
The recent spike in unelpoyment is largesly the result of the monetary metldown brought to us by the BANSTERS, not by techology.

In the longer run, however, advances in technology are creating an entrenched and growing class of unemployable, economically unviable citizens..

Adapt or Perish. Many were born to flip hamburgers.

Most schools have about $1 Million in technology, and advanced placement classes.

And if the farmer buys more land because of the tractor and uses the same amount of work, he is not creating more jobs if he bought that land and hired workers to use a plow. Maybe that land was used by another farmer, but the tractor made the other farmer less efficient so he went out of business and lost his job. Technological advances in production always function to reduce the amount of people it takes to do a job. But my argument is that because of the resources it frees up, there will be more jobs everywhere else, so on net balance employment will not decrease and people may simply get jobs somewhere else. Do you agree with that?

 

No, the emboldened sentence is where you're missing the point.

That is NOT what is happening.

Back when the USA was migrating from an agricultural nation to an industrialized nation, the folks coming off the farms could find work in the expanding industrial base.

Additionally, they were qualified to assume those positions because factory work was something most people could do.

But the advances in technology now are NOT creating opportunities for as many workers as those advances are displacing.

And WORSE, the advances in technology are moving UP THE EMPLOYMENTS SKILLS FOODCHAIN, TOO.

We are systenmatically making an increasingly larger percentage of our population (and this IS happening worldwide, too) ECONOMICALLY unviable.

IN the 19th century it was farm laboring jobs that machines and technology eliminated.

In the later half of the 20th century it was industrial and clerical jobs that advances in technology started replacing.

In the beginning of THIS CENTURY we're seeing advancing technology replacing formerly highly skilled workers.

And the number of jobs that are created to service this techological society is a pittance compared to the numbers of jobs that the technology is replacing.

In the last 15 year techology has replaced 6 workers in my tiny tiny operation. While I am able to increase my output my laboring force went down 75%

Multiply my experience by thousands and thousands of small and medium and large businesses, and you discover that we are created an ENTRENCHED SYSTEMIC class of people who are virtually UNEMPLOYABLE.

Now how does that effect every one of us, regardless of how secure we might be in our current billets?

The under and unemployable do NOT pay taxes, they do NOT purchases goods and they do become a drag on society precisely because, while willing to work, there is no job that will pay them enough to BE good citizens and consumers in this CONSUMER DRIVEN economy.

We are creating a SYSTEMIC problem in this society and aren't even talking about it realistically

Every time this issue comes up, people dismiss it by proposing that people just need more education.

But as I have already point out, even EDUCATED people are being effected by this problem, because techological advances in THINKING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS are making even well educated people REDUNDANT.

It's time to START thinking about how we deal with a problem that is now manifesting and threatening not just the stupid and skilless, but the well educated and highly skilled workers, too.

This problem will not go away because techological advances are taking jobs from people such that there is no educational path that any worker can take that will INSURE that they won't be reducatant TOMORROW.

Many software programmers are just now beginning to feel that pinch.

I can assure you that sooner or later most people who depend on working (be it with their hands or with their heads) for their rice bowls are going to become redundant.

The ONLY socultion to this is a radical RETHINK of the social contract.

Market forces do NOT have a solution for this problem, folks.

Why not?

Because our economic system is based on a theory of SCARCITY AND WANT.

But techology is creating a system of PLENTY produced by less and less workers.

Unhappily, one needs to be linked into that economy system with economically viable employment to garner the income to take advantage of it.

But as the PROFITS go only to the CAPITALISTS, the working classes grow poorer and poorer until the economy we have in place no longer SERVES the people in it.

Right now I'd say about 20% of the population of all workers are basically REPLACEABLE by machines.

In ten years? Add some more percent of the workforces to that problem

In twenty years, most of you who are feeling so sanguine because you currently have marketable skills?

You're hosed, too.

And believe me when I tell you that very few of your will have the resources or even the mental acuity to retrain for a job that you can do better or more cheaply than a thinking machine.

 

 
I don't mean to be rude, but when every sentence is a new line it is hard to read.

 

Understood. Some people prefer it to large blacks of text.

 
And if you don't agree with what I said...then you can't really be for technology, because you believe it will ultimately result in net unemployment.

 

Not really. One can be for techological advances and still understand that they have negative consequences on society, too.

 
What do you mean that is not what is happening? Again, I don't see massive unemployment correlating with modern technological advances.

 

The fact that you don't see it proves nothing. When was the last time you talked to a telephone operator to make a long distance call?

My guess is you never have had to do that.

 
Current unemployment is not caused by technology.

 

The currently SPIKE in unemployment is, I agree, not much related to the problem of techology making workers reductant, I agee.

 
Again, people will not be perpetually unemployed. You keep forgetting that people have to be hired to build and design the machines.

 

And apparently you keep forgetting that if that technology costs more to operate and maintain than having a purely human workforce in place, it would NOT be implemented.

Do the math.

Industries make capital investments in techology and machines to replace workers or to insure that their prodcutivity will go up without having to hire new workers.

Either way those capital investments mean less humans are needed to produce goods and services

 
And if goods are cheaper to produce/cheaper to buy because of technology, people will have more money to spend or invest on everything else.

 

Yes, that is true...assuming that the people have jobs to buy these cheaper products.

 
Even if you have an ecnomy where all production is done by machines, and there are only a few workers working at one time, standards of living would still be higher.

 

Really? How will the people with no biable employment improve their standards of living?

WELFARE?

 
Because of the massive increase in supply due to cheap production, goods would be ridiculously cheap.

 

Nothing is cheap if you have NO income.

 
Maybe a day's wage in such a future could cover a year's worth of expenses.

 

Maybe....IF you have a job.

 
The point of technology is to reduce the amount of work we have to do ourselves. Again, that is why children no longer have to work. Unemployment is not necessarily a bad thing if people do not need to constantly work to support themselves.

 

It is a bad thing if you liove in a CAPITALIST society that doesn't need YOUR labor.

 
Either way, we are not at that point right now.

 

We are reaching that point, which was sort of the thing I was pointing out

 
There is still no net job loss caused by technology, and job restructuring.
Most of what you say is just dramatic rhetoric.

 

You keep telling us that, but offer no evidence to support your theory. I can give you the names of six people I let go in the last ten years thanks to improving techology.

 
 
In the beginning of THIS CENTURY we're seeing advancing technology replacing formerly highly skilled workers.

 

Such as? And do you have proof those workers are now unemployable as you claim?

 

Such as the six people I let go due to improving techology in my business.

 
Here are your logical fallacies:
1. To have a strong economy with high standards of living, everyone must be employed. (this is not true. The whole purpose of economic expansion is ultimately to work less and enjoy life more. Would we all be better off working 24/7?)

 

This isn't a logical fallacy.

 
2. Machines create a class of people that cannot be employed. (Really? Because I am not seeing that at all...)

 

The fact that you're not seeing proves exactly nothing.

 
3.

 

I didn't say that

 
(before you say strawman, reread your argument. Technology increases production. That is a fact. But then you say it creates unemployment, and lower standard of living. You ignore the rise in standard of living that cheaper products and a growing economy bring, and are thus implying that with increased production we are worse off. It is labor saving machinery and cost reducing methods that allow for increased production to occur).

 

What I said, was that increasing technology is creating a class of laborers who are economic unviable.

That is not at ALL the same thing as saying:

" Increased production lowers the standard of living."

 
And what technological advances of the 21st century are you even talking about that destroy jobs unlike any other past advances? It has only been 10 years, after all.

 

The techological advances that are making some laborers economically unviable started long before the 21st century.

 
Luddites will be Luddites.

 

I know you think you know what a luddite is. You clearly do not. Try reading the history of what the REAL Luddites were all about.

 
Throughout history, people have been trying to blame technology for unemployment and economic problems, predicting doomsday in the future.

 

Well that is NOT what I am doing

 
And time and time again they are proven wrong. Yet people still arise with the same technophobic arguments, only they try to say somehow this time it is "different" for some concocted reason. You new reason is that there is somehow no new work in the economy, as if work is limited, and machines are taking away jobs as if the economy is a zero sum game. That is not how it works.

 

NO wonder you object to my post. You clearly didn't read it.

 
In 30 years, there will not be any more involuntary unemployment caused by technology than there has been in the past. But I guarantee that then the same technophobes will be making more excuses to blame problems on technology.

 

STop living in a FAITH BASED DREAM WORLD, and start looking at the stats, amigo.

My living is made because of techology, dude.

Your posting to someone who embraced techology probably before you were born.

Nevertheless, the advances in techology are a double edged sword.

They bring us postive effects in some areas, and they cause disruption of the social fabric in other ways.

Negative social consequences, sure. When it comes to economics, technology will always have positive consequences for everyone.

 
The fact that you don't see it proves nothing. When was the last time you talked to a telephone operator to make a long distance call?

My guess is you never have had to do that.

 

Never. Where is your data that all previous phone operators have become permanently unemployed?

My argument is they lose their jobs temporarily as the economy is restructured, but then find new work in industries where demand is allowed to increase.

 
The currently SPIKE in unemployment is, I agree, not much related to the problem of techology making workers reductant, I agee.

 

Egad! Agreement!  

 
And apparently you keep forgetting that if that technology costs more to operate and maintain than having a purely human workforce in place, it would NOT be implemented.

 

Correct, but I am not forgetting that at all. Again you are assuming the labor will not be hired by another industry. And if the machines still use some form of human labor, the company may simply expand production and keep the same amount of workers. In the past, when new technology was implemented, employment in those industries actually increased. Workers were not being replaced, machines were simply added to expand production. Of course that is not always the case, especially in bad economic times when the primary goal is cutting production costs to stay in business, not necessarily expanding production.

 
Do the math.

Industries make capital investments in techology and machines to replace workers or to insure that their prodcutivity will go up without having to hire new workers.

Either way those capital investments mean less humans are needed to produce goods and services

 

Less humans needed in those specific industries. Other industries will hire the newly available workers, especially if those workers have experience. Cheaper production ultimately results in cheaper goods, meaning people have more money to spend in other industries, which is another way of saying demand for all other goods has increased. Increased demand necessitates and increase in production and employment in all other industries. This is what you are forgetting. You are looking at the economy as an aggregate rather than a collection of millions of individual companies and businesses.

 
Yes, that is true...assuming that the people have jobs to buy these cheaper products.

 

Which they will. Even so, if products are cheap enough, it may once again be possible for the wife to stay at home unemployed (although the job of a mom is enough work in itself) and the man works, or vice versa depending on societal/individual preferences. Again, everyone doesn't have to be employed to enjoy a good standard of living. We all desire to work less and still live better. Technology allows this.

 
Really? How will the people with no viable employment improve their standards of living?

WELFARE?

 

It is possible for society to advance in technology so much that a single day's work could pay for a year's worth of life. So people could simply retire at a very early age, or work part time. Ultimately, less people will be needed to work. But that is a good thing. The whole purpose of economic growth is so individuals in society work less but still get more. People worked much harder in the 18th century, but had meager standards of living.

Again, the purpose of an economy is not employment, it is production. Increased production makes employment of everyone at all times unnecessary.

 
Nothing is cheap if you have NO income.

 

I have already refuted that. If it takes less income to produce, the next logical conclusion is that it will take less work to get the same amount of real wages.

 
Maybe....IF you have a job.

 

Is that your only argument? If a day of work can provide for a year, you would only have to work for a few months to support yourself for your entire life, or work one day every year. You are simply splitting the work.

 
It is a bad thing if you liove in a CAPITALIST society that doesn't need YOUR labor.

 

Not really a response to my quote. If you can work less and still earn the same or higher real wages, why on earth would it be a bad thing if everyone worked less? To me that seems great.

 
You keep telling us that, but offer no evidence to support your theory.

 

I am using logic right now, but you only need to look at history to see how technology has not resulted in net unemployment. Again, if that were the case, nearly everyone would be unemployed.

 
I can give you the names of six people I let go in the last ten years thanks to improving techology.

 

And they probably already have or soon will find new jobs. They wont be unemployed forever. Your reduced cost of production will eventually allow for the expansion of other industries.

 
Such as the six people I let go due to improving techology in my business.

 

How on earth does the fact you let them go mean they are unemployable? They can just find another job.

 
This isn't a logical fallacy.

 

Care to explain why? Or are you just going to restate it? Unless your definition of standard of living=every man woman and child working full time. Children no longer have to work as they did in the 19th century. If you still included children in the workforce, yes unemployment would be hirer. But unemployment only includes people who actually want to be employed. When I say technology does not result in net unemployment, I mean that if people end up not in the long term it is because they do not need to. Those that do will find work in the industries that have the increased demand.

Here is a mathematical example. Say each individual in the economy has $100. They spend $30 on food, $30 on toys, and $40 on clothes. However, a new technology has made clothing production much more efficient and cheap. Because of it, people only spend $30 on clothes. They have an extra $10 to spend on food and toys. The workers no longer employed in making clothes will then be hired by food and toy companies. This is because individuals in the economy will have an extra $10 to demand other goods. More demand will encourage an expansion of production in industries that see the demand.

 
The fact that you're not seeing proves exactly nothing.

 

In otherwords, I was asking you to provide evidence.

 
I didn't say that

What I said, was that increasing technology is creating a class of laborers who are economic unviable.

That is not at ALL the same thing as saying:

" Increased production lowers the standard of living."

 

It is not the same, you are right. But in a way you seem to be arguing against production made possible by technology.

 
The techological advances that are making some laborers economically unviable started long before the 21st century.

 

Once again...such as? You are avoiding the question.

 
I know you think you know what a luddite is. You clearly do not. Try reading the history of what the REAL Luddites were all about.

 

Luddites protested against mechanization using similar arguments that you use. That is all I am saying.

 
Well that is NOT what I am doing

 

If that is not what you are doing, then you agree that technology does not cause economic and unemployment problems. Which I highly doubt is the case.

 
NO wonder you object to my post. You clearly didn't read it.

 

I didn't read it yet I quoted every word you said in little sections? BTW, you didn't actually argue why what I said was wrong.

 
STop living in a FAITH BASED DREAM WORLD, and start looking at the stats, amigo.

 

Faith? When did I mention anything about faith? Do you mean reason? Because the two are not the same. If you want to criticize my logic approach, go ahead. All it takes is a look at historical data to see the actual results of technology, but remember statistics mean nothing without analysis and explanations.

 
My living is made because of techology, dude.

Your posting to someone who embraced techology probably before you were born.

Nevertheless, the advances in techology are a double edged sword.

They bring us postive effects in some areas, and they cause disruption of the social fabric in other ways.

Try thinking more subtly than a cheerleader.

Start looking at the WHOLE picture.

 

Pretty much all ad hominem there with no viable argument. Basically, you are saying "I embraced technology before you, and therefore I know more about the effects of technology than you and you are a cheerleader." Pathetic.

Here are some stats for you. In 1760, 7,900 were employed in the production of cotton textiles in England. The cotton spinning machinery was invented in 1760. By 1787, 27 years later, total employment in the industry was 320,000, an increase of 4,400 percent.

Eleanor Roosevelt held the same believe you do about labor saving machinery. In 1945, she wrote: "We have reached the point today where labor saving devices are good only when they do not throw the worker out of his job."

She was saying that this time it was different, and machinery would create job loss, just as you are saying now. But her predictions were not correct then, for as labor saving machinery continued to advance, even more so with computing later in the 20th century, unemployment did not continually increase as she would have thought. There is no correlation. Both data and logic do not support the idea that technology causes unemployment.
 
 
Labor saving devices. I guess I should not have waited this long to inject this.
Labor saving devices (LSD's) allow tasks to be completed in an easier more efficient manner which cuts man hours. IN my business, that allows me to service more customers and thus increase my revenue and it necessitates the need for more workers to handle the additional work load.
I still have just as many hours in a day, I just get to more jobs because my operations are much more efficient.
Technology creates job opportunities.
