A few days after Morgan Stanley reported its first
loss in its 74-year history, the bank announced Friday that its
chief executive, James P. Gorman, would receive $8.11 million in
deferred stock as part of his bonus for 2009.

Gorman will also receive a further deferred cash bonus, which
the bank did not disclose in regulatory filings on Friday. That
deferred cash payment will only be revealed when the bank files its
proxy statement in April.

A person with knowledge of the matter said Gorman would probably
receive $3 million to $5 million in cash, which would be deferred
for three years and could be withheld depending on the bank's
performance. The individual spoke on condition he not be identified
because the compensation issue is confidential.

The deferred stock portion of Gorman's award is valued at Morgan
Stanley's closing share price on Friday but it would be worth
significantly more if Morgan's share price increases.

In the current bonus season, Morgan Stanley is the first of the
big three Wall Street banks -- Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and
Goldman Sachs -- to announce at least some details about what its
chief executive will receive.

The announcement was released at the end of a week when anger
nationwide appears to be mounting again at Wall Street's resurgent
profits and pay. President Barack Obama this week proposed
legislation to limit the scope and size of large financial
institutions and declared that banks nearly brought down the
economy by taking "huge, reckless risks in pursuit of quick
profits and massive bonuses."

By most measures on Wall Street, Gorman's pay award was muted.
In the past, Wall Street bonuses for chief executives have run into
the tens of millions of dollars. Gorman received no bonus in 2008,
when the bank struggled.

In a move to deflect the criticism, Morgan Stanley said that
this year for the first time it was paying its top executives
mostly in stock and deferred cash payments and that it would tie
part of their deferred pay to metrics based on the company's
performance over three years.

Gorman took over as chief executive on Jan. 1. His predecessor,
John J. Mack, had already announced that he was accepting no bonus
for 2009. That was the third consecutive year that Mack had
foregone a bonus, although in 2006 he had received a bonus of $40
million, more in line with Wall Street's tradition of lavish
payouts.

Many on Wall Street are now waiting for Goldman Sachs to
announce the bonus for its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who
has become a lightning rod for criticism over excessive pay.

Blankfein was paid $68 million, a Wall Street record, in 2007.
He did not receive a bonus in 2008. In the light of Goldman's
record year in 2009, his bonus check is expected to be substantial.

In an earlier concession to the public mood, Goldman announced
in December that its top 30 executives -- including Blankfein --
would be paid only in deferred stock, with no cash component.

Details of Blankfein's stock award are expected to emerge as
soon as the Goldman board approves it, probably next week.

In all, Morgan Stanley announced details of the bonuses of six
senior executives.

Colm Keller, who this year became co-head of its institutional
securities division, received $5.1 million in deferred equity, plus
an undisclosed amount in cash. Another executive, Walid A. Chammah,
received around $6.3 million in deferred stock, as well as an
undisclosed cash amount.
