Republican senator-elect Scott Brown won a warm welcome Thursday on his first
visit to the US Senate since his shock victory in the race to succeed the late
Democratic icon Ted Kennedy.

Brown met with a handful of his future colleagues, including top Democratic
allies of President Barack Obama, vowed to quickly study the often arcane Senate
procedures and said he would not vote in lockstep with Republicans.

"I don't owe anybody anything," Brown said as he met with Democratic Senator
John Kerry, also of Massachusetts. "If I see a bill that is good for my state,
I'm going to vote for it, and that's my first priority."

Brown's victory stripped Obama's Democrats of their already fragile 60-vote
supermajority, enabling gleeful Republicans to stall legislation like the
president's top domestic goal, remaking US health care.

Kerry, a longtime friend of Kennedy who had sometimes sharp words for Brown in
the campaign leading up to Tuesday's vote, said he hoped the newest US senator
would be sworn in "as expeditiously as it can happen."

"You have to work across the aisle here to make things happen. Americans don't
just elect Democrats and Republicans, they elect people to be responsible with
the people's business. I look forward to working with Scott," said Kerry.

Brown, who appears set to take the oath next week, first visited Republican
Senator John McCain to thank him for his early support of his long-shot bid for
the seat Kennedy held for nearly half a century.

"Senator Brown represents, I think, the dreams and the hopes and the
frustrations that Americans feel today. And they want the kind of leadership
that the commonwealth of Massachusetts just sent us," said McCain.

Brown said McCain "was one of the first people to actually, you know, look me in
the eye in this very office and say, 'Well, it's a long shot, but I'm with you
if you feel you can win it.'"

Brown, who also met with Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid and
Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, said he would try to keep his sense
of humor and hoped his future colleagues and Obama would as well.

He said he spoke with Reid by telephone late Wednesday and "we had a nice talk,
cracked a few jokes."

"When I spoke to the president, we had a lot of laughs, and I told him he has to
keep his sense of humor because you need to," said Brown. "That's one of the
things that kind of insulates me from a lot of the negativity."
