NATO Secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Wednesday that Bosnia and
Herzegovina would be granted participation in the Membership Action Plan (MAP)
after essential reforms are implemented.

"NATO decided in December at the meeting of Foreign Ministers that Bosnia and
Herzegovina will join MAP once Bosnia and Herzegovina achieves necessary
progress in its reforms efforts," he said, adding "it is now not a question of
'if' Bosnia and Herzegovina will get MAP, it is a question of when Bosnia and
Herzegovina will get it."

Earlier on Wednesday, the chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Nikola Spiric, visited the NATO Headquarters and met with
Rasmussen. Spiric also addressed the North Atlantic Council and invited NATO to
visit Bosnia and Herzegovina later this month.

In a statement following the meeting, NATO said that NATO foreign ministers will
discuss whether to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina participation in the MAP as they
convene in Tallinn on April 22-23.

The statement said that the decision to be taken by NATO foreign ministers would
be based on "an overall assessment of the country's reforms."
