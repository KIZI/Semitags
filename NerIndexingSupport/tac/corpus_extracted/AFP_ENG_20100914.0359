Julia Gillard was sworn in as Australia's prime minister on Tuesday at the head
of a fragile coalition government after elections produced a rare hung
parliament.

"I, Julia Eileen Gillard, do solemnly and sincerely affirm and declare that I
will loyally serve the Commonwealth of Australia in the office of prime
minister," she said.
