Sen. John Ensign's acknowledgment last week of an extramarital affair
with his former chief of staff's wife ends any hope he had of running for
president in 2012 and will probably imperil his bid for a third
term.

While the damage done to Ensign's fellow Nevada Republicans is apparent,
there are other politicians who will gain or lose as a result of his
implosion. The three who immediately jump to mind are Sens. Harry Reid,
D-Nev., David Vitter, R-La., and John Thune, R-S.D.

Reid, the Senate majority leader, is one of the Republicans' top
targets, and polling suggests that Nevada voters are far from enamored of
the Democrat. But Republicans have struggled to find a candidate to run
against him -- former Rep. Jon Porter, R-Nev., has passed on the opportunity,
and few hold out hope that Rep. Dean Heller, R-Nev., will run -- and the
Ensign imbroglio will further distract the state party and hamper its
recruitment efforts. Meanwhile, Reid will continue to stockpile
cash.

Vitter is also up for reelection in 2010 and, despite having been named
as a client of the D.C. Madam in 2007, appears to have put the incident
behind him politically. The Ensign affair is certain to dredge up that
unsavory episode from Vitter's past for the next few weeks -- at the very
least -- as the image of two conservative Republican senators cheating on
their wives is too attractive a story line for many in the news media to
pass up. Vitter's path to a second term will also be complicated by the news
that Rep. Charlie Melancon, D-La., appears ready to run against him in
2010.

For Thune, Ensign's resignation as chairman of the Republican Policy
Committee -- the party's fourth-ranking leadership spot -- gave him a perfect
opening to capitalize on the positive buzz about his potential as a national
party leader. Thune is unopposed for the policy slot and seems to have the
leadership's blessings. Thune is up for reelection in 2010, but given South
Dakota's Republican tilt, plus the more than $4 million he carried in his
campaign account at the end of March and the decided lack of a credible
Democratic opponent, he is likely to be free to focus on building his
national profile over the next 18 months.

The Senate playing field has remained remarkably stable of late. That's
not to say, however, that both parties don't have opportunities remaining to
turn noncompetitive contests into real races over the next few
months.

For Republicans, their best chances to create new competitive races are
in Illinois and Arkansas. In Illinois, the continued problems of Sen. Roland
Burris, D-Ill., and the possibility of a candidacy by moderate Rep. Mark
Kirk, R-Ill., could give Republicans a chance at an upset. In the unlikely
event that Democratic state Attorney General Lisa Madigan decides to run,
however, this seat comes off the table.

In Arkansas, Republicans argue that Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., is
vulnerable, and the strong showing by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the
Razorback State in 2008 (he won 59 percent of the vote) suggests a
conservative electorate. But the GOP field isn't particularly strong, and
while some Republicans have high hopes for wealthy businessman Curtis
Coleman, he remains an unproven commodity.

Democrats' best opportunities to broaden the playing field are in
Louisiana and Texas. In the Pelican State, Vitter's sexual indiscretion
would seem to guarantee a serious Democratic challenge. Texas is a bit more
of a long shot, although the special-election race that will result if Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, resigns to focus on her run for governor
would create an unpredictable dynamic in which Democrats might have a
chance. The party's preferred candidate is Houston Mayor Bill White, but
former state comptroller John Sharp is running as well.

Those races are in the maybe column. Here's a look at five sure things,
ranked in the order of likely party switch in 2010:

5. Ohio (Republican-controlled): The key question in handicapping this
race is whether Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner stays in for the long
haul in her Democratic primary challenge to Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher. Brunner is
the underdog, and if she can't put together a better fundraising performance
in the second quarter than she did in the first three months of the year,
the pressure will rise for her to step aside. Republicans have cleared the
field for former Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and early indications show that
he will be one of the party's stronger candidates in 2010.

4. Missouri (Republican-controlled): Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., finally got
some good news in his Senate bid when Washington University law professor
Thomas Schweich took a pass on the race and endorsed the former House
leader. While former state treasurer Sarah Steelman insists she is
considering the contest, her decision not to formalize an exploratory
committee should be worrisome to her allies. Blunt must put together an
impressive June financial report, with $1 million raised, to consolidate his
position and keep Steelman out.

3. New Hampshire (Republican-controlled): Republicans have reason for
optimism -- finally -- in the open-seat race to replace Sen. Judd Gregg,
R-N.H., with the news that state Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, a rising
star within the party, may be considering a run. (The Fix is told that the
Ayotte rumors are legitimate and that she is genuinely interested in a bid.)
Democrats have united behind Rep. Paul Hodes, D-N.H., and should have the
advantage next fall because of the state's shift away from the GOP during
the last few elections.

2. Connecticut (Democratic-controlled): The best thing going for Sen.
Chris Dodd, D-Conn., is that he and his team of advisers realize how much
trouble he is in. Dodd is already on television -- an odd move for a 30-year
incumbent -- and his aides are making sure that everyone knows how central he
is to President Obama's overhauls of the financial and health-care systems.
Still, Dodd has lots of image rehabilitation to do.

1. Kentucky (Republican-controlled): Conventional wisdom among Senate
Republicans is that, ultimately, Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., won't seek a third
term and will turn the race over to Republican Secretary of State Trey
Grayson. That may be wishful thinking -- at the moment, at least, the
cantankerous senator shows no signs of stepping aside. Bunning's latest
endearing move? Banning a Louisville Courier-Journal reporter from his
weekly conference call with local journalists. Democrats have a terrific
primary on their hands -- a tossup race between Lt. Gov. Dan Mongiardo and
state Attorney General Jack Conway.
