I always seem to find it difficult to pull a girl in a club, this is not because of my looks or anything like that. I have the confidence but for some reason i can never walk up to a random girl and dance with while, while other guys can. How do u guys pull a girl and get the onfidence?

AND girls how do u prefer being pulled by a guy?
 
 
With a piece of rope  

Ah I don't know man, I could do with some tips  
 
 
Just keep an eye out for a girl thats making lots of eye contact with you and if you reckon she's game then move in.
 
 
looks...

it's pathetic because we have no say in our looks

another f****d up system of the world
 
 
Tactic:

Say in the ears of every girl in the room, "don't say anything, just come home with me." You might get rejected 50 times, but I bet you get one yes, and at least it's fast.

Disclaimer: this is just a hypothesis.
 
 
You have too many inhibitions. That's why.

lol. r u sure?
 
 
just dance with them and see how they react. It's not that hard.
 
 
They follow my lead...  
 
 
Buy them a drink and tell them you are Darth Vader.

It's because the human race has saved a few match points in the past.

We don't have much diversity in us, so unfortunately not everyone looks great.

I'm willing to test these and feedback the success rate.
 
 
be gentle and attentive. get in contact via looks etc. and than talk to her. as questions about her and listen to her picking up what she had said. be charming and you will be successful.

But definitely don't whip out the father line.

haha. yeah. I thought the same. nice.  

let´s grab some popcorn and read creative recommendations.

Definitely, alternatively, use the chewbecca tactic. Just roar in a wookie sort of way. You do however, need a significant amount of hair on both your head and your body for this to be successful.

Best of luck to you sir. Keep us posted.
 
 
I've discovered that if you make eye contact with a girl a few times to make sure she's up for it, steadily move closer to her (waiting to see if she obviously moves away/etc - which means rejection and you should probably give up unless she's totally stunning) and then start dancing with her, 9 times out of 10, it results in success of some form   I really don't mind it that difficult, tbh - the biggest barrier is confidence.
 
 
What if you ask them directly if you can snog them in return for giving them £1.00?
 
 
Firstly go to a club which you enjoy the music of. (I don't know if it is possible to dance with a girl to Drum and Bass music. Big Fish Little fish, cardboard box, is that attractive?)

Secondly, be attractive. Doesn't really matter what you look like. Most girls don't even care what colour you are (controversial!). But as long as you are well groomed and clean skin. (Even if you are a scruffy rocker.)

Thirdly, take time to actually dance with the girl and not worry too much if you are going to pull her later on. Don't take yourself too seriously. But don't act like an idiot either. You could hold her hands at this point or put your arm round her waist.

Fourthly, be older than her. This helps.  

Fifthly, don't be too drunk or you'll act like a tool.

Sixtly, find a girl that you actually like rather than trying to pull someone who just looks "easy" because they will see right through you!

Seventhly, have a conversation, swap phone numbers etc. just like normal adults.

There you go. Just some tips. I have more but that will do for now.

I actually had my drink spiked once. I am a guy but I was swapping/sharing drinks with a couple of girls that I know. Next thing I remember I am entering a club, next thing I remember I am staggering around in the streets all cut and bruised, bruised and cut chin and cut knuckles. Possibly I started a fight and got knocked out but I will never know. Fortunately my friends found me!

Don't know what I had but it was pretty bad. It's such a ****ing dirty trick.

I will always remember, it was the same day that Eduardo of Arsenal broke his leg in the premiership.
 
 
 
Hahaha I don't think my girlfriend would be best pleased. I'll get my friend to try it. :P

 

New plan:

"Don't say anything, just come back with us."

But yeah, you're probably right.

You need to charm the chicas try something like "hey babe I am gonna call you California, because you look a state tonight"
 
 
Easy, if you are reasonable looking girls will look at you in club's. Look around and if your eyes meet with one you like your half way. If your on a dance floor ask to dance. It's very easy and by looking around for girls that notice you, your avoiding the humiliating rejection

why don't you just hire a prostitute babe?
 
 
I've heard this works:

Thank you, sir! I should be uploading a few more covers soon (just need to get my damn guitar leads back). Thinking of doing some Mr Big stuff too.

Do you play? And did you see Gilbert live when he was here last year?  
 
 
 
You probably got butt-raped.

 

Thanks for that.

don´t take everything seriously, life is serious enough. you´ll never get out of it alive.  

don´t be so negative. in clubs it is all about looks of course but it is just normal. within a few seconds you decide if whether you lie a person or not from the first glimpse. it´s human nature.
 
 
I have never actually pulled anyone. I tend to get Lorelai'd.

I'm not Brad Pitt or anything, but it's just what happens. Girls can make the first move.
 
 
Be drunk enough to give you confidence if your shy, go up to an attractive girl, if you get good vibes chat for a bit then get with her. If your not getting the vibes move on...simple  .
 
 
 
Thanks for that.

 

You might want to get tested.

When I was single I asked this girl to dance and she said yes and then I didn't know what to do because I'd never danced before.
 
 
 
Actually it's called natural selection lol

 

surely its survival of the fittest rather than natural selection?

 
looks...

what?.....you go after the girls who you find attractive/meet your standards and the girls do the same... this is a club... not some place where you can meet your soul mate solely based on personality... (even then, for a good relationship [presuming this leads to relationships) there still needs to be attraction for it to be more likely to last a longer time)
 
 
Say you've got a Swanson's dinner in the freezer with her name on it.
 
 
LOL honestly, being an outsider of Britain from Canada i'd love to get hit on by anyone from the UK.
Any guy with the hot British accent has me at hello hahahaha

say to them "i'm not trying to impress you, but i'm batman"
but seriously how do you guys get the confidence to do this

I could do that actually. But a prostitute costs €40 (for 20 mins). The OP just wants to pull (which could probably be done for far cheaper - maybe for €2).

I never said I wished to do this - I was just giving him a recommendation.

Perhaps better would be: "I'm not trying to impress you, and I'm batman".

No problem! You had a go at technical difficulties? I do play yes, however not a great deal these day's. I've gone off metal and shreddy sort of guitar a bit. More into slower bluesy stuff like Dave Gilmore nowadays. Still appreciate(because that was once my style)the amount of practise and dedication it take's to get to that level. I tip my hat to you Sir!

 Technical Difficulties . Solo's a bit iffy though. I wonder if that'll happen to me... probably not until I'm satisfied that I can shred fairly well! I'm still practising quite a lot.

You got a link to you playing anything?  

And thanks once again, I appreciate it (especially coming from a fellow Gilbert fan   )!

Technical Difficulties was actually the song that got me into Gilbert/guitar playing properly. Before I tried this song, I thought I was a god because I could play some Metallica stuff...

Edit: solo's actually not as bad as I remember it being. The ascending shred run isn't easy at all...

Sound's pretty bang on to me   It happened to me in a guitar shop, I was playing away merrily at warp speed when another older guy plugged in. His playing was immaculate and the perfect demonstration that speed is everything. Since then I've tried to play similar to how he did. Made a real lasting impression on me.

You just keep doing what your doing, your better than I was aha.

I have no idea how I came to know of Paul Gilbert to be honest.

Thanks! It was a really lucky run, actually. I still sucked at the harmony for the intro parts, and I was having to play them an octave down.

That's awesome. I don't think I've ever had any major turning points in my guitar playing, really. Maybe I will one day.

I can't see myself stopping any time soon! (Even if some of my friends ARE pissed off with Gilbert/shredding...)

I'd love to have hands the size of Gilbert's. Mine are pretty big, and my fingers are pretty long, but Jesus. When I shook his hand it was like being young and shaking my father's hand.

Time to go to Canada...
 
 
Oh well. You need to take a minute and relax, stop all these if's and but's in your head. stop all the negative pictures you have about YOu, and say Yes i can do it. then go and do it.. you may try, but then you will think about it again, do it.. do it.. do it..
those if's and but's would pop up again in your mind.. well delete them, and just do.

eventually you will do it !!! oh and don't think too much about it then.. it will come naturally   you may fail at first, or may not come out as expected, but you will overcome this part of yourself.

eye contat is a good start... ? eh? keep calm, approach don't be so... needy and desperate, approach gently if she feels you, you would know.

That's because you're foreign. Of course it's hot to foreigners.

I'm guessing you're American.
 
 
Bash yourself over the head a few times until you're roughly as intelligent as the average chav, then try.

Or just walk up to the nearest girl and start insulting her until she pounces on you.
 
 
Mate of mine bet a girl £1 that he couldn't touch a girls boob with his hand - with his hand in his pocket. He took his hand out of his pocket and felt her boob, then gave her the quid.

He said it was worth it.

No lol never. I'm a Canadian who applied to university in the UK. I'm hoping i getting in >.< clearing is fkn stressfull
but anyways all in all, i cannot wait to hopefully get accepted and meet british guys yayayay

His appearance is fine but i think he is a bit messed up tbh. Contrary to what you believe most girls don't think its all about looks.Fair enough it is important but it isn't the be all and end all.Stop using being "ugly" as an excuss.Just get out there be confident in who you are and be nice.F**k all that boll**ks about treating them mean.

Eye contact is definitely key bud.Unless your lucky enough to meet a Canadian i guess.Seriously just scope around if you notice a girl giving you the eye on a few occasions give her a smile and if she smiles bk move in and talk to her/dance with her if your on the dance floor. If you think about it mate allot girls in clubs wanna be approached so its not like they are just gonna shoot you down.If they do then just move on who cares plenty more fish an all.

Man if you just talked with them... that merely doesn't mean anything  
 
 
It's pretty easy to be honest, the more you practice, the better you'll get, and rejection is valuable because you can learn from it.

Main thing is to be confident, interesting, non-creepy, non-needy and able to read her reactions well enough to know how it's going and how to move it forward.

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask, I can probably give you a decent answer.

As for the initial walking over thing you mentioned, you need to cultivate a just do it mentality. What's the worst that could happen? There's such a thing as a three second rule. Basically, if you notice a hot girl in the club, either walk over or look away within three seconds. It stops you looking creepy and also doesn't give you time to come up with a list of mental doubts.
 
 
 
Buy them a drink and tell them you are Darth Vader.

 

This. Then when they reject you you can say "I find your lack of faith disturbing."

I always seem to find it difficult to pull a girl in a club, this is not because of my looks or anything like that. I have the confidence but for some reason i can never walk up to a random girl and dance with while, while other guys can. How do u guys pull a girl and get the onfidence?

AND girls how do u prefer being pulled by a guy?

 

Tell them that you can read minds. Then tell them to pick a number between 1 and 100. Guess 47. Repeat for everyone in the club.
You'll get it wrong most times, but when you do get it right  
 
 
 
No lol never. I'm a Canadian who applied to university in the UK. I'm hoping i getting in >.< clearing is fkn stressfull

so you're foreign like I guessed, hence why you like the accent.

but the OP will be clubbing in British clubs which are full of British girls who couldn't give a **** about the accent. British girls do find European and American accents attractive - works on the same principle of why you find British accents attractive.

I’m 12 and what is this?
 
 
Three things:

Confidence - Don't fool yourself if you had enough confidence you'd have no problem approaching, right?
Looks - Can't control if your hot or not.

LAW OF AVERAGE - No every girl is going to say yes, the guy who gets rejected the most is the guy who gets the most girls. Fact.
 
 
I think you should just go up to them and be friendly. I've known some fairly ugly bores who have basically no personality, who have had success this way (I'm sure that plenty of more attractive, interesting people have had success too of course. I'm not being bitter, just noticing).

now the question is ! Do British guy's like the Canadian accent?
or is it like a turn-off?
 
 
 
Pulled 8 girls in one night once and about 35+ since uni has started lol. My mate got into double figures on a different night...unbelievable tekkers

 

Why would you pull so many girls as opposed to 1 or 2 but then taking one of them back to yours.. Pulling that many seems a bit high school.
 
 
"Gosh. So, what is it you do for a living?"
"Well, let's just say you might have seen examples of my work at  www.google.com . Although the typing-speed requirements are, frankly, prohibitive."
 
 
Just dance with them, If they reject you, Not a big deal just tell her to **** off and move on, Keep repeating my cycle until you find a chick.
 
 
 
When I was single I asked this girl to dance and she said yes and then I didn't know what to do because I'd never danced before.

 

Lol what did you actually do at this stage?

now the question is ! Do British guy's like the Canadian accent?

dunno really. at the end of the day, as long as you're good looking, willing to put out and (for a relationship) good personality, no guy is going to care about an accent.

where're ya from?
 
 
Being selective and playing the waiting game doesnt work, unless you are something Really special.
Girls enjoy attention and like to be felt they have attracted someone enough to go up and talk to them - it makes them feel special and gives their ego a boost. The irony of it is the guys that approach them are generally the guys that has tried it on with 50 other girls that night. As someone has said before, if your aim is to hook up with anyone and it doesnt matter what they look like, the scatter-gun approach is the tried and tested method

Yeah but, likelihood is, if you're at a bus, train station, supermarket and especially library, you probably have better things to do

I struggle to make initial contact outside of what I deem to be 'acceptable social conditions' cause I just feel bad for the girl   I'd think how I wouldn't want to be chatted up by some girl when I'm busy studying in the library, or enjoying myself at a movie or whatever.

really? I thought guys would love being surprised by nice women approaching them.

 

Well no, yeah, I'd love it   Not being the one having to do the approaching  

What I meant was, if I were a woman, I could see why they might get annoyed with getting chatted up when all they're trying to do is have a meal or something   People don't go to malls looking for a hook up, whereas there's more of a chance they do in nightclubs and things can move on from there  
 
 
 
When I was single I asked this girl to dance and she said yes and then I didn't know what to do because I'd never danced before.

 

From what I've seen the objective is to move your body around in emulation of someone having a mild epileptic fit while grinding your genital region on her buttocks.
 
 
With legendary chat up lines like:

You must be Jamaican coz Ja-making me crazy,

or,

Is that a ladder in your tights or a stairway to heaven?

How do we like being pulled?? Lol! Umm, with a lasso ofc. Preferably leather...it's a little kinkier that way  .

Umm, I can't speak for any other girl on here but usually, I'd perfer not to know that I'm being pulled. Just be yourself and something might give. If you're desperately trying to "pull" a girl, it shows and that perhaps where you're going wrong.
 
 
 
Well no, yeah, I'd love it   Not being the one having to do the approaching  

What I meant was, if I were a woman, I could see why they might get annoyed with getting chatted up when all they're trying to do is have a meal or something   People don't go to malls looking for a hook up, whereas there's more of a chance they do in nightclubs and things can move on from there  

 

ah. ok. I see. I like situations aside from a club.
 
 
95% of girls in clubs are sluts, simply approaching and talking o them is usually enough. Just make fun out of them and contact/touch them, it's so soul destroying when I hear guys complimenting girls or offering to buy them drinks etc.
 
 
is it me or does this rag smell of chloroform?
 
 
Just get to that stage of drunkenness where you are not embarrassed to just go up and dance with some random. Obviously you don't want to go too far (you don't want to chunder on her). Seriously though, it's just a case of getting over the fear.
 
 
 
ah. ok. I see. I like situations aside from a club.

 

Sometimes i think its better outside clubs.Just like randomly chatting to a pretty girl at the bus stop or supermarket or wherever is fun.Obviously you don't full on crack on to them cus i could c how that might be annoying.But yeah just having a random little conversation and if they are cool as well as hot they generally don't mind and would take it as a complement
 
 
If you can make girls laugh you will go far lad. Just about being funny and never show off or try to look cool becuase that results in you looking like a pleb

I saw that video in a local takeaway last night after I had drunk quite a bit. I thought I was seeing things    
 
 
 
now the question is ! Do British guy's like the Canadian accent?
or is it like a turn-off?

 

No: I love the Canadian accent. Although if your post is representative of Canadian grammar, I may have to pass.
 
 
1) Keep your eyes open - eye contact on more than two occasions is the biggest clue she might be interested
2) Smile - wait for a positive response
3) Offer to buy her a drink
 
 
 
Lol what did you actually do at this stage?

 

Smiled at me and her friends joined us and apparently my mates were cheering loudly from the bar but I didn't hear them or notice (too loud). I awkwardly wobbled around a bit for a while and tried to talk to them but was too loud.
 
 
Girls that go to clubs are not my type.
 
 
Pretend to be rich.

Don't do this - it screams desperate and beta.

Loving the Paul Gilbert cover dude   Hes so horribly underrated....

 

Off-topic (sorry), but have either of you heard any Neal Morse? Paul Gilbert plays (IMO) one of the best solos ever towards the end of one of Neal Morse's 30-minute epics  . (skip to 27 minutes to get straight to the solo...)

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQhqsczPm1M 

EDIT: And my appreciation of such music is why I can't pull girls in clubs.

Maybe. But chicks dig this. I know - I am one. It means we don't need to spend money. Shallow, but true.

I've heard a little, but wow, that's a fantastic solo. It's classic Paul Gilbert - got a lot of his signature licks in there. I might have a bash at figuring that out later on.

And yes, I feel that an appreciation of music like this is a bit debilitating when it comes to women. Unless you can play like that...  

Jesus Christ, this is absolutely amazing. I'm going to get this album. Thank you so much.

Also check out Paul Bielatowicz - he's Neal Morse's live guitarist who taps the fast bits of that solo with all 8 fingers. It's awesome to watch. (skip to 4.40)

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sis4ZU6oz9U&feature=related 

Saw your signature video - impressive! Really wish I could play at your level. I can 7-string sweep pick but apparently that in itself isn't enough to get me laid  
 
 
 
This. Then when they reject you you can say "I find your lack of faith disturbing."

 

"Don't make me destroy you."
 
 
 
Maybe. But chicks dig this. I know - I am one. It means we don't need to spend money. Shallow, but true.

 

Why not just cut out the middle man and become a hooker?

Oh brilliant. Thanks again. Some awesome stuff here. Going to need to check out a lot of his stuff.

Thank you sir! But... if you'd seen me trying to sweep pick, you would know that I'm not that good a guitar player.   I call it Paul Gilbertitis - when you play too much Paul Gilbert and lose the ability to sweep pick. The plus side is that you become a lot better at string skipping.

Nah, I've never really been that good at sweeping. I think the pinnacle of my sweeping achievement was the solo to Leper Messiah by Metallica. I can do the typical Yngwie diminished sweeps too, and a few of the sweeps the Paul did in his Racer X days, but I'm far from being as competent as I should.
 
 
 
Tactic:

Say in the ears of every girl in the room, &quot;don't say anything, just come home with me.&quot; You might get rejected 50 times, but I bet you get one yes, and at least it's fast.

Disclaimer: this is just a hypothesis.

 

Omg, that hedgehog in your sig so cute I could die. I just want to squeeze it's head and rip it's face off... In a healthy way

Worst. Advice. Ever. Not only is it awkward and cheesy, most girls wil say yes for the free drink and then **** off. I have never once bought or offered to buy a girl a drink, and I've had very reasonable success.

Dance, but not creepily. If I saw you having a good time with your friends and then I drink copious amounts I'd be more inclined (well back in the days of my singleness)
 
 
 
I always seem to find it difficult to pull a girl in a club, this is not because of my looks or anything like that. I have the confidence but for some reason i can never walk up to a random girl and dance with while, while other guys can. How do u guys pull a girl and get the onfidence?

AND girls how do u prefer being pulled by a guy?

 

Do you drink much? If you're drunk and in a busy club it should be fairly easy.
Anyway, I hate being pulled (or attempted to be pulled) by guys who are completely drunk with their faces a perfect impression of this   and they maintain eye contact until they hope to kiss.

I see people on here suggest maintaining eye contact   you can do that, just make sure there's no desperate sex face.
Just dance with someone and if she seems keen, you'll probably just naturally make out.

Don't wear a check shirt. Everyone always wears check shirts in the big chart dance music clubs.
 
 
this is going to sound awful, and cheesey, but coming from a girl, the best thing a guy could do is start a conversation about something, and get her to talk at great lengths about something she's interested in that you (probably) don't care about and tell her that her interests are really unique and interesting and so on, pretend to have various reference points on the subject matter etc. ultimately you're just boosting her self esteem and making her think that you're interested in her and not what's in her pants, so it's going to work a whole lot better (in my view) than dancing in a rather suggestive way near her or any of this other crude stuff that people apparently do nowerdays.
 
 
I'd rather sell my soul than offer to buy a girl a drink.
 
 
Idk how people even talk in clubs theyre too loud you have to shout in peoples ears, real smooth.

Yeah i just hate clubs in general really.

because the girls are slags and will pull anyone who makes them feel wanted.

i HATE it when guys come up to me in clubs - when a guy puts his hand on my arse he gets a slap. boys that get pulled in clubs are the cocky ones.

if that's what you really want, then look for a place in the club where all the girls looking for some go and stand. there's always an area like that. pretend confidence. if it helps, drink some more before you try.
 
 
 
I actually had my drink spiked once. I am a guy but I was swapping/sharing drinks with a couple of girls that I know. Next thing I remember I am entering a club, next thing I remember I am staggering around in the streets all cut and bruised, bruised and cut chin and cut knuckles. Possibly I started a fight and got knocked out but I will never know. Fortunately my friends found me!

Don't know what I had but it was pretty bad. It's such a ****ing dirty trick.

I will always remember, it was the same day that Eduardo of Arsenal broke his leg in the premiership.

 

That's a pretty big coincidence. Looks like rohypnol's some strong stuff

Clubs have loud music on you can't hear each other even if you yell due to the alcohol making your hearing worst

oh yeah, why didn't i think of that :/
my complete and utter ignorance to the club scene is starting to show, evidently, i was talking from a more general perspective. i don't know, i think girls that "go clubbing" are a different breed to me, i don't think i would ever have the guts to actually go and "dance" in a club :/
 
 
 
You're going to need a fishing rod, worms (or other forms of bait, personally I recommend this) and a lot of patience.

 

By 'other forms of bait,' you mean money?

I don't like the idea of going up to random girls on the dancefloor and 'trying my luck' unless we've made eye contact a few times, in which case its pretty damn obvious if she'd be ok with me going over. Can't say i've tried it recently though, maybe i should give it a try. I have no desire to behave like the guys you mention (i've seen a fair few acting like that and they even creep me out) but it wouldn't kill me to go over.

I much prefer casually starting a conversation with someone on the side or at the bar, it is so much easier than i thought it would be. Every girl i've done this to has been really friendly, even if it hasn't gone somewhere they've always been nice to me even if they're with a friend. I feel a bit bad for going up to groups of girls though, as if i'm just annoying them. Do they actually mind people doing this if they seem perfectly friendly?

I think this is more appropriate if you actually want to see the girl again and maybe develop things further, as opposed to a ONS/casual sex.

Ideally i'd want to do this, i'll always go down this route in a bar/pub but you can't really have a meaningful conversation in a club. Talk to her for a bit, try to make her laugh and then invite her back down. Not much else you can do. Its really frustrating when you can't hear everything the other person is saying even if you're shouting in each others ears. I suppose there is always the smoking area.
 
 
As a girl there is nothing more annoying than dancing with your friends in a club and to suddenly realise some guy is practically bumming you from behind...you're more likely to pull if you make eye contact with a girl a couple of times and then ask to buy her a drink. It's so bloody unusual these days you're more likely to a snog or more that way.
 
 
 
95% of girls in clubs are sluts, simply approaching and talking o them is usually enough. Just make fun out of them and contact/touch them, it's so soul destroying when I hear guys complimenting girls or offering to buy them drinks etc.

 

I like the way you just said that they're sluts so casually, To be fair, the second they're drunk, it gets much easier to approach them and do something. Have you had those moments when there's a girl eying you and you're thinking, should i go for her since she wants me and spread my seeds, or should i go for someone who's more of a looker?
Although, i'm one of the only guys who doesn't have beer goggles and I think that's just a myth that people use so they can sleep with someone who is under a 7.

i can't get used to the idea of having causal sex to be completely honest, it's never been something i have ever thought of as something i could put myself through, but yeah you're right, that kind of thing would not work in a club per say, but would probably work better in a pub kind of atmosphere.
 
 
 
Tell them that you can read minds. Then tell them to pick a number between 1 and 100. Guess 47. Repeat for everyone in the club.
You'll get it wrong most times, but when you do get it right  

 

On the other hand, guess 42 and you'll get a Douglas Adams fan

You're more right than you realize - if you're near speakers then the best way to speak to someone is to put your arm around them and speak into their ear. It's an excuse to get physically close to someone

ooh yes, indeed. because under normal circumstances doing something as intimate as that would look a little creepy but in a club/other noisy setting, it's perfectly disguised as behaviour that is suitable, genius.  
 
 
a lot of great idea   thanks to everyone!
 
 
 
Don't do this - it screams desperate and beta.

 

This is surprisingly true. The only guy that I ever gave my number to in a club was the one who didn't offer to buy me a drink that night, or offer a cheesy compliment me on how "pretty" I am; unoriginal much  . I actually even commented on this and found it refreshing that he didn't seem to give a toss about much and was just really relaxed and funny. Sense of humour guys: If you have this, women will gobble you up, true story. There are no leagues when you can make a girl laugh.

It might sound bad but it's the right sort of thinking/attitude to have. Girls always post/say stuff like they aren't easy, they aren't into pulling random guys etc but it's complete nonsense. Then you get guys who put girls on a pedestal and think they have to try and win her over by complimenting her, buying drinks, chat up lines or by feigning interest/telling her what they think she wants to hear

Having a mindset where a girl has to impress you not the other way around is far more effective but most guys don't think/act that way. Joking and making fun of a girl is far more effective, I mean I've probably gone too far in the past and totally ridiculed girls before but they've still lapped it up.

  im convinced beer goggles are a sort of unspoken pact. not that I am beyond taking part in the facade.

although you do care slightly less about people's looks when you're drunk.

Ah I love the ones who say that they aren't easy, then the truth comes out that they've banged like 3 guys in one week, true stories. I also think that it's bull**** that most girls will go to a club just to 'have fun.' I realised that if I try to be a 'sweet boy' pulling will never work, the girls in clubs say that they don't wanna have sex with pricks as well although it's a lie because most of them are either pricks or have game, but really you can do anything to a drunk girl that's into you.

Anyway, i'm a uni student so buying drinks isn't really my thing, I've only bought a drink for a random girl once and that's it, because a tequila was a £1 because she helped me find my money that i dropped on the floor and i'm not doing it again since she just had a quick conversation and she was off.

Do you go out with your friends, because then if you have pulled a girl, you have to ditch your friends at some point if you're getting sex from them, or do you just "lose them by accident?"

True, but eitherway, when I can see a girl in a club, I will still have morals and never approach anyone under 8 drunk, and my 8 as drunk might be around 7.5 in reality if beer goggles are actually true, but tbf, most pretty girls are in the 7.5-8 category for me, for me to find a 9-10, they have to be something special, or have a face like a adult movie star tbh.(didn't choose celeb because their face is full of foundation it's ridiculous)

some adult movie stars are munters tbf..... from what i hear  

don't think 'morals' is really the right word there either   surely the 'moral' thing to do would be to make someone rather unattractive feel wanted :P
 
 
eye contact, if we keep eye contact for 3 secs or more they obv like what they see..from there dance say things in her ear etc and dont make the mistake i did recently, go in with a wingman.. some females are jealous and will pull away the friend because they're getting no attention.. get the number too so even if u dont get lucky hopefully she enjoyed your company and can meet up again. just beware of fat friends!! they are the biggest obstacle in the goal you want to score in... you could go in solo (as i usually do as my wingmen are ****) but if you do try it towards the end of the night and make her ditch her friends..

Why can't wingmen be unselfish and talk to the other friend in a normal convo to distract them ffs!! Even for a guy who isn't gleaming with game can talk to a random girl in a convo if they don't have the intention of shagging them.
Fat friends, why don't they just go home and **** themselves off?
 
 
Copy and pasted from another site. So please, this isn't me or what I'll do personally

The ‘No Consequences’ Attitude.

Stop and ask yourself for a second, how would you act (in a club) if you knew there
were absolutely no consequences? How would you walk? What would you say to
women? How would you approach? Would you dance with them, or be afraid to do
so? Would you know how to kiss women? Keep it legal here boys – no fighting or
other bad ju-ju allowed. Just think though, it’s like this: I’m confident. I don’t give a **** about anyone else. I’m in
charge; I take what I want. I Just Don’t Give A ****(tm). I want to stress here, I’m not mean or aggressive in my actions. It’s more like being
proactively assertive. Not being aggressive. Being too aggressive can (and will) make
women not attracted to you (unless they are severely messed up – and good luck with
that). I just went for it. I pushed until I got a reaction. By ‘pushed’ I mean I invaded women’s
space, displayed non-verbal attractive qualities (see below) and kept at it until I got
some kind of reaction. This shows you got *balls*. Women love a man with balls. This is
how to attract women. You gotta go at this with no fear & ride on the seat of your pants. All logical thought
needs to be suspended. Suspend your critical factor. Just go for it. Don’t think about
your actions. At all. It’s huge to just assume the belief that you deserve it, and you’re just gonna go ahead
and take it. This is incredibly attractive to women. And it is awesome when you do this,
you feel like the master of your own destiny. Great feeling. Bit of detail (some techniques) – How To Kiss Girls In Clubs: Use physical-proximity-aggressive, dominant bodylanguage. Maintain strong Eye Contact. Huge. Imagine like you are challenging her (playfully but
seriously). How would you stare down an opponent in a gunfight-at-high-noon duel?
That is how to make the initial eye contact. All you need is simple dancing. You need nothing special here. Some guys focus on
learning loads of cool ‘hip-hop’ dance moves. All that is, is a distraction. It’s an excuse. If
you have the right attitude and physical demeanour (ie bodylanguage), then you won’t
need any fancy dance moves. Impressing the girl is not our objective here. Attracting
her is. Stop thinking in terms of ‘how to impress girls’. Being out in a new place helps you get familiar with the ‘No Consequences’ state of
mind, and the more familiar you are with it, the easier it will become to get into this
state in future. This is how to flirt with women in clubs. You just need that state of mind. Playfully
assertive. Most other dating tips websites won’t tell you how crucial it is go be in the
right mental state. Massive key, even when you are talking about how to date women. Your goal should be to be in this state of mind as much as you can when in a club
environment. Soon you will be pulling girls consistently when you are in nightclubs. And for those of you that prefer to stay in, look out soon for a post from me all about
online dating tips and internet dating tips. Got some really advanced stuff to share with
you. Join my list so you don’t miss out.

I realised that if I try to be a 'sweet boy' pulling will never work, the girls in clubs say that they don't wanna have sex with pricks as well although it's a lie because most of them are either pricks or have game, but really you can do anything to a drunk girl that's into you.

Anyway, i'm a uni student so buying drinks isn't really my thing, I've only bought a drink for a random girl once and that's it, because a tequila was a £1 because she helped me find my money that i dropped on the floor and i'm not doing it again since she just had a quick conversation and she was off.

Do you go out with your friends, because then if you have pulled a girl, you have to ditch your friends at some point if you're getting sex from them, or do you just "lose them by accident?"

 

I have a tendency to just lose friends all the time anyway so it's never an issue really. I don't really like the whole wingman thing though, so if I'm wanting to talk to a girl I do try and talk to her alone. I mean I have one mate who basically ruins everything, there's been times where I've been talking to a girl and he comes over and interrupts and then tries to pull her himself, it's ridiculous.

Smoking/outside areas are by far the easiest though, everyone just talks to each other and it's a much more relaxed atmosphere to have a conversation in. It's 10x easier than just dancing near a girl and hoping for eye contact like most people seem to be suggesting.
 
 
 
this is going to sound awful, and cheesey, but coming from a girl, the best thing a guy could do is start a conversation about something, and get her to talk at great lengths about something she's interested in that you (probably) don't care about and tell her that her interests are really unique and interesting and so on, pretend to have various reference points on the subject matter etc. ultimately you're just boosting her self esteem and making her think that you're interested in her and not what's in her pants, so it's going to work a whole lot better (in my view) than dancing in a rather suggestive way near her or any of this other crude stuff that people apparently do nowerdays.

 

Have you ever tried to have a civilised conversation in a club before?
 
 
lowest of the low, hitting on drunk girls.

its easier than the alphabet.
 
 
I was with my friend once when she got chatted up by two twins in a nightclub in Liverpool. They were wearing green rain macs, doing the 'big fish little fish cardboard box' dance in the middle of the dancefloor and were both about fourty. Thing is, they both tried to chat her up which was very awkward for her... I don't understand why they were allowed in a nightclub with green rain macs on. Isn't there a dress code for those sorts of things? It was a decent club too.
 
 
 
Why can't wingmen be unselfish and talk to the other friend in a normal convo to distract them ffs!! Even for a guy who isn't gleaming with game can talk to a random girl in a convo if they don't have the intention of shagging them.
Fat friends, why don't they just go home and **** themselves off?

 

lol jealousy is a female trait.. as for wingmen, just have them talk thats all.. but sometimes you have to do it on your own and hope to the heavens their friends aren't haters

Or the friends are a bit Bi-curious and have a threesome  
 
 
 
Who else reckons this one's a virgin?

 

Ha jokes mate, just got done boning my **** buddy an hour ago, you pleb.
 
 
 
Why would you pull so many girls as opposed to 1 or 2 but then taking one of them back to yours.. Pulling that many seems a bit high school.

 

Its more about the feeling that you can pull any girl.
 
 
 
Ha jokes mate, just got done boning my **** buddy an hour ago, you pleb.

 

Of course you did

Yes it's real and that is the legend himself, Akon.
They have also collaborated with JT, GaGa, T-pain, etc. Can't believe you haven't heard of them.

He actually did it. A few pop stars have done stuff with this group.
