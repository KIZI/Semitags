If Liverpool lose by three goals or more tomorrow, then we'll move
into 5th without even playing.

Which would be nice.

Just having them lose will be good enough for me

Of course we are.  Just look at us reading through the LFC newsgroup
for opportunities to demonstrate how bitter we really are...

I'll take and interesting or exciting game for a change. Sick of the
media beefing up this weekend like its armageddon only for every year
for each of these teams to cancel each other out and end up being lucky
if we get 4 goals between the 4 of them.

Wanting you to lose does not make me bitter. Of course, I want the
teams around us to lose. The big three likewise are looking for the
other two to lose as they are in competition for the title.

Nah, what makes me bitter is that I despise everything about your
filthy club and I'd want you to lose even if you were'nt competing with
us. As far as I am concerned being bitter towards red vermin is a sign
of good judgement

The added bonus of moving up a place is just too much to forget
though.

For wanting our team to improve their leahgue standing by seeing another
team fail?

Why are you in here anyway? Your group is ------> way.

You may well be right. However, I think the LFC MUFC game is one that
may well produce goasl. Liverpool's defence is pretty ropy looking
IMHO.

Not sure TBH. I hate watching them play but I might anyway. On the
other hand, I did come across some Eggshell paint last week that looks
as though it may have some interesting drying properties....
