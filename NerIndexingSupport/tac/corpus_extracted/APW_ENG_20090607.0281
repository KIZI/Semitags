Luke McAlister will join the All Blacks squad in Dunedin on Monday as a replacement for injured center Richard Kahui.

McAlister played flyhalf for the Barbarians in a heavy loss to Australia in Sydney on Saturday and is viewed as a backup for Daniel Carter in that position for the All Blacks.

Kahui is expected to be sidelined for six months after undergoing shoulder surgery, making way for the returning McAlister.

McAlister, a 25-year-old midfielder who has 22 test caps, signed with the New Zealand Rugby Union in April after a two-season stint with British club Sale.

"Luke returns to the All Blacks squad better for the rugby experience in the Northern Hemisphere and will provide us with more backline options," All Blacks coach Graham Henry said in a statement Sunday.

New Zealand opens its international season against France.
