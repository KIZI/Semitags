Not only is this not true, but we should be warning the world about Israel's nukes. Yes, the attempt is to do as was done to Iraq.

Its proven that Iran is enriching Uranium to a higher level than is needed for fuel....

Sure, but they are having major difficulties. The sanctions mean that they are finding it difficult to find working parts of good quality. As a result a significant proportion keep breaking down.

Having said that it will take them about 5-6 years to build a functioning Nuclear Weapon and that, I believe, is a fairly optimistic ( Not really the right word) estimate.

If they want it bad enough they will do it. North Korea managed despite having virtually no economy at all. Israel is not the only country worried about Iran's ambitions. Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others all do not want to see a nuclear Iran.
 
 
Not at all, I've lost count of the number of times Obama has attempted to engage in a rapprochement with IRR, the Islamist Rapist Regime.

The Democrats have historically always sided with the Mullah oligarchy (the Republicans too but they're a bit more covert about it).
 
 
Why is Israel worried about Iranian nukes? Because it can kill thousands of innocent people?

Bit ironic isn't it? Poetic hypocrisy if you ask me.

Lol i rate that!

Iran with nucluar weapons doesn't worry me but Israel having them is a threat and dangerous if you go by their track history of human abuse and international war crimes.

Wow you so thick its unbelievable. Israel is not open about its nuclear weapons nor has it ever used them to threaten any other country or in fact even acknowledged their exsitance.

Iran having nukes will lead to a massive nuclear arms race between all the middle Eastern countries. You really seem to have not even a basic understanding of the politics of the middle east.

I'm so amused lol! Iran is dangerous that what the media and America & Israel wants you to believe. Many countries have nucluar weapons so why can't Iran have it either? Because Israel is scared of Iran and not of the other surrounding countries. America invades countries for example Iraq so it can steal its oil and diamonds etc and ofcourse to have a global military bases. And who control America, Zionist!
Where is the evidence of Iran being a threat??? After the socalled 'nuclear weapons' Iraq supposed to have, do people really believe what America or media says? Come on, switch the TV off and get into the real world!

LOL, you think Israel is a threat because of it's history of human rights abuse but Iran isn't?
 
 
Israel is no Mother Theresa, however, it's certainly the lesser of the two evils.

Real source for the diamond claim. Most oil contracts did not go to US companies so it is hardly theft.

None of the surrounding countries want to see a nuclear Iran as this would upset the balance of power. Just because other countries have nukes is not an excuse to give them out like candy to unstable regimes that excuse their citizens for adultery and arm terrorist groups.

Iraq is not a global military base. All American bases in the middle east will be wiped out n a second by Iranian missiles. The Americans know this and so they would not be able to launch an invasion from any of these countries plus most American troops are being withdrawn from Iraq.

Iran as I said before is enriching uranium to a higher level than is needed for nuclear fuel thats your proof.

But please ignore everything I have said, all of which can be found with a quick google from a million and one sources and contuine to believe your fairy tales.
 
 
The way I see it, Iran only wants nuke's because they are an blantant next target.

Imagine you were sitting in a crowd. Then, a big guy from another school comes up: Knocks out the guy next to you, then the guy on the other side. He makes friends with everyone around you and glares at you demanding to see if you have anything dangerous. Of course you want something to defend yourself.

Iran is no saint country, but there is a great deal of countries which are far worse. Say what you want about iran having restricted freedom of speech; but countries which are far worse get no mention at all.

I hate Israel. They are a dispicable country and have done absoultely nothing to stop their constant war crimes, the raping, the pillaging, the threatening and obviously have no intention of peacefull existance.

Can you honestly say that Iran wants nukes to go around attacking other countries, when it KNOWS that it will just be wiped off the map if it does? Do you think the leaders of Iran are crazed maniacs who just want to kill loads of people even though it means dying themselves? No, of course not. They are looking out for themseleves, and their (albeit corrupt) country.

But Iran is going to continually be bashed for wanting nukes, while israel (which already has nukes) will continue commiting war crimes and killing innocent people unopposed.
 
 
nukezrbad, kay.

As it stands, with a nuclear Iran and Israel possessing nukes, we have a MAD situation. Meaning, it is highly unlikely anything will happen..

Everyone needs to calm down, basically.

I completely despise the Israeli government but they're hardly a nuclear threat. Yes, they have destroyed their neighbour, but it's a big leap to think they're likely to use their nuclear weapons - if they ever do it would probably be against Iran as self-defence (stupidly disproportionate no doubt, but for defensive not offensive reasons).
 
 
 
Wrong. If Iran is not dangerous why is there no freedom of speech or press? What are they scared of? Many of those countries aren't a risk. They're very sensible. If Iran was a stable state then, sure it would be hypocritical not to let them have nuclear weapons, but they aren't. They're like North Korea and no one wants them to have it but, alas they have. Israel isn't the only country scared of Iran. Saudi Arabia is that's why America had to provide them weapons and defence systems. Zionist don't control America. Objectively research Iran and look at what you find.

 

Have you been to Iran by any chance?

lol at the negs. you are making an assumption on somewhere that you have never been to. what is the difference between the propaganda that they spread against us and the propaganda our media spreads about them?

I agree, it's so ****ing disgusting that Israel wants to protect the lives of her citizens.
In fact, I'm going to go organise a boycott right now until they stop protecting innocent civilians who happen to belong to a different religion from mine!

Sure maybe if you are dealing with two fairly stable countries but Israel is known to strike out at anything it deems as a thread and Iran would happily destory the world as they seem to think the only good planet is an Islamic one

LONDON — I had breakfast last month in New York with the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Other journalists had lunch or dinner. Ahmadinejad’s passion for the hidden Imam, whose imminent return he expects, is matched only by his passion for Western media.

At the time I chose not to write about the meeting. I was too disgusted — by the media merry-go-round, by more incendiary provocations from Ahmadinejad, and by the sterility of an Iran debate that turns in the tight circle formed by fear-mongering, ignorance and the ghastly stew of Western carrots and sticks.

Ahmadinejad is a one-trick pony. His thing is double standards. Ask about the Iranian nuclear program, he’ll retort with Israel’s undeclared nuclear arsenal. Ask about Iran’s economic difficulties, he’ll see you with September 2008. Ask about rampant capital punishment, he’ll raise you a Texas. Ask about Iranian lying, he’ll counter with human rights and Abu Ghraib.

Not surprisingly, in Fareed Zakaria’s “post-American world,” he has an audience. He’s adept enough, with a touch of Tony Curtis in “The Boston Strangler,” switching personalities with eerie ease.

Throw in some headline-grabbing lunacy — 9/11 as self-inflicted, or the Holocaust as invention, or “Iran is the freest country in the world” — and you have a post-modern media star and villain.

And what do all his words amount to? I’d say not a whole lot beyond unnecessary misery for 71 million isolated Iranians. This guy is all hat and no cattle.

Ahmadinejad is odious but I don’t think he’s dangerous. Some people do of course find him dangerous, especially in the Israel he gratuitously insults and threatens, and yet others — many more I’d say — find it convenient to find him dangerous.

The Iranian president is into his sixth year in office, the Islamic Republic is more divided than ever, Iranian youth have been brutalized, and there’s a nuclear program that, a bit like the Middle East “peace process,” goes on and on and on, defying definition even as it defies termination.

I read with interest in a recent piece by my colleagues John Markoff and David Sanger that “in the past year Israeli estimates of when Iran will have a nuclear weapon had been extended to 2014.” Given that various Israeli leaders have predicted that Iran would have a bomb in 1999 or 2004 or just about every year since 2005, that’s a decade and a half of the non-appearing wolf at the door.

Sure, such predications are necessarily haphazard, the Natanz centrifuges may now be Stuxnetted by computer worms, and Iranian scientists have resembled Iranian pistachios: up for sale. Still there is a dangerous pattern here of Israeli and U.S. alarmism.

Cool heads are needed. Untenable Nazi allusions, rampant in the case of Iran, demean victims of the Holocaust and lead to disastrous wars. A bloody war has been fought in Iran’s western neighbor. So let’s recall that Saddam Hussein told his captors he had cultivated nuclear ambiguity as a deterrent even though his program was precisely zilch.

And what of Iran’s program? Iran remains a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors are at Natanz; the number of centrifuges being used to make low-enriched uranium (far from weapons grade) has dropped 23 percent since May 2009 and production has stagnated; U.S. intelligence agencies hold that Iran has not made the decision to build a bomb; any “breakout” decision would be advertised because the I.A.E.A. would be thrown out; the time from “breakout” to deliverable weapon is significant.

I’m with Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who this year told the Washington Post: “Iran will muddle along building its stockpile but never making a nuclear bomb because it knows that crossing that line would provoke an immediate military attack.” The Islamic Republic is a study in muddle but lucid over a single goal: self-preservation.

So there’s time. Yet the foreboding industry is in overdrive, with Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic declaring that the Obama administration “knows it is a near-certainty that Israel will act against Iran soon if nothing or no one else stops the nuclear program” and setting “a better than 50 percent chance” Israel will strike by next July.

Michael Oren, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, used Yom Kippur to deliver a speech of ominous prophecy in synagogues, warning of the fateful choices presented Israel by “a radical, genocidal Iran.” (Oren had less to say — and most of that dismissive — about direct Israeli-Palestinian peace talks inaugurated two weeks earlier with White House pomp and now already on hold.)

Yes, Ahmadinejad is the bogeyman from Central Casting. One of the things there’s time for, if you’re not playing games with the Iran specter, is a serious push for an Israeli-Palestinian breakthrough that would further undermine the Iranian president.

I don’t expect that, however. And here are two more predictions: Obama won’t attack Iran and nor will Israel, not by next July or ever. Iran is a paper tiger, a postmodern threat: It has many uses but a third Western war against a Muslim country is a bridge too far.

That proves nothing ts just one journalists observations and still does not answer any of my points nor anything about the Iraq diamonds.
 
 
At the very most Iran would have Nuclear weapons as a defence mechanism.
They would never strike first. They would be obliterated in seconds ffs.
Iran's rubbish leaders want to retain wealth and power. They want to subjugate their people with oppression, and occasionally insult other nations. They don't want to go on a suicide mission.
Nobody is at serious risk from the Iranian regime except their own people.

If Israel wants war with Iran, the issue is between them.

Why should we allow the regime to develop nuclear weapons and allow it to oppress the Iranian people?
 
 
We should all be looking to total nuclear disarmment anyway imo.

To me, that is neither here nor there.
We can't involve ourselves in the business of every nation. The Iranians need to overthrow their own oppressive regime and it is insulting to imply they are somehow incapable or are in desperate need of British/American/Israeli help. As much as they might hate the Iranian regime, one thing you can be sure of is that they will hate foreign invading armies even more. I have faith in the Iranian people that they will deal with those bastards in their own way and in their own time.

It becomes our business when an unstable nation tries to develop weapons that ccan turn cities into ash in seconds.

That's the issue I addressed in my first post. We can completely disagree, that's fine.
But I find it incredibly strange and laughable that people entertain the idea that Iran would ever even consider striking Israel, especially striking first. It's just not going to happen.

Your talking about a regime that does not care about its population and seems to want Islamic domination of the world. They may not use the nukes but whats to stop them giving a weapon to Hamas?
 
 
Everyone knows about Israel's nuclear weapons, but I guess it's like a suspicious bag on a train, everyone sees it but no one's going near it.

Either way, Iran has repeatedly stated that it doesn't want Nuclear Weapons and it's Nuclear programme is peaceful, to me personally, I couldn't care less if Iran attained nuclear weapons, given the threats it faces both regionally and internationally, it's fully logical to acquire them to deter any form of aggression that may threaten its sovereignty.

Iran is enriching Uranium t a higher level than is needed ot make fuel.

Iran does not face any threats nor is an invasion going to come from Iraq and nor is America going to invade for the lulz. Iran's army is to powerful and it would take the US 100k in troops at least to take the country. They are not going to bother unless Iran strikes first end off.
 
 
 
Lol i rate that!

Iran with nucluar weapons doesn't worry me but Israel having them is a threat and dangerous if you go by their track history of human abuse and international war crimes.

 

Possibly the most retarded thing I've ever read.
Oh and learn to spell nuclear.

By the way, did you ever catch that wonderful TV appearance ahmedinijad made in tehran, in which he was claiming that their nuclear program was for peaceful purposes, whilst his supporters chanted "Death to the west, death to america!" in the background?

Not to mention that Iran has helped fund terrorist groups in iraq and afghanistan for some time now. Do you really want nuclear-armed islamist terrorist groups?

The Democrats have historically always sided with the Mullah oligarchy (the Republicans too but they're a bit more covert about it).

 

I don't know why you got negged for that, it is fairly accurate.

During the Iran-Iraq War, the US realized that an Iran that was powerful to counter Iraq was important for the stability of the Persian Gulf - stability in terms of US dominance.

Except of course, this all changed with the invasion of Iraq. However, both Bush and Obama have had major incentives to open discussion with the IRR. Bush wanted to limit the Revolutionary Guard's involvement in Iraq - even though the US is stronger than the Iran military, the proximity of Iran to Iraq makes it very easy for the IRR to mess with Iraq. And Obama just hates war, so he somehow believes that helping a regime as disgusting as the IRR in the hope that they stop building nukes is better than some air strikes and pushing for the Green Revolution...

Of course Israel is right to point out the fact that Iran is pushing for nukes - and now that Obama has lost this election it is looking more likely that he will be more proactive, aggressive against the Regime. Now that it has been confirmed that he has lost much support, he may be forced to strike Iran out of the need to improve his own political standings. Shifting focus from the domestic realm to the international realm may benefit Obama if he can show the American people that he is strong.

Anyway, it is better than the US launches an air war against the IRR's nuclear facilities than Israel...
 
 
 
Your talking about a regime that does not care about its population and seems to want Islamic domination of the world. They may not use the nukes but whats to stop them giving a weapon to Hamas?

 

Iran doesn't care about the population but they sure as hell care about money. Are you seriously suggesting it would waste billions of dollars only to give it to hamas?
 
 
 
Iran is enriching Uranium t a higher level than is needed ot make fuel.

 

The IAEA, the US's national Intelligence committee have come to same conclusion, Iran is not developing nuclear weapons,the rest is alll sabre rattling.

And besides as I said, it doesn't concern me to the least whether Iran has them or not.

 
Iran does not face any threats nor is an invasion going to come from Iraq and nor is America going to invade for the lulz.
 

America and its allies have been pushing for regime change for the past 30 years, whether its from the Iran/Iraq war, the support of anti government elements or provocations such as the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 and more recently the military drills being carried out in the Persian Gulf and at a broader scale, the instability to the region caused by the most recent Iraq War. Moreover, we look to statements such as "tactical strikes not off the table" and most notoriously Hilary Clinton declaring that she will "obliterate" Iran.

It's pretty clear

 
Iran's army is to powerful and it would take the US 100k in troops at least to take the country. They are not going to bother unless Iran strikes first end off.
 

Iran's army is no where near as strong as the United States' or its allies, though indeed they will face a much tougher challenge that they did in Iraq.

I am not sure how you reached the conclusion that Obama hates War. He has continually supported the Afghanistan War since its inception and has advocated expanding the war into Pakistan.

Neither is Obama helping or being conciliatory towards the regime. He has given them a fairly clear choice. You either comply with US policy or you will sanctions placed upon you.

Perhaps the logistical impossibilities of accomplishing such a move.

It is just a completely absurd scenario.

Let us assume that they even get the Bomb to Gaza. How exactly are Hamas going to set the weapon up without anyone noticing? It would take months to build up the necessary infrastructure to fire the weapon.

I wasn't talking about invading a country, I merely suggested that we should 'stop' the regime from acquiring a nuclear weapon; a weapon that could potentially crush a rebellion in a matter of minutes; a weapon that could potentially wipe an entire city from the surface of the earth. Ahmadinejad's 'wiping Israel off the face of the earth' quote may have been misquoted, however, the intention was clearly there. Now, are you seriously suggesting that we allow a bunch of islamofascist, murdering rapists to acquire a nuclear weapon?

I had a small talk discussion with Bob Woodward, and I read Obama's War.

Plus he hasn't supported expanding the war into Pakistan.... The drone plan has been the same as the one under Bush.

Source?

Iran's army is no where near as strong as the United States' or its allies, though indeed they will face a much tougher challenge that they did in Iraq.

 

It would still take a lot of troops no doubt the US would win sure but the cost would be high and a full ground invasion is not something the US wants to do.

You realise they would not have to fire it? Iran would not even have to give them a bomb just the nessecary components needed for a dirty bomb that is practically untraceable and easy to make.

How do you go about that without hurting the population?

 

By imposing a set of rigorous sanctions upon the Iranian regime, crippling its economy and thus, its defence system.

I'm not saying I have all the answers, by any means. But I think it would be an absolute mistake to have a repeat of  this  with the Iranian people and their children.
I don't think any nation really wants to live outside of the International community, and if diplomacy is tried hard enough it can succeed. It's important to see things from their perspective as well.
If we want the Iranian regime gone, we have to support it's people not punish them. In my opinion, this would be the healthiest and most successful way of getting rid of these people. They would see their success as being of their own doing, and as a result that change would have a higher chance of lasting long term, and that is after all, what we should all want for them.

Edit: That wasn't me that negged you btw

Not once in history has freedom been free, people will die, there's no doubt about it. However, sanctions, at least in my opinion, are the are the most effective tool and they should, in theory, keep the death toll low, if a conflict between the regime and the people erupts.

Having said that, I do not envisage, let alone desire, living in a world where a bunch of religious fanatics have a weapon that can erase an entire city from the surface of the earth. The regime will either: comply with the West's wishes or face airstrikes.

I never said it would be blood-free, but if there is going to be violence, the Iranian people should be the ones to choose how this comes about. They are after all, the people who are going to be sacrificed in this.
For any people in the world, least of all people from the Middle East, there is a huge difference between somebody who died as a martyr making lunch for their children in the kitchen, under an American/Israeli imposed airstrike. And somebody who died as a martyr fighting an oppressive leader.
If we go to war with Iran, the Iranian regime may be overthrown, but the fruits of resentment would already be growing between the general Iranian populous and the rest of the world. And where would long term peace be then?
We simply disagree, and we will go around in circles. You will say we should impose sanction and/or airstrikes. I will say we should allow the Iranian people to overthrow their own leaders in order to achieve a stable and peaceful democracy.
 
 
 
I never said it would be blood-free, but if there is going to be violence, the Iranian people should be the ones to choose how this comes about. They are after all, the people who are going to be sacrificed in this.

How do the Iranians overthrow the dictatorship when their necks are being firmly crushed by the Regime's jackboot? We're no longer in the Middle Ages, when peasants could stage uprisings - welcome to the 21st century. You're basically saying, 'the child is hungry, he/she should make his/her own food'. It's naive to think like that, to say the least.

Indeed, they did. However, the Regime has a stronger stranglehold on the Iranians than the Shah did and had he not decided to Westernise Iran, his reign may have been prolonged.

Sanctions must be imposed upon the Regime if the Iranians have any chance of retaking control of their country, you'd be ludicrous to think otherwise.

You do realize that most Iranians like the current regime.
The ones that don't just happen to be the ones with access to foreign media to better their case.

Around and around we go...
 
 
 
nukezrbad, kay.

As it stands, with a nuclear Iran and Israel possessing nukes, we have a MAD situation. Meaning, it is highly unlikely anything will happen..

Everyone needs to calm down, basically.

 

MAD doesnt apply in theocracies, eg. constant weekly suicide bombings in iraq and pakistan...they dont care
 
 
 
We should all be looking to total nuclear disarmment anyway imo.

 

which would result in a nuclear holocaust...

Bull****. There's a huge difference between suicide bombings and MAD.

and last time I checked, Pakistan (a theocracy, in your opinion) possessed nuclear weapons. Is Delhi under a mushroom cloud? Is Mumbai home to 3 headed babies? No.

No because the US was forced to give both Indian and Pakistan most of it's nuclear safety technology and systems in order to keep there being a semi-peace.

no i said there would be a nuclear holocaust if there was DISarmament, its true even though it may seem a paradox at first.
 
 
 
You realise they would not have to fire it? Iran would not even have to give them a bomb just the nessecary components needed for a dirty bomb that is practically untraceable and easy to make.

 

You do not need to be a nuclear power to do that. They could hypothetically do that now.

A Dirty bomb isn't practically untraceable or very effective for that matter.

Its a lot harder to trace than a conventional bomb. They can be very effective in the long term. A dirty bomb would kill 100's in the first explosion then thousands in the months and years following. There is also a profound psychological effect that comes with it that would lead to an entire nation living in fear
 
 
 
I said, not punish the population.

 

The population have been punished for the past 31 years, what planet are you living on?
 
 
 
I had a small talk discussion with Bob Woodward, and I read Obama's War.

 

Name dropping doesn't counter anything I have said.

 
Plus he hasn't supported expanding the war into Pakistan.... The drone plan has been the same as the one under Bush.

 

He clearly supported plans to allow troops to enter Pakistan to pursue Al Qaeda/Taliban. That was not the plan under Bush.

“If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won’t act, we will.”

"We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions"
 
 
 
Its a lot harder to trace than a conventional bomb.

 

No, it isn't. It leaves radioactive markers everywhere.

Remember Litvinenko? They even found the flights which the killer used

No, it wouldn't lead to hundreds dying. It is doubtful that there even would be fatal injuries.

"A dose of 400-500 rem is generally considered lethal to half the exposed population. However, prompt doses—those coming directly from external radioactive material—above 25 rem are exceedingly unlikely for most RDD scenarios"

Peter D. Zimmerman, APS Physics.

"Research indicates that RDD have little effectiveness as military weapons because of their inability to to incapacitate soldiers"

Congressional Research Service.
 
 
 
Name dropping doesn't counter anything I have said.

 

So you are discrediting the large evidence in the book and what I heard first hand from a journalist who spent hours with the man we are talking about???

Please give me a break.

Obama also refused to accept the military's request for 40,000 troops, which was the only viable option for success in Afghanistan the military presented to him. Instead he created his own plan of 30,000 troops.

Obama has also completely pulled US fighting forces out of Iraq even all even General Petraeus warned the American people that Iraq may   flair up again .

Obama has also refused to say that the US is seeking a victory in afghanistan. But I will let you read about Obama now:

 
President Obama urgently looked for a way out of the war in Afghanistan last year, repeatedly pressing his top military advisers for an exit plan that they never gave him, according to secret meeting notes and documents cited in a new book by journalist Bob Woodward
 

 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...092106706.html 

And about Pakistan. Attacking the militants in Pakistan was actually a plan to scale DOWN the war proposed by VP Biden. By just using drones and special forces to root out Al Qaeda on the Pakistani border, Biden wanted to end the counterinsurgency/nation-building campaign on the ground. Obama likes this proposal, but the military does not.

And about  Bush not liking attacks inside Pakistan  :

If you think sanctions targeted at the regime will "punish" the population, you clearly don't know much about how IRR, the Islamist Rapist Regime, has mismanaged and destroyed Iran's economy far better than sanctions ever could.

Why can't everybody just leave the bleedin' Iranians alone? Ahmadinejad is all talk yet he's scared half of the western world to death by doing nothing more than TALKING, I love him for his purposeful-need-to-spark-controversy-at-any-publisiced-event.. but realistically speaking, nothinng is going to happen. I was in Y11 when my teacher scared the living sh*t out of us showing us exactly what a nuclear bomb could do and then saying the leader of Iran was a lunatic and it was plausible that a third world war could ensue because of them, i'm now in my second year of college and Ahmadinejads even said his nuclear regime is peaceful and not to mention plenty of other countries have them also (which my teacher cleverly didn't point out). Now unless Ahmadinejad is willing to commit suicide and homocide times a few million (for what reason? he doesn't believe in the Holocaust? huh?) no nuclear war is going to start on his terms. I don't know about his regime in Iran but really.. why has the western world suddenly climbed this moral pedestal where they actually care about other peoples welfare? Why don't they try donating a few billion to africa or there own homeless rather than wasting their money on trying to "disarm" Iran.
 
 
 
Its proven that Iran is enriching Uranium to a higher level than is needed for fuel....

 

It was also proven that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that could be launched against a major city within 45 minutes. Its been 7 years.
 
 
 
America invades countries for example Iraq so it can steal its diamonds

 

 
 
 
 
Yes, you get it! This is Exactly what I'm Advocating!
 

 

Obviously it is  

 Your solution  to the problem is attempting diplomacy with rapists and terrorists, a route that's been, tried, tested and FAILED, as the past 31 years have shown.

Are you just another one of these useless lefties that's willing to let dictatorships do whatever the hell they want in the name of "cultural relativism"?

No, I'm not actually.
Iran is a theocracy, not a dictatorship.
What I am basically saying, is that a repeat of the 2003 Iraq war would be a stupid idea. Sanctions would lead to an eventual war which wouldn't make the region any safer and would result in the death of many of the population.
 
 
 
So you are discrediting the large evidence in the book and what I heard first hand from a journalist who spent hours with the man we are talking about???

No, you give me a break and make sure what you write is correct.

I didn't discredit evidence from the book because you didn't any evidence from the book. I didn't discredit evidence from Woodward because you just said you met him.

Saying you have read a book or met a person isn't an argument.

 
Obama also refused to accept the military's request for 40,000 troops, which was the only viable option for success in Afghanistan the military presented to him. Instead he created his own plan of 30,000 troops.

 

I am not sure how this demonstrates that "Obama hates war". He expands the war but not as much as some would like.

 
Obama has also completely pulled US fighting forces out of Iraq even all even General Petraeus warned the American people that Iraq may   flair up again .

 

Petraeus was stating the obvious. You do not need to be a general to say a lot of things "may" happen in Iraq.

 
Obama has also refused to say that the US is seeking a victory in afghanistan. But I will let you read about Obama now:

 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...092106706.html 

 

And this demonstrates to you that he hates war?

He clearly says: "I'm not doing long-term nation-building. I am not spending a trillion dollars."

Obama doesn't hate war. His reasoning is far more complex.

 
And about Pakistan. Attacking the militants in Pakistan was actually a plan to scale DOWN the war proposed by VP Biden. By just using drones and special forces to root out Al Qaeda on the Pakistani border, Biden wanted to end the counterinsurgency/nation-building campaign on the ground.

And about  Bush not liking attacks inside Pakistan  :

The title of that piece: Bush Said to Give Orders Allowing Raids in Pakistan

Please check your facts next time you reply.

 

No, the quotes I gave were prior to his election. Whether he does it now or not is another thing. He clearly demonstrates the intention to expand war if need be.

Bush allowing the odd raid into Pakistan isn't new. I was talking about it being an explicit policy in the conduct of NATO troops. If an article comes out saying that Obama allows special forces into Iran for raids, then I wouldn't be too surprised either.
 
 
 
You talk about attempting diplomacy as if the brits and americans are whiter than white.  http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-...r_Ex-Detainees 

Now these are the real rapists, and literally too. Do you not remember abu graib? Guantanomo? Terrorism - hows invading a country on a pack of lies?

 

So basically you think two wrongs make a right. How ethical  

Besides which, the incidents in Iraq such as Abu Ghraib are not examples of policy, unlike the IRR which considers raping prisoners as a  religious duty . If you really haven't realised the difference between our Western democracy and the rights our citizens are entitled and the Islamic Republic's religious dictatorsup, I suggest you go and live in Iran. Go on, I dare you. Then we'll see how smug you are  

 
How old are you? I get the feeling you are just some naive child.
 

Old enough to realise the difference between dictatorships and democracies. Go back to year 3 and study some rudimentary history  
 
 
 
No, I'm not actually.
Iran is a theocracy, not a dictatorship.

 

 

The two are mutually exclusive are they? Get away with you.

 
What I am basically saying, is that a repeat of the 2003 Iraq war would be a stupid idea.
 

As do I. But sanctions =/= war.

 
Sanctions would lead to an eventual war which wouldn't make the region any safer and would result in the death of many of the population.
 

Absolute *******s.

Again, you have provided no alternative whatsoever.

And FYI sanctions against South Africa didn't result in a war.

The anonymous militiaman, exposing a part of the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's religious regime in Iran, told The Jerusalem Post that at age 18 he was "given the honor to temporarily marry young girls before they were sentenced to death"...
 

 
..............and prisoners are forced to have sexual intercourse with a guard, Fox News reported.
 

It seems we have ourself a very honest anonymous militiaman who suddenly feels burdened with guilt about the actions that he says he was 'honoured to do', so much so he decides to talk to the Jerusalem post and fox news. COOL STORY BRO!

Its not two wrongs make a right type convo here - this is a set of countries putting themselves on a pedestal telling others how to behave and boast about human rights whilst they allow the behaviour that occurs in abu graib. They also are the countries that continue to improve their nuclear arsenal (ironically the countries tasked with disarming of nuclear weapons are the ones that have it) whilst creating a media ****-storm about countries like Iran.

I love your last comment mate, this country and america just got put into a war despite public oposition particularly in the UK where the masses were completely and deliberately mislead.

Your last comment is just not worth responding to either.

Like I said - Im not interested in debating coz it just burns away time.

And if reading is a bit difficult for you (or in case you think Kaveh Shahrooz is an Israeli name   ) I suggest you watch the film Persepolis which also mentions this very well documented form of torture which the Islamic Republic routinely employs.

Whilst no one is perfect, over the past 31 years Britain's international and domestic human rights record is spotless compared to the Islamic Republic's. If you can't appreciate that, again I suggest you go back to year 3 and study some basic history and learn the difference between states which are accountable to their populace and those that aren't.

Well thats the pickle really - I deleted the post, not quickly enough though.

Torture? Britain and America tortures. This is known, this is fact. Except they like to act whiter than white and criticize other countries for human rights abuses whilst they ship prisoners to foreign soil where they can torture them.

I would suggest you read the entire story which also includes a denial from the iranian embassy in australia.

I would suggest you actually learn basic logic and reasoning as that story has ZERO weight behind it. Like I said - two pro israeli - and highly politically charged publications report of an anonymous militant that said he was honoured yet guilty to rape female prisoners.

Now we have an iranian embassy saying they do not rape female convicts, two militant pro israeli publications saying they have an anonymous man claiming they do - which one is correct here?

Why would you put more weight towards the publications than you do of the embassy? you have ZERO evidence so this is a non story. The job of a publication is to inform the public of fact. Fact comes through evidence. There is no evidence, it is therefore not fact and it shouldnt be published. its a complete non-story.

When talking about politics you mention 'no one is perfect'? That just sounds like childish naive thinking IMO
 
 
 
It was also proven that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that could be launched against a major city within 45 minutes. Its been 7 years.

 

Which has now been shown to be a complete lie so no it was not proven. If Iran has nothing to hide why do they now allow their facilities to be inspected by the UN? Why do they continue to regret the raft of offers for nuclear fuel swaps that they have been given.
 
 
 
x

 

It's not nice. But it certainly isn't a Dictatorship.
 

Maybe so. But I can't see it ending any other way.

The sanction were largely dependent on the Anti-Apartheid movement. Without a movement similar to that, sanctions would be viewed with resentment by the Iranian people. And with the effects of the sanctions being reported in the international media, sympathy for the American/Israeli position would diminish. To me, it would be counter-productive.
Tbh, I'm getting bored now. We disagree, and we're not likely to start agreeing soon.
Unless you have something truly pertinent to say, don't expect another response from me.
I'm going to the X Factor page

Did you not pick up the sarcasm? Of course it is a lie - my point is they lied about that and called it fact or 'proven' and do the same now - why would one quote it as if them 'proving' something offered any validity?

 http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009...-facility-iran 

They have let it UN inspectors. BTW when was the last time Israel's or America's plants were inspected?

EDIT: apologies for the expletives  
 
 
America has 10,000 + nukes and israel complain about 1 ?

That over a year ago do you have a more recent one or the results of that report?

Also Israel won't admit to having nuclear weapons although I would like to see the UN there as well and did't the Russians inspect US nuclear facilities and vise versa at some point during the cold war? The US is open about its weapon stocks so there is no need for any inspection.

This is rich coming from Isreal, who nuked kids and innocent civilians in gaza with weapons of mass destruction.

Also rich coming from the states if they actually listen to isreal -cough-.

funny how the two most terrorist countries of the past 2 centuries are being so hypocritical

both isreal and america have a very very fast array of nucleur weapons, and have both used them, or atleast killed many innocent people with weapons of mass destruction.

this spells freemasons, secret societies, and the illuminati and dirty politics.

Wajil farajahum.

We wait for the Mahdi(a.s.)
 
 
 
Yes one being held by an evil unstable regime

 

A country invading another on a complete pack of lies is certainly of the heavenly mould.
 
 
 
Yes one being held by an evil unstable regime

 

Quite ambiguous, what do you define as evil and unstable? I mean the mass killing of people in IRAQ by American soldiers can be construed as evil? How about the apartheid-like structure in Israel? Israel choose to defy UN law by building resettlements and in the 2006 Lebanon conflict killed 1191 people in comparison to a meagre 43 killed on their side? Surely that is evil ?
 
 
Isreal killed thousands of innocnet children with illegal weapons of mass destruction = FACT.

what happened to them?

Cough, i think we should confescate all american and isreali nucleur warheads, or weapons, WHICH HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN USED IN ILLEGAL, UNFAIR, AND INHUMAN WARS.

  Imam Mahdi(a.s.) will bring justice anyway, so run while you can

If you pro-Islamist Rapists didn't have Israel, who would you blame for all the world's problems?

But fair enough, since I'm right, it's more than easy to find sources

 
Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights, who had been assigned to examine human rights violations in Iran, emphasized the following in his report: "Virgin women who are sentenced to death are forced to enter into a marriage with a man. They lose their virginity before execution. Concerning this matter, the special reporter for the commission on torture would like to emphasize that rape is a form of torture

Take your Israeli conspiracy theories elsewhere, this has been known for decades.

Why don't I trust their embassies? Because it's an outpost of the regime. Why do you think, you genius?

Of course I don't trust them anymore than I would trust anything North Korea's embassy says. Of course their's evidence, tonnes of it, as shown by the Guardian, the Jerusalem Post, the UN, NCRI, etc.

 
It's not nice. But it certainly isn't a Dictatorship.

 

Please, please, please explain to me how the unelected Supreme Leader and Guardian Council which veto (the supposedly elected Parliament's) laws are anything other than dictatorial?

 
The sanction were largely dependent on the Anti-Apartheid movement. Without a movement similar to that, sanctions would be viewed with resentment by the Iranian people.
 

It's called Iran's struggle for democracy and freedom   It's been going on for over 100 years, you genius. There is a strong pro-democracy movement in Iran, didn't you watch the news at all last year?

Take your Israeli conspiracy theories elsewhere, this has been known for decades.

Why don't I trust their embassies? Because it's an outpost of the regime. Why do you think, you genius?

Of course I don't trust them anymore than I would trust anything North Korea's embassy says. Of course their's evidence, tonnes of it, as shown by the Guardian, the Jerusalem Post, the UN, NCRI, etc.

Please, please, please explain to me how the unelected Supreme Leader and Guardian Council which veto (the supposedly elected Parliament's) laws are anything other than dictatorial?

It's called Iran's struggle for democracy and freedom   It's been going on for over 100 years, you genius. There is a strong pro-democracy movement in Iran, didn't you watch the news at all last year?

 

Lol, the 'supreme' leader is a religious leader who is knowledge able in politics and has a firm interest in Iran. In Iran, yes, it's not perfect, but, principals are timeless (morals). They will not change principals, for popularity and society. Adultry is wrong, prostitution is wrong, bglt was thought of in britain and america more than 60 years ago as wrong, is still wrong. Stealing is wrong, alot of immoral things ect.

Believe me, america got oil from iraq, are on the verge of stealing 1trillion dollars worth(check) of minerals from afghanistan, and now want to try getting iran to make sure every one is defenceless.

America are idiots (the republicans/ other secret parties) / societies/rich network of families supplying weapons, if they think we, Britain, are their allies.

Cough, we are not.

Obama's great, the iraq war was illegal, official, and america not people, the socieities behind wars/illuminati, ARE THE REAL TERRORISTS, OPEN YOUR EYES!

The question is not why you dont trust embassies - Obviously they are representative of the regimes at home. But you wanted to twist the question in that direction. So good job!

The question was why would you give a couple of militant zionist publications more weight of evidence then an embassy, especially when the news piece is about an 'anonymous militiaman'?

Stop reverting to this stupid 'two wrongs make a right' ok? UNDERSTAND: When a country criticizes others over human rights violations then they ought to do as they preach. Im not saying these actions are right - im saying there is no point criticizing a country for breaching human rights when it does so itself.

Jerusalem Post = militant? Do you actually expect to be taken seriously?      

Of course he's anonymous, he fears repercussions back in Iran if he goes public with his name.

Is the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights also a liar? And NCRI? And the Guardian? In your twisted imagination, is everyone a liar except for the Islamic Republic?

So you ARE saying two wrongs make a right. Got it.

You're saying "there is no point criticizing a country for breaching human rights when it does so itself", i.e. "if the UK breaches human rights, that means its okay for the Islamic Republic to do so too, and anyone who says otherwise is a hypocrite".

Which is saying that "two wrongs make a right"  

In your ideal world, would everyone just keep shtum about human rights abuses or risk being denounced as hypocrites?
 
 
 
It would still take a lot of troops no doubt the US would win sure but the cost would be high and a full ground invasion is not something the US wants to do.

No, it doesnt mean it is ok for iran to do so too. read again, you may understand: If you are committing human rights violations, there is no point in criticizing other countries that do so as if they havent been doing the same.

Fair cop about the whole rape thing - Ill take your word for it although I certainly have to look further into this. I am concerned how you are associating islam with these actions - its complete nonsense and certainly not condoned by islam.

Well they haven't, the UK has never condoned rape in our prisons, and where it's occured internationally there have been investigations and the perpetrators would be disciplined.

Though I'll say again that the result of your point of view would be that no state could ever raise concerns about human rights violations. Which is grossly unjust.

How is he knowledgeable in politics? He may have a interest in Iran but he doesn't have a interest in the Iranian people. Just because something was acceptable or prohibited previously doesn't add to it's moral standing. A country should change for it's population and society. Adultery is wrong (you're a Muslims yes?

AMERICA - 1950'S, KILLED MILLIONS WITH NUCLEUR ATOMIC BOMBS

 

Incorrect. The United States dropped atomic bombs in 1945 - killing approx. 200,000 - to bring an end to a strenuous six-year global war, and resolve it without having to blockade and invade Japan (which would've resulted in millions of civilian deaths).

 
AMERICA, 1970'S PUT SADAM INTO POWER
 

Incorrect. The Baathists came to power in the late 60s under al-Bakr. Saddam was the vice-president, with him seizing power in an internal coup in 1979.

 
AMERICA, ALSO PUT ALGAEDA INTO POWER
 

Incorrect. America (and China, and Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia) trained numerous resistance groups in Afghanistan to resist the Soviets. Of which one was the mujahideen. Which contained numerous divergent groups, of which merely one contained Osama bin Laden. I'd have been surprised if these groups didn't contain its fair amount of religious fanatics.

 
AMERICA IN THE 1995'S INVADED IRAQ!
STOLE OIL, KILLED PEOPLE
 

Incorrect. It expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991. It should've gone on to invade Iraq though, and supported the Shia and Kurdish insurgents who were actively calling for them to do so.
 
 
 
Sure maybe if you are dealing with two fairly stable countries but Israel is known to strike out at anything it deems as a thread and Iran would happily destory the world as they seem to think the only good planet is an Islamic one

 

Where do you get off saying rubbish like this? Iran would happily destroy the world? I mean really?

Well the actions they have to take in order to rape these women itself shows that it is not condoned in Islam. God can recognise the difference between a legitimate marriage and one that is solely for such actions.

Where they have occurred they have been investigated? Is that why Liam Fox is venomously blocking a full public inquiry into claims of, guess what, rape of Iraqi prisoners? Being tortured and stripped.

It is hypocrisy when the allied forces have retreated to the argument that at least they removed Saddam who committed human rights abuses against his people - well that is exactly what they are doing in Iraq.

Its not a conspiracy theory to say that america went to iraq for the oil - especially when they are now advising the government on 'hydrocarbon legislation'. Political editors and commentators do not shy away from such a theory - they were saying it before they even went to war. Its all a well to call something a conspiracy theory but that does not make it incorrect - its just a way of undermining an argument and making those who say it seem whacked.

Frankly if they are their for WMD - there isnt any, that was a lie. Then they say they are liberating women and Iraq, neither of which they have done, carrying out human rights abuses along the way.

So if they are not in it for oil, what the **** are they in it for?

Just face it. The plight of the Iraqi and Afghan people, together with a contempt for totalitarianism played a large part in the decision to establish democracy. You will note that during the wars in Yugoslavia. It was prominent Neocons who supported armed intervention to rescue the Bosnians from extermination by the christian fascists led by Milosevic. How would you explain this? During this conflict the US administration under Clinton, as well as Britain and other large nations supported Milosevic for a long time and watched pathetically as Sarajevo was smashed to the ground and 40,000 Bosnian Muslims were wiped off the face of the earth.

Was this neocon support for Oil? For mineral wealth? You must be rational. Complete anti-Americanism is just ridiculous and leads you to stubbornly defend ridiculous points like you do above. I will freely admit that the oil wealth played its part in the decision. But it was not why Bush liberated Iraq. if they were after oil and a quick source of wealth. They would not embark upon a multi trillion dollar war. I mean, if they were that shallow they would only care about the four to eight years they were in office. Why would long term security even matter?

Yes, they spent billions so they can be good Samaritans  

Otherwise - why else did they go there? They lied every step of the way about their motives for war so why would you trust in them being a friendly force?

There are plenty of countries were the plight of its people are not great.

 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/wo...ar-516400.html 

 
Iraqis face the dire prospect of losing up to $200bn (£116bn) of the wealth of their country if an American-inspired plan to hand over development of its oil reserves to US and British multinationals comes into force next year. A report produced by American and British pressure groups warns Iraq will be caught in an "old colonial trap" if it allows foreign companies to take a share of its vast energy reserves. The report is certain to reawaken fears that the real purpose of the 2003 war on Iraq was to ensure its oil came under Western control.

The Iraqi government has announced plans to seek foreign investment to exploit its oil reserves after the general election, which will be held next month. Iraq has 115 billion barrels of proved oil reserves, the third largest in the world.

According to the report, from groups including War on Want and the New Economics Foundation (NEF), the new Iraqi constitution opened the way for greater foreign investment. Negotiations with oil companies are already under way ahead of next month's election and before legislation is passed, it said.

The groups said they had amassed details of high-level pressure from the US and UK governments on Iraq to look to foreign companies to rebuild its oil industry. It said a Foreign Office code of practice issued in summer last year said at least $4bn would be needed to restore production to the levels before the 1990-91 Gulf War. "Given Iraq's needs it is not realistic to cut government spending in other areas and Iraq would need to engage with the international oil companies to provide appropriate levels of foreign direct investment to do this," it said.

Yesterday's report said the use of production sharing agreements (PSAs) was proposed by the US State Department before the invasion and adopted by the Coalition Provisional Authority. "The current government is fast-tracking the process. It is already negotiating contracts with oil companies in parallel with the constitutional process, elections and passage of a Petroleum Law," the report, Crude Designs, said.

Earlier this year a BBC Newsnight report claimed to have uncovered documents showing the Bush administration made plans to secure Iraqi oil even before the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US. Based on its analysis of PSAs in seven countries, it said multinationals would seek rates of return on their investment from 42 to 162 per cent, far in excess of typical 12 per cent rates.

Taking an assumption of $40 a barrel, below the current price of almost $60, and a likely contract term of 25 to 40 years, it said that Iraq stood to lose between £74bn and $194bn. Andrew Simms, the NEF's policy director, said: "Over the last century, Britain and the US left a global trail of conflict, social upheaval and environmental damage as they sought to capture and control a disproportionate share of the world's oil reserves. Now it seems they are determined to increase their ecological debts at Iraq's expense. Instead of a new beginning, Iraq is caught in a very old colonial trap."

Louise Richards, chief executive of War on Want, said: "People have increasingly come to realise the Iraq war was about oil, profits and plunder. Despite claims from politicians that this is a conspiracy theory, our report gives detailed evidence to show Iraq's oil profits are well within the sights of the oil multinationals."

The current Iraqi government has indicated that it wants to treble production from two million barrels a day this year to six million. The US Energy Information Administration said such an increase would ease "market tensions" that have kept the price high. But governments and oil companies in the West said the report was purely hypothetical and that the issue was a matter for the Iraqi people. They also pointed out that Iraq needed money to rebuild in the sector.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said the country's oil industry was in desperate need of investment after years of under-investment, UN sanctions, vandalism by Saddam Hussein and more recent sabotage by insurgents and general looting. "The Iraqi government has made it clear that the decision is a matter for its authorities but they understand that it would require a lot of investment," he said. He said it was not surprising that Iraq should look to outside experts to help rebuild an industry that was the key source of revenue to help rebuild the country.

"We work closely with other departments such as the Treasury to give assistance and advice," he said, adding that the Foreign Office had not been involved in specific lobbying.

Gregg Muttitt, of Platform, a campaign group that co-authored the report, said Iraq had an existing - albeit damaged - network of oil expertise and could use current revenues or new borrowings to fund investment. The report named several companies, including the Anglo-Dutch Shell group, as jockeying for position before a new government is elected. In 2003, Walter van de Vijver, then head of exploration and production, said investors would need "some assurance of future income and a supportive contractual arrangement". The groupsaidyesterday that the involvement of foreign oil companies would be determined by the new Iraqi administration. "We aspire to establish a long-term presence in Iraq and a long-term relationship with the Iraqis, including the newly elected government."

No multinationals are operating in Iraq now because of the poor security situation.

From an article in the Telegraph id hardly go as far as to dismiss it as just a conspiracy theory either. The article does show how much consideration and plans the US and UK put towards the oil reserves for Iraq. You can ignore that bit if you want. Actually read the whole article - its hardly that long anyway.

Note that I am actually delivering you sources from substantial organisations - that does not make the content true but its a hell of a lot more substantial then what you thought was an interesting comment somewhere on TSR.

Funnily enough it has been 7 years since the WMD in 45 minutes claim.
 
 
A very intersting discussion to be held within the context of TSR, because:

Many love to hate Israel. They point at a poor record of human rights, disregard for international law and something of a lust for war as a way of asserting themselves.

So therefore, they automatically support the underdog (very British, very liberal, very honourable). The problem here is that sub-conciously, people compare the feud between Israel and Iran with the feud between Israel and Palestine. We're used to seeing Gaza portrayed as the honourable underdog, under attack from Israel. People fall into the trap of seeing Iran as a 'nicer' state than Israel, much as they might see Palestine as a 'nicer' entity than Israel, and this is evident in some of the posts on this thread.

This is categorically untrue. Yes, Israel have a poor record - and yes, they seem to be ready and willing to exert their authority; however whilst Israel might be seen as an untrustworthy state, Iran is a deeply sinister and hostile nation. Resting at the centre of the 'axis of evil', it is an 'Islamic Republic'. This is a system of government whereby Sharia law takes precedence over civil law, and where a religious hierarchy effectively forms the state.

This is a state which has declared: ''The regime occupying Jerusalem [Israel] must vanish from the page of time''.

This is a state which regularly stones people to daeth for adultery and homosexuality, and which is due to execute a woman by stoning (for adultery) within the next few days. Her lawyer and brother have been arbitrarily imprisoned for trying to rally support to her cause.

This is a state which ruthlessly imprisoned and beat protestors who expressed their concern over the recent presidential election, which was so blatantly rigged.

I appreciate that Israel does not have an excellent track record - however I do not see how anyone can consider Ahmadinejad and his corrupt cronies more trustworthy than Israel. I also imagine that Israel poses a far lower risk to the West than Iran would.

QFT :

 
Israel is no Mother Theresa, however, it's certainly the lesser of the two evils.

 
 
 
 
 http://articles.cnn.com/2008-05-04/p..._s=PM:POLITICS 

 

Yes if Iran launched a nuclear strike on Israel the US would be well with in its right to wipe out Iran
 
 
 
Quite ambiguous, what do you define as evil and unstable? I mean the mass killing of people in IRAQ by American soldiers can be construed as evil? How about the apartheid-like structure in Israel? Israel choose to defy UN law by building resettlements and in the 2006 Lebanon conflict killed 1191 people in comparison to a meagre 43 killed on their side? Surely that is evil ?

 

Stoning women to death for adultery ranks pretty highly as evil and yes so does killing innocent civilians and illegal Israeli settlement building
 
 
 
You said that Iran refuses to allow inspectors in. I showed you an instant were they did, not too long ago in diplomatic timescales.

 

But you did not give a source for the release of the results of said inspections and a lot can change in the space of almost 3 years
 
 
 
[I]This is a state which has threatened to 'wipe Israel off the face of the Earth'.

QFT :

 

No that is disputed. He did not say that. That is typical and typical media exageration for political purposes.

One translation of what he says, cited on the guardian, 'The regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time'

Do not try and make it seem as if they want to wipe out jews or something ridiculous like that.

Well my comment did explain and give you the answers you wanted, which you didn't tackle and went ahead to provide another source to back up your theory btw. I'm going finish of with this article from 2009:

.....

Thus, the vulgar and hysterical part of the "war for oil" interpretation has been discredited: Iraq retains its autonomy, the share awarded to outsiders in development is far from exorbitant, and there is no real correlation between U.S. interests and the outcome. Except that we do have a very genuine interest in the success of this endeavor as it unfolds. If the recuperation of Iraq's oil fields persists, and if production levels continue to rise, the country will begin to reacquire what it lost under the insane regime of Saddam Hussein, which debased the oil infrastructure and then squandered its proceeds.

Iraqi officials said this proved their independence from U.S. influence and that their two bidding rounds this year for deals to tap Iraq's vast oil reserves, the world's third largest, were free of foreign political interference.

 

This is pure facts and not speculations and 'secret meetings'.

Sunday 25 October 2009, that is hardly three years away, or are you as stupid as I fear you are? WTF DOES IT MATTER ABOUT A REPORT?

Read again: You said Iran refuses to allow inspectors in, I showed you a source which shows they have. Simple as that. In what way does a report interfere with this statement? Now you wouldn't expect these reports to be entirely accurate either. Do you reckon if they found something they would have raved about it by now as an excuse to raid? I think so. Idiot, stop asking about the report - it is irrelevant to the argument.

Just to repeat for you : You said Iran refuses to allow inspectors in, I showed you a source which shows they have.
 
 
 
No that is disputed. He did not say that...

 

Is the stoning of "adulterous" women and homosexuals disputed? What about the election of Mr Ahmadinijad? - that's disputed alright!

What answers did it give me? Why are you advocating what I may or may not have learned from some random post on TSR?

If it did answer questions, it didnt answer then why America went to war in Iraq - a question you have avoided.

If they were a friendly force and cared only to install democracy to the Iraqis at the cost of thousands of their soldiers and billions of dollars - why did they consistently lie and fabricate their reasoning to going to war in the first place. Another question you have not answered.

If they aimed to deliver a democracy and then effectively installed a puppet government in Iraq. They advised them on hydrocarbon law and put allot of consideration of what they wanted to do with the oil.

The article, from at least substantial organization, quoted from many people who were involved in these discussions and planning. Read the article again, or actually read it fully (doubt you have the first time around).

One translation of what he says, cited on the guardian, 'The regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time'
/260107offthemap.htm[/url]

 

I'll tell you what The Guardian says:

Iran's new president created a sense of outrage in the west yesterday by describing Israel as a "disgraceful blot" that should be "wiped off the face of the earth".

 http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/27/israel.iran 

Are you going to answer my question about stonings and Ahmadinijad's legitimacy now?
 
 
 
Yes if Iran launched a nuclear strike on Israel the US would be well with in its right to wipe out Iran

 

Are you kidding me?

This is exactly why Iran should develop Nuclear weapons.

Well what would you suggest that the USA do (bearing in mind any Iranian strike would have been intended to wipe out NY/DC)? Send a few troops over and ask them not to do that again if possible?
 
 
 
Sunday 25 October 2009, that is hardly three years away, or are you as stupid as I fear you are? WTF DOES IT MATTER ABOUT A REPORT? Wow calm down I miss read the title

Read again: You said Iran refuses to allow inspectors in, I showed you a source which shows they have. Simple as that. In what way does a report interfere with this statement? Now you wouldn't expect these reports to be entirely accurate either. Do you reckon if they found something they would have raved about it by now as an excuse to raid? I think so. Idiot, stop asking about the report - it is irrelevant to the argument.

Just to repeat for you : You said Iran refuses to allow inspectors in, I showed you a source which shows they have.

 

 http://www.stltoday.com/news/nationa...1ba4b190e.html  explain this then?

 http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/297473  and this?

A recurring issue throughout the report, as in the last report, concerns Iran’s
minimalist application of safeguards, in particular where the IAEA seeks information
about new enrichment facilities that are reportedly under construction, design information
for the Fordow facility, centrifuge production, and uranium mining and related activities.
The IAEA continues to note that Iran’s refusal to be bound by its traditional safeguards
agreement and subsidiary arrangements does not allow the Agency to build confidence in
the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear activities.

One has to worry that Iran is working to degrade safeguards to such a degree that if it
does decide to divert low enriched uranium or other nuclear material to use in making a
nuclear weapon, the diversion would remain undetected for a longer period of time

What answers did it give me? Why are you advocating what I may or may not have learned from some random post on TSR?

If it did answer questions, it didnt answer then why America went to war in Iraq - a question you have avoided.

 

It did. Re-read

 
If they were a friendly force and cared only to install democracy to the Iraqis at the cost of thousands of their soldiers and billions of dollars - why did they consistently lie and fabricate their reasoning to going to war in the first place. Another question you have not answered.

If they aimed to deliver a democracy and then effectively installed a puppet government in Iraq. They advised them on hydrocarbon law and put allot of consideration of what they wanted to do with the oil.

 

Re read. He provided several reasons and even agreed that Oil played a part (albeit not significant).

I've just shown you why your Oil theory is wrong. Before telling me to read another source, read mine.

Its political game playing. Why they are refusing now is not know but they take the view they are being particularly and unfairly targeted. Id love to see some UN report about Israels failure to comply with UN law and stop the building of settlements in the gaza strip, yet alone the illegal blockade.

Well obviously it's totally hypothetical - even if they had the nuclear warhead they wouldn't have any way of getting it to the US.

The point you made was that if the US were hit with nuclear weapons, they should not be allowed to strike back, and I ridiculed this point.

I have no idea what your talking about? If Iran launched a strike to wipe out Israel I have no problem with Iran being destroyed as it would be self defence the same if Iran wiped out Israel if Israel attacked first.

Or should contries just sit back and wait for an apology after being nuked.

I honestly applaud and thank you for amending your post. I never disputed the rest of your post, I just did not like that line.

If you are referring to the woman who was stoned to death for cheating and plotting to kill her husband - there was a similar case in the US that lead to the death penalty. Islamic law strictly prohibits adultery. It is an islamic country so you would expect it to follow islamic laws just as other countries follow law based on their religion.

As for homosexuals, I will be honest to say that I believe it is a sin. Whether it should lead to stoning or not I doubt but Iran is not like the US say where homosexuality is championed.

Ahmadinijad's legitimacy - I agree with you on this one. Although I would add that the west themselves installed ayatollah khomenei as a dictator of iran, and now behave as if they are genuinely concerned for the democracy of the country. It is highly likely imo that they attempted to influence the election as they usually influence many other governments, such as the egyptian (my own) the iraqi and afghan government etc. It is tiring.

I am also glad that you acknowledged the fact I'd edited it; I wasn't expecting you to honour that.

Your views on Islamic law are clearly personal and it is not my place to dispute them. However is homosexuality a big enough sin in your books to deserve public execution?

You are right that the current case does involve an alleged murder however this does not escape the fact that the Iranian state (as far as I am aware) reserves the right to stone for adultery.

Basically the point I was initially trying to make (I hate drifting too far off-topic and getting into tit-for-tat arguments, so I'll try and bring it back to the topic) is that whilst Israel is a potentially very dubious state, I would argue that Iran has a real hatred of Israel and therefore might choose to use nuclear weaponry against it, having huge consequences.

Look, the UN condem Iran one day and the next they are sanctioned and eventually blown to smithereens. Condem israel and you are either ignored or branded anti-semetic. Its telling for such a report you had to quote some random news site. It would be all over the mainstream media if it were Iran.
 
 
 
No, you give me a break and make sure what you write is correct.

I didn't discredit evidence from the book because you didn't any evidence from the book. I didn't discredit evidence from Woodward because you just said you met him.

Saying you have read a book or met a person isn't an argument.

 

Well because I didn't want to elaborate. I wanted you to take some initiative and research it yourself. Instead, you failed so I had to disprove you the long way.

 
I am not sure how this demonstrates that "Obama hates war". He expands the war but not as much as some would like.

 

Well he expanded it because that is what had to be done, but now he wants to get out of Afghanistan quickly. No one is advising him to leave Afghanistan quickly - besides Biden - that plan is of his own initiative, and it is because he dislikes war.

 
Petraeus was stating the obvious. You do not need to be a general to say a lot of things "may" happen in Iraq.

 

He didn't say may happen, he said will happen. However, it seems like you agree with me that leaving Iraq when we left was destabilizing to the country - so why did Obama do it again?? Oh yea, it's because he doesn't like war.

Now I don't know why you keep on arguing against this - it isn't a bad thing to dislike war...

And this demonstrates to you that he hates war?

 
He clearly says: "I'm not doing long-term nation-building. I am not spending a trillion dollars."

Obama doesn't hate war. His reasoning is far more complex.

 

The trillion dollars was just an excuse.

"This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan," Obama is quoted as telling White House aides as he laid out his reasons for adding 30,000 troops in a short-term escalation.

Frustrated with his military commanders for consistently offering only options that required significantly more troops, Obama finally crafted his own strategy, dictating a classified six-page "terms sheet" that sought to limit U.S. involvement, Woodward reports in "Obama's Wars," to be released on Monday.

President Obama urgently looked for a way out of the war in Afghanistan last year, repeatedly pressing his top military advisers for an exit plan that they never gave him, according to secret meeting notes and documents cited in a new book by journalist Bob Woodward.

 
No, the quotes I gave were prior to his election. Whether he does it now or not is another thing. He clearly demonstrates the intention to expand war if need be.

Bush allowing the odd raid into Pakistan isn't new. I was talking about it being an explicit policy in the conduct of NATO troops. If an article comes out saying that Obama allows special forces into Iran for raids, then I wouldn't be too surprised either.

 

And people never renege on what they said on the campaign trail? What is more telling - what someone says or what someone does?

Did I not show you a bloody NY times article stating that Bush ordered in a policy of drone strikes or what??
 
 
 
Ignore what? I don't understand your post

 

Well he said that if Iran struck Israel then he believed Israel should strike Iran.

You got that message.

He also said that if Israel struck Iran, Iran should strike Israel.

You ignored that completely.
 
 
UN Security Council: America, Britain, France, China, Russia.

Three of those members actively gave Nuclear weapons technology to Israel with the intention of them making nuclear weapons.

Well I said I doubt it is necessary to stone homosexuals. This does, however, boil down to differences in culture. In the west it is illegal to have more than one wife, even if all parties are happy and satisfied whilst have countless sexual partners is promoted. In countries like Iran you cannot have countless sexual partners but you can have more than one wife if all parties are happy.

I dont like the idea of multiple marriage either, frankly it is not my cup of tea but im sure there are people out there who do.

The point isn't about Israel's response, it's the United States' and it's belief that it should respond to a non attack on its territory by obliterating 70 million people.

Stop telling me what I ignore if you haven't even read the article genius.

Well that was just the first source to come up on google I did't really look very hard.

Even so Iran causes its own problem's. It wont cooperate with any it will not work with the UN it is making things difficult for any inspectors that are over there.

However without conclusive proof of nuclear weapons it is unlikely for there to be a strike by the US, very unlikely the support is just not there in the US.

Israel is far more likely to attack Iran but the US is trying to keep Israel on a tight leash. If they did launch a strike with out proof on Iran then everything in the Middle East goes to hell I realyl cannot see it happning

Grow up.

When the poster said that Iran and Israel would both have the right to retaliation - he implied that it was a universal right of any country that is attacked to fight back.

So by ignoring that point you are blinding yourself to what he said.

Oh and I believe if Iran attacks Israel that the US should strike Iran hard. Same with any country.

On the evidence of the Iraq war, It really does not seem too dificult to drum up some 'proof' along side a sustained propaganda campaign for the purposes of going to war. Frankly they do not even listen to the UN, im not sure they really care what anybody thinks. Israel itself says this - they control american politics.

What are you talking about? The article which I'm referring to has NOTHING TO DO WITH ISRAEL's RESPONSE TO A NUCLEAR ATTACK, whether Israel is attacked by Iran or not, it's up to them to decide how they want to retaliate.

And to your last point, it's just confirms what a cancer Israel is to the region.

People are still pissed that their governments lied to them and many people are sceptical of Iran having nuclear weapons as has been proven by this forum, plus countries do not have the stomach for war not with the economic downturn.

I wouldn't say people are particularly sceptical about Iran have nuclear weapons but sceptical of the propaganda attacks and over exaggeration Iran is subjected to. Ahmadinijad has made one or two quite damming and insightful speeches which the US continues to walk out of, they shed serious light into the hypocrisy of these states. Im not talking about the most recent one. If you care they are on youtube but there you are.

Iran, according to them, have been subjected to threats of nuclear attacks anyway. It seems hypocritical that such states would then exaggerate and then condem iran for allegedly threatening Israel. It is ridiculous for these states to complain about a country acquiring one nuclear weapon when they hold tens of thousands. There would be no point in using a nuke anyway as it would likely lead to retaliation of which would wipe out both parties involved.
 
 
 
You do realize that most Iranians like the current regime.
The ones that don't just happen to be the ones with access to foreign media to better their case.

 

Most Iranians like the regime? Are you on crack?

I have to say I am dissappointed you have now said this. Of course there is a difference between 'wiping israel of the map' and 'the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time'

The first is consistent with bombing the country to smithereens in such the way israeli specialises in. The second does not have the same level of aggression and does show regret at the current regime in Israel that lead to the displacement of millions of innocent muslims from their homes. It suggests the removal of such a regime but does not suggest so militarily as politicians are anxious to do so to condem Iran and justify possible invasion in the future. I am no history buff but I know that Jerusalem has seen many regimes come and go so I do not see the malice in such statement.

Many jews, israelis, non muslims, even some politicians oppose the current Israeli regime.

 
The Iranian president is undeniably an opponent of Zionism or, if you prefer the phrase, the Zionist regime. But so are substantial numbers of Israeli citizens, Jews as well as Arabs. The anti-Zionist and non-Zionist traditions in Israel are not insignificant. So we should not demonise Ahmadinejad on those grounds alone.
 
 
 
 
A very intersting discussion to be held within the context of TSR, because:

Many love to hate Israel. They point at a poor record of human rights, disregard for international law and something of a lust for war as a way of asserting themselves.

So therefore, they automatically support the underdog (very British, very liberal, very honourable). The problem here is that sub-conciously, people compare the feud between Israel and Iran with the feud between Israel and Palestine. We're used to seeing Gaza portrayed as the honourable underdog, under attack from Israel. People fall into the trap of seeing Iran as a 'nicer' state than Israel, much as they might see Palestine as a 'nicer' entity than Israel, and this is evident in some of the posts on this thread.

This is categorically untrue. Yes, Israel have a poor record - and yes, they seem to be ready and willing to exert their authority; however whilst Israel might be seen as an untrustworthy state, Iran is a deeply sinister and hostile nation. Resting at the centre of the 'axis of evil', it is an 'Islamic Republic'. This is a system of government whereby Sharia law takes precedence over civil law, and where a religious hierarchy effectively forms the state.

This is a state which has declared: ''The regime occupying Jerusalem [Israel] must vanish from the page of time''.

This is a state which regularly stones people to daeth for adultery and homosexuality, and which is due to execute a woman by stoning (for adultery) within the next few days. Her lawyer and brother have been arbitrarily imprisoned for trying to rally support to her cause.

This is a state which ruthlessly imprisoned and beat protestors who expressed their concern over the recent presidential election, which was so blatantly rigged.

I appreciate that Israel does not have an excellent track record - however I do not see how anyone can consider Ahmadinejad and his corrupt cronies more trustworthy than Israel. I also imagine that Israel poses a far lower risk to the West than Iran would.

QFT :

 

A nuclear Israel is better than a nuclear Iran.

What's QFT about that?
 
 
No country should have nukes.
 
 
 
Most Iranians like the regime? Are you on crack?

 

No,But you are delusional.
 
 
 
Well they haven't, the UK has never condoned rape in our prisons, and where it's occured internationally there have been investigations and the perpetrators would be disciplined.

Though I'll say again that the result of your point of view would be that no state could ever raise concerns about human rights violations. Which is grossly unjust.

IslamIST Rapist Regime   My problem is with Islamism (i.e. Islam [or any religion for that matter] as a political philosophy) not individual Muslims.

Though just so you know, the scum who carry out these rapes claim Islam does condone it...

 

Wait. Setting aside everything else that you've said, don't you contradict yourself?

You claim that you're against any religion as a political philosophy, should that not apply to Israel as well?
 
 
 
A nuclear Israel is better than a nuclear Iran.

What's QFT about that?

 

Q uoted f or t ruth because it gave a 'TL;DR' summary of my argument (which was that Israel was the lesser of the two evilas)
 
 
 
Wait. Setting aside everything else that you've said, don't you contradict yourself?

Israeli policy is not governed by the tenets of Judaism. It is governed by the need to protect its people - who are Jewish.

Massive difference. Israel is a Jewish country, just like Turkey is Muslim, England is Protestant, and Brazil is Catholic.
 
 
 
A nuclear Israel is better than a nuclear Iran.

What's QFT about that?

 

I care little about the supposed dispute with Iran.

But on the point of a nuclear Israel, it's not. Forgive me for thinking it's a highly-frightening prospect for all civillians living around and in Israel for her to have nukes considering the following facts:

1. Last Spring,  Rose Gottemoeller, an assistant secretary of state and Washington's chief nuclear arms negotiator, asked Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Israel refused.

2.  The United Nations passed a resolution calling on Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to submit to inspections.  Israel refused.

3.  The IAEA asked Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to submit to inspections.  Israel refused.

4. Mordechai Vanunu, Israel's nuclear whistleblower, was  jailed in 1986 for publishing photographs of Israel's nuclear bomb factory at Dimona.  Olenka Frenkiel reveals the extent of Israel's nuclear gagging.

5. Israel made the same accusations against Iraq that it is making against Iran, leading up to Israel's bombing of the power station at Osirik. Following the invasion of 2003, i  nternational experts examined the ruins of the power station at Osirik and found no evidence of a clandestine weapons factory in the rubble. 

6.  Recently revealed documents prove not only that Israel has nuclear weapos, but actually tried to sell some to Apartheid South Africa.  Who else Israel approached to sell nuclear weapons remains an unasked question.

7.  In 1965, Israel stole over 200-600 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from the United States. 

8. Declassified documents from the former South African regime prove not only that  Israel has had nuclear weapons for decades, but has tried to sell them to other countries .
 
 
   
 
I care little about the supposed dispute with Iran.

But on the point of a nuclear Israel, it's not. Forgive me for thinking it's a highly-frightening prospect for all civillians living around and in Israel for her to have nukes considering the following facts:

1. Last Spring,  Rose Gottemoeller, an assistant secretary of state and Washington's chief nuclear arms negotiator, asked Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Israel refused.

2.  The United Nations passed a resolution calling on Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to submit to inspections.  Israel refused.

3.  The IAEA asked Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to submit to inspections.  Israel refused.

4. Mordechai Vanunu, Israel's nuclear whistleblower, was  jailed in 1986 for publishing photographs of Israel's nuclear bomb factory at Dimona.  Olenka Frenkiel reveals the extent of Israel's nuclear gagging.

Well said!
Great debate going from both side  
 
 
 
I hate Israel. They are a dispicable country and have done absoultely nothing to stop their constant war crimes, the raping, the pillaging, the threatening and obviously have no intention of peacefull existance.

 

How can you hate a country. Its indivduals that commit crimes. Individuals that sanction the building of homes on the West Bank etc.

There are plenty of people in Israel opposed to the settler movements, and to zionism itself. Many of these Jewish people sacrifice their lives trying to help their Palastenian neighbours.

Hate views, hate specific people, hate movements. But you can't hate a country.

Not much of a workload currently to be honest.

So that means that you have a BS, easy job if you spend all your time dealing with the Israel/Palestine conflict - which has very few deaths compared to other conflicts.
 
 
 
Wait. Setting aside everything else that you've said, don't you contradict yourself?

You claim that you're against any religion as a political philosophy, should that not apply to Israel as well?

 

Erm, Israel isn't a theocratic dictatorship run by an insane cleric who thinks he has a  divine right to rule .

I think the issue, going by the article you gave me, isn't really about theocracy or not any more. What is different from him being a dictator while maintaining a semblance (only semblance, I didn't say he has it) of legitimacy from maybe the Soviet Union under Lenin or Stalin, where power was really wielded by one man, or Hitler under Germany, or North Korea under Kim?

They all used excuses to retain their power. I honestly doubt Iran's government would embrace the image of religiosity if it didn't keep them in power/their legitimacy in the eyes of the people.

I honestly think there is nothing wrong with a population preferring to rule themselves based on religious tenets. It is their free choice. However, when it starts getting twisted for alternative reasons, then there is something wrong.

I don't think all of Iran is like what you suppose it to be. I don't think all of Israel is like that either. They just happen to hold political views that oppose yours. Do not forget, the elections in Iran were rigged by the people in power to keep their power. It does not mean that the Iranians support their president. As insane as he is, I think the Supreme Leader of Iran (I forgot his name) will not be so suicidal as to launch an attack that is not in self-defence.

I do find that Israel smacks of hypocrisy though. It would do better to maintain an image of being the victim rather than the aggressor in international media.

Im not disputing this but I am asking for evidence. There is no point on conclusively stating such things with no evidence.

Well because I didn't want to elaborate. I wanted you to take some initiative and research it yourself. Instead, you failed so I had to disprove you the long way.?

 

If you didn't want to elaborate, then that is your problem. Name dropping isn't an argument.

 
Well he expanded it because that is what had to be done, but now he wants to get out of Afghanistan quickly. No one is advising him to leave Afghanistan quickly - besides Biden - that plan is of his own initiative, and it is because he dislikes war.?

 

It isn't just that he dislikes war. Obama is not a moron. One single emotion does not drive his entire foreign policy.

 
He didn't say may happen, he said will happen.

 

" General Petraeus warned the American people that Iraq may flair up again "

Your words not mine.

 
However, it seems like you agree with me that leaving Iraq when we left was destabilizing to the country - so why did Obama do it again?? Oh yea, it's because he doesn't like war.

Now I don't know why you keep on arguing against this - it isn't a bad thing to dislike war...

 

No, I didn't agree with you.

I never said it was a bad thing to dislike war. I think virtually everyone dislikes war. It is whether you believe it to be a necessity or not.

You are claiming that it is his primary motivation is an opinion. I am saying that his motivations are far more complex.

 
The trillion dollars was just an excuse.

 

Not really. The financial implications of the 2007 financial crisis have been devastating to America and the West in general. America cannot afford to prop the Government subsidised Military Corporations whilst spending vast amounts on welfare.

A trillion is a huge amount and is probably an underestimation of the money needed for Afghanistan.

 
"This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off.......... in a new book by journalist Bob Woodward.

 

I know. He wants to get out Afghanistan. We are not arguing about that point.

 
And people never renege on what they said on the campaign trail? What is more telling - what someone says or what someone does?

Did I not show you a bloody NY times article stating that Bush ordered in a policy of drone strikes or what??

 

When you are saying something, you are doing something. There was no need for him to say it on the campaign trail. He was unnecessarily Hawkish even in comparison to the Republicans on the issue.

Why didn't he do it? He was advised not to since the logistics of such a operation would be.

I am not sure why you are brining up Bush. I didn't say you were wrong.

Don't have an opinion but I'm leaning to disagree with it because of the economical disadvantages that the war has brought.
 
 
 
I'm so amused lol! Iran is dangerous that what the media and America & Israel wants you to believe. Many countries have nucluar weapons so why can't Iran have it either? Because Israel is scared of Iran and not of the other surrounding countries. America invades countries for example Iraq so it can steal its oil and diamonds etc and ofcourse to have a global military bases. And who control America, Zionist!
Where is the evidence of Iran being a threat??? After the socalled 'nuclear weapons' Iraq supposed to have, do people really believe what America or media says? Come on, switch the TV off and get into the real world!

 

Your a total idiot. Iran is a huge threat. They talk about wiping out Israel completly of the map, they hate the west and they blame the UK and america for everything. They support terroists in Lebanon and supply them with weapons, they supply palestinian terroists with weapons to fight israel. As you can see from the above reasons, Iran defaintly is not a threat!!!!! Do not give iran nuclear weapons....it will probably course world war 3.

And with Iraq, something had to be done - The man in charge was a maniac killing thousands of people and the state was unable to control it self.

****!!!!

Call yourself a idiot! Iran atleast hasn't invaded other countries or kill millions innocent people! America and all the western countries who particpated are terrorist just like the ones they trying to 'defeat'. Killing innocecnt people is terrorism and Israel is doing that a on daily basis plus created an apartheid state there and made the Palestians homeless in their OWN country!
Iran isn't a threat, it will not use nuclear weapons unless invoked ofcourse.
And regarding Iraq, Saddam Hussein was appointed by America and didnt had any weapons of mass destructions. He might be tyran but definetely less of the evil than America who killed millions, raped and abused the people in Aghanistan & Iraq in illegal war! Alqaeda hasn't been proved to have done the 9/11 and regarding Hezbollah well they are protecting their land. Wouldn't you protect your homeland if it got invaded, IDIOT   !

Sadaam who actively killed Kurds is better than America? Imperialistic Sadam who invaded countries is better than America? Regarding the legitimacy of the war see the post I linked you to. America the government that prosecuted those responsible for Abu ghraib? Al Qadea have admitted it and there is evidence linking them to it, what more do you need? So, you're ok with protecting your homeland with any means necessary?  Look  at some of the acts they have commited.

Because it is my country plus Im not ashamed being ashamed of the actions on behalf of Britain.
 
 
 
I wasn't talking about invading a country, I merely suggested that we should 'stop' the regime from acquiring a nuclear weapon; a weapon that could potentially crush a rebellion in a matter of minutes; a weapon that could potentially wipe an entire city from the surface of the earth. Ahmadinejad's 'wiping Israel off the face of the earth' quote may have been misquoted, however, the intention was clearly there. Now, are you seriously suggesting that we allow a bunch of islamofascist, murdering rapists to acquire a nuclear weapon?

 

Stalin i see your still a warmongerer. How is it that you are the only one who still believes the bull about the intentions of th invaders in Iraq and Afghanistan. you seem to be intelligent but stop short of common sense and very cleverly deny any evidence which negates anything that you have said. Are you a Zionist? This will explain alot because they are a cunning lot and vicious to say the least

Have a little read of this and tell me what you think. Its 1933 and a deal is about to be made... What comes next do you think?

And who do you think this is?

Well you scoundrel punch your way out of this paper bag. Admit to your allegiance to Zionst sentiments and the implantation of fear amoung good people so that your own vicious tatse of war is met.
 
 
 
Not only is this not true, but we should be warning the world about Israel's nukes. Yes, the attempt is to do as was done to Iraq.

Yes you better believe it. Al Quada does not exist never has done and never will do except on your tv sets. But wait! what do we have here? A tv program admitting there are no terrorists! This cannot be true its obviously one of those marginal alternative conspiratorial stations run by the Taliban itself. No.......it’s the BBC!

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-hYorNi0nA&NR=1 

why is it that people want a nightmare to be true. Is it because they have loved ones who have gone to another country to kill innocent people as soldiers and feel compelled to blame people who wear towels on their heads? or is it because they are simply sadistic and have played too many war games on their Play stations. Whatever or whoever you are you may need to be sectioned because you have lost the plot and will death and destruction to others including the wholesale death to children, babies, women and homes destroyed to protect them from the nightmare you so happily wish to spread.

There are some of you who need to switch on your lightbulb.. and soon.

there are some people who believe students live in a bubbble and are too intellectually vain to see the obvious prefering to become disengaged from objective reality. In fact, a son of a very famous politician told me what his dad once said. He claimed students were "useful idiots" and attempt to achieve a level of psycho babbel to prevent them from figuring out the obvious.

Of course, "there are some who do this on purpose" he said, "because they have an agenda."

Which are you, dear boy?

Honestly, it seems like you have no clue what you are talking about. You can't even spell 'bubble' correctly.
 
 
 
Because it is my country plus Im not ashamed being ashamed of the actions on behalf of Britain.

 

If it's your country you should at least lean how to spell it's language correctly.

And it's very hard to take you seriously after you defended the Taliban.

I still can't understand how as a women you're not ashamed of yourself.
 
 
Iran's current leader is a self professed west hater. They punish people for even writing about the good things the west offers. They are removing westernised corses from there education system for being "un-islamic".

Don't get me wrong the west have raped resources round the world for decades. Im english and were the worst offenders for that (and im not appolagising, some of my family have died for these causes. unlucky to the rest for not being as good at war-fare as the brits).

Yes we created nuclear weapons, we realise there very very dangerous and thats why we have programs to slowly decommision them. Hence we dont want other countries to have them.

unstable nations are the last people we want to have nukes. ideally no one would have them at all, including ourselves.

The west even offered to pay for russia to enrich and build there nuclear power station, Iran said no, there enriching material to a higher level than requiered hence we sanctioned them. I can smell a war coming on, which would probably be backed by the countless people which there current regime has raped of there fredom.

The state rules everything, and kills you if you dont comply. I can't imagine Allah in all his magnificence would ever want that to happen.

I wish we had backed there old leader when the revalution went on. maybe then we wouldnt have the problems of today.

Iraq and Afghan where wars we never should have gone to. personally i think we should have wiped out sadam when we threw them out of kuwate. we also had the backing of all the arab nations to do so at that time.

Up your viva!

Britain is spelled as BRITAIN!
And secondly I don't support terrorist neither the the Taliban or Israel!
I'm just saying under the Taliban those people killed by the Western army would have be alive so therefore the Taliban is the lesser of the evil.
There are much worser countries than Taliban such as Israel that kill innocent people on daily basis and abused them and have an apartheid regime going on! They discriminate against children going to school and deny medical etc.
So old man, don't make assumptions about me if you dont know me!
 
 
 
And secondly I don't support terrorist neither the the Taliban or Israel!

 

So you support either the Taliban or Israel, because that was a double negative.

Basic grammar tip: Neither....nor. (not or)

And you were told a hundred times already that the Taliban killed more civilians than NATO forces ever did, yet somehow it fails to get through to you.

 
There are much worser countries than Taliban such as Israel that kill innocent people on daily basis and abused them and have an apartheid regime going on! They discriminate against children going to school and deny medical etc.
 

The bold part is exactly why I said you need to learn how to spell. In this case grammar.

Now, under the Taliban women were denied education, medical attention, work, and basically could not set their foot outside their home without male escort. Not to mention many women were publicly executed without trial for adultery, men were beaten up in the streets for not having a long enough beard, Hazara's suffered racial discrimination and so on.

You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You just heard the words Afghanistan, Taliban and America in some random context and decided that the Taliban were better.

So no, Israel is not worse. Israel is much better.

 
So old man, don't make assumptions about me if you dont know me!
 

I know you're not the sharpest tool in the shed.
 
 
 
Wow you so thick its unbelievable. Israel is not open about its nuclear weapons nor has it ever used them to threaten any other country or in fact even acknowledged their exsitance.

Iran having nukes will lead to a massive nuclear arms race between all the middle Eastern countries. You really seem to have not even a basic understanding of the politics of the middle east.

 

Sorry but Israel is a vacious evil country but it has good people who live there which is not the same thing. Israel is not much different to Nazi Germany in fact what was a Jew doing trying to award Hitler with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1933?

While you are at it, you might learn how to spell as well - but that is secondary.

Of course, the past masters of government sponsored terrorism were the Zionists, who created the condition in the Arab countries, and in some European countries to stampede the Jewish populations out of the countries they had been living in for many hundreds years and get them into a Zionist state.

The evidence, not I, will convince you of the truth of this issue...Exposing the Zionist role in the [Nazi] era is part of the scrutiny of the past, required of historians.” but I am unclear weather the blindness you are displaying is due to a dry technical soulless education you have received or you are just a deceiver to dismiss the obvious in return for....

Avraham Stern, the leader of the notorious “Stern Gang,” late in 1940, made a written proposal to Hitler, by which the Jewish militias in Palestine, would fight on “Germany’s side,” in the war against England, in exchange for the Nazis help in resolving the “Jewish Question” in Europe, and their assistance in creating an “historic Jewish state.” By this date, German troops had already marched into Prague, invaded Poland, and had built the first concentration camp at Auschwitz. The deranged Stern had further bragged about how the Zionist organizations were “closely related to the totalitarian movements of Europe in [their] ideology and structure.” Stern’s obscene proposal was found in the German embassy, in Turkey, after WWII.

It later became apparent to many scholars that our history books would be written omitting the dark secret that is the intrinsic link between the State of Israel and the megalomaniac known as Adolf Hitler. It is therefore no surprise that the same fingerprint currently left behind by the actions of Nazi Germany is not dissimilar to the one Israel leaves behind after each terrorist action carefully and outrageously past off as
Muslim terrorism.

So today we have Israel with assassins who shoot people in bars or on the streets of London, who dress up as Al Quada operatives to spread hatred while being filmed by CNN, We have people raped, murdered and imprisoned just to allow for this madness that is Zionism to continue

What a great plan because today Jews feel safe from the very madness given to them by their masters who are the architects of all the shame and horrors we see in our newspaper day after day. But don’t stop there, the fear is no different to the one being pipelined into the heads of children man and women all around you.

So Iran has nuclear weapons do they? So what?? It seems Hitler built Israel and you know this but use ignorance as a weapon to fool others. You are an idiot and right now luckily there are many students who openly protest against the vile actions of the loose canon that is Israel.

So is this eveil or is it evil?
 
 
 
Of course, the past masters of government sponsored terrorism were the Zionists, who created the condition in the Arab countries, and in some European countries to stampede the Jewish populations out of the countries they had been living in for many hundreds years and get them into a Zionist state.

The evidence, not I, will convince you of the truth of this issue...Exposing the Zionist role in the [Nazi] era is part of the scrutiny of the past, required of historians.” but I am unclear weather the blindness you are displaying is due to a dry technical soulless education you have received or you are just a deceiver to dismiss the obvious in return for....

So did Avraham Stern ever work with the Nazis after he realized that the Nazis were committing genocide against the Jewish people?

Here is an interesting image for you, it shows the old mufti of Jerusalem - Arafat's uncle:
