Strongman Yang Zhe gifted China their first gold medal in men's 105kg
weightlifting in 12 years at the Guangzhou Asiad here on Friday.

The 19-year-old Yang snatched 185kg and jerked 217kg to earn a winning total of
402kg, followed by Efremov Ivan of Uzbekistan at 400kg. Istomin Sergey of
Kazakhstan settled for the bronze at 396kg.

China didn't win gold in the last two Asiad in heavyweight weightlifting after
Cui Wenhua won the men's 105kg at Bangkok Asiad in 1998, a huge gap comparing
with its traditional strengths of light and middleweight, where the country
gained four golds and one silver at the Beijing Olympics.

"Now my aim is the world champion. I will fight for the London Olympics," said
Yang with a smile.

Talking the performance of Yang, his coach Wang Guoxin said that "his style is
similar to Cui, who is very hard-working. But frankly speaking, he is not as
powerful as Cui".

Yang took a 3kg-lead by snatching 185kg. In the clean and jerk he failed at
219kg before lifting 217kg. As Ivan and Sergey failed at 223kg after jerking
218kg and 216kg respectively, Yang secured the gold.
