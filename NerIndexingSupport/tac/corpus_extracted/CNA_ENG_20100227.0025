plot of public land in Taipei City was sold for NT$731 million (US$22.74
million) in a public auction Thursday. The unit price of NT$6.03 million per
ping is the second-highest unit price for residential land ever recorded in
Taiwan.

As the public is complaining about unaffordable housing prices, whether the
National Property Administration's (NPA's) decision to sell public land at this
time is fueling surging real estate prices or contributing to the property
bubble has become a focus of concern.

The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:

China Times:

Finance Minister Lee Sush-teh said the sale of the public land accounts for only
a fraction of all land sold in Taiwan and urged the public to be rational and to
respect the market mechanism.

The NPA defended its decision too, saying that if it does not sell land to meet
the needs of the private sector, it would be a "waste."

The release of public land through market mechanism helps spur economic
development, it continued.

It said the use of national land is based on the principle of "public land for
public use" and that it gives priority for the use of the central and local
governments.

The NPA said it also follows the policy of "selling small pieces of land but
keeping the large ones, " and has sold only public plots of less than 500 pings.

It also said public sales account for a negligible share of the domestic real
estate market.

Citing 2009 sales, the NPA said the 13.85 hectares of public land it auctioned
off last year for NT$10.8 billion accounted for only 0.04 percent of all the
land sold in Taiwan and 0.68 percent of the total transaction value of NT$1.58
trillion.

It explained that in the sales, the few that fetched exorbitant prices were
invariably located in Taipei City, which is mainly because Taipei City is an
index area of economic development and the available land is now decreasing.

United Daily News:

Real estate businesses think the government should suspend the sale of public
land for the time being to dampen the overheated housing market and help the
sound development of the property market.

Chang Hsin-ming, president of the Pacific Assets Management Co., said that
obtaining land in urban areas has become more difficult in recent years and that
public land has become a shortcut for developers.

Some bidders often scramble to buy small pieces of land near public land and
await their chances to get windfall profits.

Chang noted that once public land in one area fetches a good price, other
construction projects and even second-hand houses in the area will ride on the
coattails and see price surges.

Tamkang University professor Chuang Meng-han said public land sold by the NPA
has continued to set record prices, which will whip up panic among the public
that if they do not act quickly to buy a house, they will never be able to
afford one.

The public land sold by the NPA over the past two years has mostly fallen into
the hands of the conglomerates, and the prices have continued to set records, he
said.

If the government wants to return to the fundamentals of housing prices, he
suggested that it suspend sales of public land to cool the market.

Liberty Times:

Land Bank of Taiwan  Chairman  Wang Yao-hsin  said it is "outrageous" to see one
ping of land being sold for over NT$6 million.

Wang took the NPA's approach to task, saying that the bidding for land in Taipei
City has lost all rationality.

The NPA should not stimulate land price hikes through its public land sales. He
also said land priced at over NT$6 million per ping is beyond the risk
management of a bank and that his bank will never undertake such financing.
