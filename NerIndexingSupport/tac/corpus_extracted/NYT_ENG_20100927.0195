Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has notified customers that it will
drop its
Medicare Advantage health insurance program at the end of the year,
forcing
22,000 senior citizens in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine
to seek
alternative supplemental coverage.

The decision by Wellesley-based Harvard Pilgrim, the state's
second-largest health insurer, was prompted by a freeze in federal
reimbursements and a new requirement that insurers offering the
kind of
product sold by Harvard Pilgrim - a Medicare Advantage private fee
for
service plan - form a contracted network of doctors who agree to
participate for a negotiated amount of money. Under current rules,
patients
can seek care from any doctor.

"We became concerned by the long-term viability of Medicare
Advantage
programs in general," said Lynn Bowman, vice president of customer
service
at Harvard Pilgrim's office in Quincy. "We know that cuts in
Medicare are
being used to fund national health care reform. And we also had
concerns
about our ability to build a network of health care providers that
would
meet the needs of our seniors."

Under Medicare Advantage plans, the federal government pays
private health
insurers to sell customers over 65 years old enhanced policies,
many of
which offer prescription drug coverage not covered by standard
Medicare.
But the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has been
seeking to
reduce the amount it pays to private insurers for such programs.

Medicare told Harvard Pilgrim to notify customers that its
Medicare
Advantage program, known as First Seniority Freedom, was being
canceled. In
a mailing, the insurer was required to list alternative Medicare
Advantage
plans, including those offered by its competitors.

Harvard Pilgrim in a second mailing this week will urge
customers to
switch to a new Medicare Supplement plan it will begin offering in
October.
Unlike Medicare Advantage, which is overseen by the Centers for
Medicare
and Medicaid Services, the new Harvard Pilgrim plan will be
overseen by the
Massachusetts Division of Insurance.

It will be "slightly more expensive" than the Medicare
Advantage plans,
but competitive with supplemental insurance plans offered by rivals
such as
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the state's largest health
insurer, Bowman said.

She said the Medicare Supplement plan will feature some benefits
not
covered by the current plan, such as fitness reimbursements, but
won't pay
for prescription drugs, which are covered by some versions of the
current
plan. Instead, seniors can buy separate supplemental drug coverage
through
a partnership with Coventry Health Care, in Bethesda, Md.

As of Monday afternoon, about 1,000 customers had sought
information about
the product change.

Newton resident Robert Gray, 68, a retired computer engineer and
technology researcher, said he was disturbed to find out his plan
was being
discontinued. But he said he prefers to remain with Harvard Pilgrim
because
he is a longtime customer.

"If there's a big increase in price or the various options in
the new
plan don't seem to be the same ... we might consider going to
another
plan," Gray said.

More than 60 percent of senior citizens in Massachusetts are
covered only
by Medicare, according to Harvard Pilgrim research. Those who buy
supplemental insurance are divided roughly evenly between Medicare
Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans.
