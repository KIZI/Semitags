Chinese shares broke a five-day rally and fell Wednesday as profit-taking investors turned cautious.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 42.94 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 3,428.50. The Shenzhen Composite Index for China's smaller second exchange lost 0.5 percent to 1,144.14.

Investors took profits, especially on blue chips, but optimism that drove the rally is unabated, said Chen Huiqin, an analyst for Huatai Securities in the eastern city of Nanjing.

"This is a technical adjustment. Blue chips have surged too much," Chen said. "Optimism about the fundamentals of the economy and liquidity hasn't changed."

The Shanghai benchmark has risen by about 90 percent this year on a surge in bank lending to support Beijing stimulus spending. Some of that money is believed to have flowed into the market, helping to boost share prices.

PetroChina Ltd., Asia's biggest oil and gas producer, lost 2.1 percent to 15.67 yuan, while China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, the region's biggest refiner by volume, dived 4.7 percent to 14.7 yuan.

Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., China's biggest steelmaker, waned 4.3 percent to 9.55 yuan, while Angang Steel Co. tumbled 4.9 percent to 17.59 yuan.

Banks fell further after the industry regulator Tuesday said it will review capital adequacy, which might squeeze profits. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China's biggest commercial lender, declined by 1 percent to 5.23 yuan. Bank of China Ltd. gave up 1.1 percent to 4.54 yuan, while China Construction Bank Ltd. shed 0.9 percent to 6.36 yuan.

In currency markets, the yuan strengthened to 6.8310 to the U.S. dollar, up from Tuesday's close of 6.8372.
