Any Dallas, TX Lisp hackers out there interested in starting a users'
group?  I can't find any evidence for an existing group and the last
call for one seems to be from 2003.  Meetup.com (http://
lisp.meetup.com/cities/us/tx/dallas/) offers three other interested
individuals, but a few more would make things much more stable.

Thanks.
