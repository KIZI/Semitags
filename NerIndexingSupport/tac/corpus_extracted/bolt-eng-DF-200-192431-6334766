Michael Mcintyre?

You sir, are a bastard, this man deserves his own religion he is so awesome.

This appears to be a controversial topic lol.
 
 
Jeremy Kyle. He's so bloody arrogant and self-satisfied, and has absolutely no right to be. I don't care whether his show is entertaining (?); given his own person record of relationships, he has even less right than anybody else to lecture people on staying faithful to their partner.
 
 
Russell Howard shouldn't be on there, the man broke fingers in the effort of trying to make us laugh!
 
 
Dunno why Piers Morgan is hated so much
 
 
Hamster? WTF dude? Richard Hammond is awesome.
THIS is a face that i'd pay good money to drive a lawn mower over;

 
 
 
 
 
 
I agree most with Piers Morgan, absolute absolute BELL! All four of the Inbetweeners are dying for a smashing, and Morrissey.
 
 
 

What do you do and why do people pay you to do it? Just do us all a favour and disappear. How he still has a career and hasn't had to turn to gay porn I do not know.

Pretty much all of the eastenders cast deserve a punch too. Since when did having a cockney accent mean you can act? TV License should not pay those ****tards wages.
 
 
Jeremy Kyle fo' sure!
 
 
piers morgan--- he should be deported
 
 
Piers Moron, David Cameron, Paul Merton.

He lives in America.
 
 
 

Not only is his face punchable, I'd also happily run it over with a tank.

Jeremy Kyle for being a MASSIVE pussy.

Stands there, judges people, has a go at them for mistakes, attemmpts to belittle them, acts hard, then quickly jumps behind his 95 million security guards when someone gets shirty. He's like the little dick at school who starts stuff then hides behind his older brother when you try and have a go at him. Frustrating as hell.

If I ever hear his voice getting all high pitched again I swear I'm gonna find out where he lives and kick his ****ing teeth in.

 
I honestly don't understand why he is famous. There is something wrong with the British media if d**kheads like this are not banned from appearing on telly.

He's a smug little git, who goes too far and takes the piss out of things he shouldn't.
If i ever see him cracking jokes about other people, or sensitive subjects i think :
"who the hell does he think he is?".
Just a arrogant Scottish bloke who thinks the sun shines out of his arse. I wouldn't shed the slightest bit of sympathy if he was bagged up and thrown off the empire state building.
What.A.Knob

Takes things too far? Too far for what? A joke can't simply be 'too far' - it has to be too far for a particular purpose. Are you saying he takes it too far with respect to a measurable and objective limit, or just too far for your personal comedic tastes? Because if it's the latter, nobody cares.
 
 
 
 
 
When I saw the title, Immediately thought "Harry M! Nobody would dare say a guy who has had 5 hours of TV would even be considered! I'll say him!"

Watch that. Having a dig at someone who has deceased and can't defend themselves is bad enough, but for someone like Princess Diana - scum like Frankie Boyle have NO right to do that.
She did more good in the world than he will probably ever do.

I was watching him on Jonathan Ross where he described Andrew Lloyd Webber's face "as if it had been half cut off by a diseased butcher and then piped back on again".
Ok, that's not offensive to me - but again, why is he having a dig at these people? What right does he have?

I just think he's a vile human being, that's all.
 
 
 
why is he having a dig at these people?

 

Because he has the righteous fury of youth on his side

Ever heard of freedom of speech?

People get offended at subjective things, I'm sure you won't even flinch when listening to his jokes about catholic priests or maggie thatcher..
 
 
This one gave me heart problems when I saw him posturing on TV a few weeks ago.

He has said worse than that, as have more major comedians like Jimmy Carr, yet you've been remarkably silent with regards to him.

But in what sense is he going to far? If you're basing this rant on your own personal opinion you should at least say so, rather than acting as though he has breached some objective limit with his jokes. Also, he has every right to do that by law, and you're yet to clarify the standard by which you're making these bold claims. You need to explain in what sense he doesn't have the right to make these comments. He has the right by law, and I know of no other system that you could be basing these seemingly baseless comments on.

Mate i just answered the thread, of the most punchable face in my opinion.
I'm just looking forward to the day he gets violently assaulted on TV, then i bet he wouldn't be as smug. Infact, aren't you surprised he hasn't been beaten up yet?

Jimmy Carr has said much worse than Boyle, made light of far bigger issues of suffering than Andrew Lloyd Webber's face, yet you've been remarkably silent with regards to him. And you still haven't clarified by which standard you're claiming that he has gone too far. You just sound a little shocked at the idea of a comedian taking a line that isn't the family-friendly McIntyre route.

And no, I'm not shocked. Katie Price did a little sympathy-seeking publicity nonsense when he told his joke about Harvey, but that's the closest anybody has come to an attack as far as I know.

I saw most of the last episode for the first time and the one I found really irritating was the moody Irish one. Harry M did seem overly confident, but then that's not really a negative thing and he seemed to do fine.

Or has he been particularly annoying in previous episodes?

I haven't watched Jimmy Carr, is he any good?
I much prefer family friendly McIntyre route yes, i've never really liked controversial comedy - except Gervais at times.
Some of his stuff i literally can't understand how anyone is sick enough to find it funny, like his jokes on the holocaust and downs syndrome. I bet if he had a kid that was born with downs syndrome he would realise how much of an incentive tosser he is being.

From this and your previous comments, it has become clear that you believe that Frankie Boyle should be publicly hung (at least in rhetoric) simply because you personally are not a fan of his comedy. I'm not a fan of McIntyre's comedy, so you would concede that he should be publicly hung (again, at least in rhetoric) simply because I don't like his stuff? By logic wouldn't every public figure be dead (for a final time, at least in rhetoric)?

Also, you described the trait of finding certain jokes funny as 'sick' - what standard are you using to make this claim? You say it's sick, and I disagree. Simply stating a proposition doesn't make the proposition true. It remains your opinion and nothing more.

Yes James is annoying, but Harry M is the most stuck up pretentious little worm on the show by several thousand miles. He's been terrible the entire show and pretty much everyone who's worked with him on the team finds him atrocious aswell

I agree with Alan Carr. I don't want to post his image though as looking at it makes my blood boil.

Also, Joshua Radin:

 

I was particularly angry at his cover of Elliott Smith's Between The Bars. I'm not saying you have to think this is a great song, but it does seem like it came out of genuine misery, and seeing Joshua Radin with his arrogant little smile singing the words happily is infuriating.

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL! You've got jokes.
I'm glad you put Ben Mitchell. As I was scrolling down I was thinking "Ben should beon this". And Michael Mcintyre! I hate that guy.

I cant think of anything off the top of my head but I too often say "I just want to punch him! grr", whilst watching TV so I will deffinitely be editing  

Syed from eastenders is anopther one. His mouth quivers and trembles. Argh it pisses me off!

Dappy from Ndubz annoys the hell out of me! I watched an episode of his reality show and was just like what the actual **** is up with this guy. He's actually embarassing. And its embarassing that people admire him or think he is any kind of representation of todays youth. I'm so glad Ndubz arent big in America (lol, and why would they be) because the thought thatg so many people will see this guy and think we're in any way associated with him scared me. I use slang often but I would never, ever ever turn up to a meeting (with a highly influential music exeutive !) talking like this "nah blud I aint on dis ting though. Allow it tho cuz. Thats bare moist".  
And the way he was sitting and how he conducted himself was a joke. Like, I was just thinking "is he for real?". And WHO the hell told him that his hat looks good, let alone with one flap up! If I would see any kids I knew in my area with that hat on (when he first started that craze), I would pull it off their head and tell them to fix up. That hat thing there was just...CRINGE!

I also wouldnt mind punching Louis walsh. His mouth also quivers.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

OMG Noel Edmonds. Dont even get me started! I cant even flick through the channels when Deal or No Deal is on because catching a glimpse of him raises bly temperature. I hate him. He's so ****ing annoying. And I hate the way he slyly tries to pressure every contestent to go all the way. He acts like he isnt involved in anyway but his attempts are blatant. And I ****ing hate when he is on the phone and has to share the stupid Banker's jokes like we give a ****k. And the jokes are dead anyway. AND one time he had the nerve to diss someone else's shirt. I was thinking say WHAT? Come again motherucker. The guy he insulted though came back at Noel who got punked. He just took it like a bitch whilst the audience laughed. I did enjoy the show and the concept but had to stop watching because it got to the point where I just want to throw things at my TV because of stupid Noel.
 
 
 
 

 

I actually love you. Rik Mayall is a legend.  
 
 
 
OH AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON BRUCE FORSYTH!!!!

 

No! Not Brucey! <3
 
 
 
Princess Diana was a whore. Hardly anything to be proud of.

 

I'm glad you have such conclusive knowledge of this. Says something about you perhaps.

You forget that Princess Diana's husband never showed her any affection (probably because he was far too busy with Camilla). It's funny how normal standards change when we're talking about someone famous, because if she were just an ordinary woman, no one would blink an eyelid (in fact, they might even feel sorry for her), given that her husband was himself having affair. Not only is that highly degrading, but it's a horrible situation to be in, and I don't blame her one little bit.

Are you saying he takes it too far with respect to a measurable and objective limit, or just too far for your personal comedic tastes? Because if it's the latter, nobody cares.

 

exactly. Also, it's just an act. He's obviously not like that in real life, the whole point of dark comedy is to not be afraid of saying offensive things...

Me neither, do you want to pick a new planet? I'll build the spaceship  
 
 
I find the new Ben Mitchell far more annoying than the original
 
 
It has to be Richard from Richard and Judy. That guy is just such an annoying prick!
 
 
 

Without a doubt.
 
 
My TV habits revolve almost entirely around cooking shows now, so my two;
   

My all time most hated tv personalities, I would happily punch either of them if I met them and accept the consequences. Plus just look at the left one, who wouldn't punch him?

WHAT?! i love Nigel Slater, but he can be annoying, but isnt every TV chef like that?

I despise him, the way he anthropomorphises everything and talks about ingredients loving each other and wanting to be together, it just makes my skin crawl! He makes some decent enough food, but he talks so much nonsense in his shows that I can't bring myself to watch him anymore.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Smug c***.

 
Her voice.. Her ****ing voice.

 
**** you Flo  

 

I would LOVE to punch them! In the vagina with my penis.
 
 
Katie Price.
 
 
Either Michael Mcintyre or Piers Morgan. Both smug gits.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All of the ones you've said and also Cristiano Ronaldo.

 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

That's my Top 5.

Admitedly i only watch his shows for the food, and it is nice. But yes he does seem to think ingredients get married and therefore makes the dish better. his descriptions are really weird but i dont care because his food tastes good.
 
 
 
 

 

Completely agree, never laughed at anything this guy has said. I like how he made a song about people from norfolk being inbred when hes from the west country which is just as renowned for it. (even though i've never heard anything about anyone being inbred and i'm pretty sure that would get around)

Haha I can't sit through the nonsense, it drives me insane XD

I thought of a third one(ish);
 

99% of the time he's great and he does some reallllly awesome food. As a judge on the great british menu? Bloody infuriating!

I know right. And literally half of his act seems to be "tell implausible stories in an exaggerated West Country accent and make funny faces and hope the idiots in the audience laugh."

Just seen the Alan Partridge photo, do you happen to be from Norfolk? hes one of these guys that just acts like a 10 y/o and then the insanely immature audience find stupid voices and facial expressions funny...

Sounds like a plan! Furthest away from Essex as possible please. As if I needed any more reason to be ashamed of living here...

Then I guess you deserve to be punched too

With a vagina? Or a fist? I'd prefer the former.

Whoa whoa whoa! Are you saying Alan Partridge... isn't funny?
 
 
Hugh Grant.
 
 
Everyone out of TOWIE, Geordie Shore, and Desperate Scousewives, including the mindless idiots who even thought of such shows. God help us all.
 
 
I never used to mind him before he went on X Factor, but:

 

And:

 

Fair enough with Gary Barlow, but getting judged on your talent by Amanda Holden is like, as Example said (about Alexandra Burke IIRC) a beauty pageant getting judged by Stevie Wonder. It's ridiculous.

Option 3: a penis

OH ****! just realised how that post could be misread! The second bit i was talking about Russell Howard. Not liking Alan Partridge is Treason in Norfolk!

Errrrrmmmm... Yeah, sure, OK, I might as well. When do you want to meet up?

Good, good. I was about to go sick and smash up my computer screen. But if you're talking about RH, that's fine, we got no beef, bro.
 
 
Astounded Cameron didn't make it into your wall of punchability.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

What! This guy is a saviour!!!

I kid i kid  
 
 
 

Surprised these two haven't appeared before now. Vile, loathsome creatures.
 
 
 
 

 

You made me laugh today  
 
 
 
Errrrrmmmm... Yeah, sure, OK, I might as well. When do you want to meet up?

 

I'm sending over Big Kev.. He'll see you right

Lovely stuff.

I can't even describe the things I would do to Brand. Violent isn't strong enough of a word.

As for the rest, pretty much everyone on BBC Three/E4/MTV/etc, and in fact, anyone with even a loose connection to those people.

David Cameron
Frankie Cokeupthenosa
Piers Morgan
Go Compare Man
Kelvin MacKenzie.

Special mentions to most of the people on the following: Jersey Shore, Geordie Shore, Made in (a TV studio in) Chelsea, The Only Way is Essex, Big Brother. Punching once would not be enough.
 
 
Go compare man
Michael McIntyre
Jeremy Kyle
All of X-Factor
All of TOWIE
All of Made in Chelsea
Janet Street Porter (taking extra care to avoid getting teeth in your knuckles)
Michael Moore

But if I was on my death bed, I would forego hugging my sobbing family to spend my last screed of strength punching Lee Evans in his weird, sweaty, chronically unfunny face.
 
 
i agree with the glee cast
 
 
the small guy from top gear deserves to get punched
 
 
 

Bill O' Reilly really is the most hateful human being ever spawned.
 
 
 
Michael Mcintyre?

You sir, are a bastard, this man deserves his own religion he is so awesome.

This appears to be a controversial topic lol.

 

Funny how you get negged on TSR for having an opinion...what you find funny is totally subjective and very personal, but that never stops the neg train!!!

P.s. I think we should start this MM religion...
 
 
 
 

The one and only Tim Westwood.

 

Ah yes. Tim "I think I'm black but I'm really not,izzle dizzle" Westwood... I'd say shot, and then ran over instead of punched though

Edit: Every T4 presenter would get the same treatment, even the women.

I really hate that T4 presenter - the mixed race girl... Is it Mika or something? She thinks she's sooooo ****ing funny and alternative she deserves a ****ing train to the FACE
 
 
Justin Bieber, each and every member of 1 Direction, The Wanted and JLS, Piers Morgan, Louis Walshe, Russell Kane, Kieth Lemon, Everyone in The Only Way is Essex and all the crap spinoffs e.g Desperate Scousewives etc... and I could probably think of more if I had more time.
 
 
The guy who does the J2O glitter berry advert. I despise him and the advert!
 
 
 
 
That bloody guy who sits on eggheads looking self-important.

 
 
And these 2 *****; especially Al Murray.
How anyone finds anything he says funny I do not know.

she's a smug cow, argh!

There are no words to describe how much I want to punch Piers Morgan.
 
 
Mark Zuckerberg.
 
 
I'd happy punch Wayne Rooney, he is an over-rated ugly dog, who is just better than the average football player and nothing more spectacular. I hate the media too for depicting him as some genius at football when he is a bag of rubbish, also the English pundits, i'll happily punch them too with immense force for fabricating on how good Rooney is, when frankly he is not.

Reality show casts in general. These people are literally getting paid to be alive. No talent or skill whatsoever and their petty squabbles are neither endearing nor entertaining.
