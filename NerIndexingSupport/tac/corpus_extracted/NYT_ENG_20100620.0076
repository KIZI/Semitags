To thousands of homeowners whose loans have been shuttled from
one company to another, the name "Bryan Bly" is very familiar.

Over the past few years, Bly has signed countless mortgage
assignments as either a notary public or "vice president" of
various lenders.

In reality, Bly works for Nationwide Title Clearing, a Palm
Harbor company. And he was recently reprimanded by state regulators
after acknowledging in a sworn statement that Nationwide Title had
him notarizing so many documents that he scribbled his initial
instead of signing his full name as required by law.

Such a pace, critics say, shows that Bly and other so-called
"robo signers" can't possibly be sure that what they're signing
is accurate.

"Our entire system of real estate is founded upon the ability
of courts to believe in the documents before them," says Matthew
Weidner, a St. Petersburg lawyer who has a blog on foreclosure
issues. "What this (Bly's statement) describes is assembly-line
document production with no concern for the facts in front of
them."

Bly's name has become well known in the foreclosure defense
field since the St. Petersburg Times reported last year that he and
Crystal Moore signed thousands of mortgage assignments as officers
of Option One and other lenders even though both work for
Nationwide Title.

Assignments are key in determining who actually owns a mortgage,
an all-important matter as banks foreclose on loans that were
bundled into securities and sold to investors. To expedite the
processing of mortgage assignments, many banks authorize Bly, Moore
and others at Nationwide Title to sign on their behalf.

In a statement Friday to the Times, Nationwide Title said it
employs "many people" in various departments "to make sure that
each and every document is legal, compliant and complete" when it
reaches signers like Bly and Moore.

The company also said that it serves banks around the country
and "is subject to their due diligence and quality control audits
on a regular basis."

The 2009 Times story caught the attention of Samuel Smart, a
Naples homeowner whose loan has changed hands twice.

"The real concern I have, if I were to sell my house, who can
legitimately sign off on my mortgage?" Smart said.

Last year, when MoreEquity Inc. transferred his loan to another
company, Smart noticed that the mortgage assignment was signed by
Crystal Moore as vice president of MoreEquity and notarized by Bly.
However, Bly signed with only a B and not as "Bryan J. Bly," the
signature approved by the state.

Florida law says: "Once commissioned, the notary must sign
precisely as commissioned by the state of Florida, in the exact
name appearing on your notarial commission certificate."

Smart complained to Gov. Charlie Crist's office, which regulates
notaries. Asked to respond to the complaint, Bly submitted a sworn
statement that gave a glimpse into the workings of Nationwide Title
Clearing.

"Depending on the needs of NTC's customers, there were
sometimes thousands of such documents to be notarized in a single
day," Bly's statement said. "On those days, I would typically be
notarizing documents for many hours."

Bly said he noticed that other NTC employees whose names
appeared on documents as vice presidents or witnesses were signing
"only with their initials and sometimes squiggles that barely
approximated initials."

"Over time," Bly continued, "the notarial signature I affixed
to those documents became progressively shorter and shorter until
at last I was merely signing B. I was not, at the time, aware that
this could be characterized as a violation of state law."

Bly's statement said that on May 5, 2009  two days after the
Times story ran  Nationwide Title was told by its legal counsel
that Florida law prohibits notaries from signing with anything but
their commissioned signature. Bly said he tried to change his
signature to the shorter B. Bly, but couldn't until his notary
commission expires in 2011.

As a result, he said, he was reassigned to a job that doesn't
involve notarizing documents.

This year, the governor's office notified Bly that it had put a
"formal reprimand" in his file that would be reviewed "if other
complaints are filed against you for notary misconduct."

Smart calls it a slap on the wrist.

"It's yet another example that government regulation is lax or
totally lacking," said Smart, who owns a glass and mirror company.
"The state kind of sanctioned him a little bit but didn't even
pull his license."

Weidner, the St. Petersburg lawyer, said it is unlikely that an
improper notary signature on a mortgage assignment would be enough
to void a final judgment of foreclosure.

But "I think that catching that fact before a judgment is
issued is certainly enough to prevent them from getting a
judgment," he said.

As the foreclosure rate soars, more and more judges are
questioning documents put before them. According to the transcript
of a recent hearing, Pinellas Circuit Judge Anthony Rondolino noted
that the same individual alleged the same set of facts on
affidavits filed in two different foreclosure cases. The only
change was that the individual claimed to be a director of one
company on one affidavit and director of another company on the
second affidavit.

"That really increased my interest in this subject matter,"
Rondolino said, "because  I don't have any confidence that any of
the documents the court's receiving on these mass foreclosures are
valid."

(Rondolino was speaking in general, not referring to Nationwide
Title Clearing or any specific company.)

In his new job with Nationwide Title, Bryan Bly has signed as
"attorney in fact" for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
took over IndyMac Bank last year and has been assigning its loans
to other lenders. Some of Bly's notary duties have been assumed by
colleague Crystal Moore, who got her notary commission in
September.

Moore's state-approved signature assures that she can sign
quickly but legally. It's just the initials CM.
