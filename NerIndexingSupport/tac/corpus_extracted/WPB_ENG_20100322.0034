For the second time this year, the Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid by
Michigan to force the closure of Chicago-area locks and dams, a step the state
contends is needed to keep Asian carp from entering Lake Michigan.

The justices refused to order Illinois and federal officials to take a number of
steps to prevent the fish from infiltrating the Great Lakes, where they might
damage the region's fishing and tourism industries.

The high court rebuffed a similar bid by Michigan in January. The state renewed
its request after the Army Corps of Engineers reported finding Asian carp DNA in
Lake Michigan.

The Obama administration and Illinois urged the Supreme Court not to intervene,
arguing that they are already stepping up their fight to keep the fish from
reaching Lake Michigan.

The dispute has divided the Great Lakes region. Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York,
Pennsylvania and Ontario have all backed Michigan at the Supreme Court.
