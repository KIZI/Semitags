Mormon church president Thomas S. Monson has announced plans to build five new temples in the U.S. and abroad.

Monson says the temples will be built in Hartford, Connecticut.; Indianapolis; Tijuana, Mexico; Urdaneta, the Phillippines; and Lisbon, Portugal.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints already has 134 temples operating worldwide, most in the U.S. Another 16 temples are either planned or already under construction.

Monson's announcement came Saturday during the opening session of the church's two-day semiannual general conference in Salt Lake City.

The new temples will be the first for the church in Connecticut, Indiana and Portugal.
