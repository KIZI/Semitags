 
 
I am a Jealous God
 
 
I often like to skim through the bible, it's quite interesting. I sometimes come across a sentence that makes me feel the same way the quran makes me feel. There is probably one of these in every two chapters. But I had never read anything in the bible that I strongly dislike-- but this paragraph made me think.
1 And God spoke all these words:
2 "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
This is a warm, lovely sentence which reminds us of the story of moses. It is one of those sentences that you can actually, sincerely, believe.

3 "You shall have no other gods before [a] me.
Fine, this should include Mary ofcourse then-- you cannot worship her

4 "You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. 5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments.
Ok, first "don't make yourself an idol..." this means no stupid jesuses on crosses-- I mean, I'm pretty sure the real Jesus was much prettier, better looking than most pictures and statues.
"You shall not bow down to them..." ok, no nuns bowing down to "jesus" and "mary".
Jealous God? I knew when I read this that this cannot be god's words, the Lord has not stupid manly feelings and emotions. He does not become jealous, agitated, uncomfortable or guilty. Does anyone agree with me?
 
 
Catholics don't worship Mary, if that's what you're implying (which you obviously are).

I am not concentrating on catholics with this thread. I am concentrating on the bible and christianity-- and maybe christians of today. I have seen in many cathedrales in spain, idols of mary and people worshipping her.
 
 
"I am a jealous God" might be an example of the slightly old-fashioned use of "jealous" to mean the same as "zealous", as when Elijah said "I have been very jealous for the Lord God of Hosts" (i Kings xix. 10).

Incidentally, I am surprised Elijah is not regarded as a prophet by Islam, the way Nuh, Ibrahim, Isma'il, Ishaq, Musa and Isa are. In my view Elijah was far more of a prophet than Ishaq or Nuh. He converted an entire country, for goodness' sake.

From what I know, Ilyas, which is the Arabic for Elijah, is regarded as a prophet, and one of the 25 mentioned in the Koran.
 
 
I often skim through it too, but I don't make those sort of observations.
 
 
OK, my mini-guide to Islam doesn't mention Ilyas and, being a non-Arabic speaker, I don't have the Noble Qur'an itself to turn to. My bad.
 
 
Basilisk, I think that Allah is just as jealous as Jhwh (ever heard of shirk?).

In any case, in Italian we say "Dio li fa, e poi li accoppia".(superficial translation: none is any better than the other)
 
 
it is best not to waste time criticizing other people's beliefs. the hardest thing is to change yourself for the better.

LOL

Actually, he probably didn't look much different to the thousands of people living in the area at the time, a time at which personal hygiene probably wasn't at its highest, and Toni and Guys only existed in the major cities.

God is best. Better than all-- hence the term "god".
Allah is not jealous-- he forbids (shirk) giving partners to Him because He has no partners and saying He does would be false. And God does not premote lies.

Ever heard of a miswak? It's a really effective toothbrush. Most of the prophets are said to have used one. Have you heard of wudu? Ablution? This was not introduced only at the time of Muhammad, it was introduced by all prophets. Cleanliness is obligatry in Islam. And Jesus was a Muslim.
 
 
Sorry, you're right, Jesus was cleaner than Kim and Aggie.

Jesus was a Muslim? What does it take to be a Muslim then? Being clean?
 
 
The bible for the most part uses the term zealous and jealous interchangably. In effect he is saying that he will punish the wrong doers and reward those who love him. God's jealousy/zealousy is righteous. It's not petty like man's.
 
 
With regards to Jesus being pretty: It's very likely that he was distinctly average. I forget the exact verse, and I don't have a bible to hand, but there is a passage that states that Jesus was made not unpleasing to the eye, but no more so than any other man, and no more alluring to women.

Submission to God's will.

And being clean helps.
 
 
So you can be a Muslim and not even realise? Cool.
 
 
Now I'm not sure if I explained well enough, but whatever...
 
 
Hang about... Jesus was a Muslim, a few hundred years before Mohammed even existed?
 
 
Muslims believe that the Holy Men of Judaism and Christianity were part of a long religious tradition that culminated in the advent of Islam.

Believing and worshipping Allah. Jesus may not have needed to say "...and muhammed is His messenger" he only needed to say "There is no God but God". But he would have known of muhammed for God would have told him of the coming of the last prophet. All the prophets were muslims, starting from Adam.  
2:140 Or do ye say that Abraham, Isma'il Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were jews or christians? Say: Do ye know better than Allah. Ah! who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from Allah. but Allah is not unmindful of what ye do!
 
 
Muslim:

"A muslim is a believer or followerer of Islam".

Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Islam involve quite a few things (like praying in Arabic) that would've seemed very odd in Israel?

I'm interested as to your proof that Jesus was a Muslim.

Just read the English version-- that's what I do. If you go on a website with three different translations, they're very reliable.

So I could be seen as a Muslim then? Because I worship Jehovah/God/Allah?

Don't be silly-- Islam at the time of jesus was different. As was Christianity and Judaism. Think about that.

No, because NOW to be a muslim you need to say "Muhammed is His messenger"

What's there to think about? Christianity didn't exist at the time of Jesus in any meaningful sense, and didn't even exist until the Gentiles started to believe (and to this day, there are still Messianic Jews who believe in Jesus, but don't identify as being Christians - which is fair enough)

And of course Judaism was different then - not knowing any Jews, I can't comment, but one blinding difference is that the Temple still existed in Jesus's day.

How was Islam different? Give me examples...

on the other hand, one would think that, having no partners, he would need a couple of buddies (or a good mate). In fact, polytheistic religions are much easier on god.

Muslims then were not the same as Muslims now. To be a muslim then you only had to follow which ever prophet God sent to guide you. But the Muslims before the prophet Muhammed would still say "There is no god but God and Muhammed is His messenger" because Jesus, Moses, etc. would have been told of the coming of the last prophet (his birth was one of the signs that the Hour is near)
For a much clearer picture--
2:253 Those apostles We endowed with gifts, some above others: To one of them Allah spoke; others He raised to degrees (of honour); to jesus the son of Mary We gave clear (Signs), and strengthened him with the holy spirit. If Allah had so willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among each other, after clear (Signs) had come to them, but they (chose) to wrangle, some believing and others rejecting. If Allah had so willed, they would not have fought each other; but Allah Fulfilleth His plan.

2:136 Say ye: "We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in Islam)."

3:52 When jesus found Unbelief on their part He said: "Who will be My helpers to (the work of) Allah." Said the disciples: "We are Allah's helpers: We believe in Allah, and do thou bear witness that we are Muslims.

4:157 That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah.;- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:-

4:163 We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms.

4:171 O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of Allah aught but the truth. Christ jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) an apostle of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in Allah and His apostles. Say not "Trinity" : desist: it will be better for you: for Allah is one Allah. Glory be to Him: (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.

5:46 And in their footsteps We sent jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.

Don't forget about using ONLY the left hand when going to the washroom and using an odd number of stones to clean yourself. Oh yeah and also not to breath in the glass or utensil when drinking water because all of these are considered to be unhealthy.

Well He has none as all are lesser than Him. Friends should be of the same status. But God is God. The Most High. He needs no company. He has no need.

  Exellent, who told you this? A handkercheif would also suffice but it is disrespectful to a woman so you should only use if you are really pissed off with her, eg. she has commited adultery, she won't talk to you, etc.

Surprising you say that when there's verses like this in the Hadiths:

"The Prophet said, 'When you eat, do not wipe your hands till you have licked it, or had it licked by somebody else."
Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 65, Number 366:

And this:
The Prophet said "If a house fly falls in the drink of anyone of you, he should dip it (in the drink), for one of its wings has a disease and the other has the cure for the disease."  
Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 54, Number 537

Then, why did he create us? did we ask for it? He was bored to death, so we provide for him a pleasant diversion. Especially watching us squirm in those flames.

not sure about knowing better than allah, but he made a big mistake in making the universe before he made me. i'd have given him some very handy advice before he started creating.

Well, Jesus wasn't clean in the personal hygiene sense of the word.

And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner. And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness. (Luke 11:37-39)

So the left hand has fewer germs, and the odd stone helps in the germ cleansing? Please, don't be ridiculous.

Of course. It also includes other gods such as lust, greed, gluttony etc.

Not sure if I should consider the words in the bold quite offensively. Obviously, none of know how Jesus looked like except as the Son of God, He was probably the most handsomest man ever. Now, if I have a crucifix with me, which I don't worship, I basically look at it to remind me of the sacrifice which God made. I am not praying to the crucifix or worshipping it.

Quite. It elevates the senses. That's one of the reasons why the Church (I'm talking here about the RC/Orthodox/Anglo-Catholics) is rich in liturgy. The sacraments, divine liturgies et al stimulate all five of the senses. That brings us closer to God.
 
 
Interesting Debate. Indeed 'Father Abraham had many sons'
 
 
I would have thought skim-reading the Bible would be better than not reading it at all. True, you might get things out of context, but one of the modern Bibles would have little notes to keep this to a minimum. Besides, without reading it lightly how is anyone ever going to get sufficiently interested in it to want to look deeper? Just because the goal is deep understanding, it doesn't follow that the first step on the road towards it should be viewed as somehow a bad thing.

I agree with the point about the crucifix, though. It's not for worshipping, it's a reminder. Just as the reverent treatment of Al-Qur'an is not worship of the Book itself, but a reminder of its holy content.

I suppose one reason for the Muslim lack of imagery could be a fear of just this issue: that the pictures themselves might become the focus of worship, rather than God.

Oh, one other thing - seriously, The Basilisk, how was Jesus a Muslim? I'm intrigued.

True... but you can get things out of context and totally misunderstand what is meant. For eg, I often find that some verses are quoted as Book 1:1a. They totally omit verse 1b which might be the crux of the whole matter. As long as this is a first step, it is fine... but if you come to deep rooted conclusions on the basis of that, it could lead to misinterpretations
 
 
That's what I meant about the little notes. Much as I mock the hip translations of the Bible, there is a happy medium between the archaic incomprehensibility of the KJV and Jesus being bangin', innit. One element of this happy medium is the sidelines that appear in some new Bible translations. They catch the eye (almost to the point of being distracting), and they have the bonus that even if you do not read the whole chapter/passage, the side-note will explain it all, taking full account of context. Of course, I am not suggesting that this is a substitute for the Bible itself. Far from it. But reading someone else's interpretation of a passage is a reasonable way to start thinking about forming one's own interpretations.

No, you were implying that Muslims are superstitious because we go to the toilet with our left feet and come out with our right feet. I just want to say that this is not superstition, it is a way of life. It has become a habit for me.

--------------
Well I really did not mean it to be offensive, but if the Bible allows pictures of Jesus, it is letting Jesus's face be abused by the hands of men. That's why I respect the bible for forbidding it. Can you not find another way to remember jesus-- perhaps a cross will suffice?

Superstition depends on one's opinion. You cannot say that someone who believes in witches is superstitious, for they may think you are superstitious for saying grace before eating.

I know we've deviated far from the original post but in the past you've mentioned that alot of the teachings we think are superstitious are put in place to help oneself from contacting germs and staying clean but how can you defend such a position when you have verses like this in the Hadiths:

The Prophet said "If a house fly falls in the drink of anyone of you, he should dip it (in the drink), for one of its wings has a disease and the other has the cure for the disease."
Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 54, Number 537

Teachings like these surely come in conflict with what you stated. So, what's the point when verses like the above completely destroy the objective of trying to stay clean.

Maybe the English translation of the bible was quite silly to say the word "jealous". I was hoping someone would say it was the fault of the translators and it wasn't literal, because the first part of the verse was superb... until the word "jealous"

This goes a long way to show the mentality of religion in general really. Because you need to have faith in your prophets and God you feel some desire to imbue them with qualities you deem important on a human level. Jesus could have been ugly as sin (ho ho), what difference does it make? I expect he had bad breath and long greasy hair. There are no photos to suggest his appearance was anything other than normal (and normal in those days wasn't pretty I'd imagine).

Edit: Anyway, there's been some pretty beautiful art with the theme of Jesus's death.  This  for example or  this  (which is much better in reality - well both are, but especially the last one.)

Exactly - the distinction is tenuous at best. Superstition and religion are both based on irrational beliefs - I suppose the main difference is that, with religion, that belief is intrinsically linked to a god of some sort, whereas the cause in a superstition is less specific. For example, Christians (and Muslims etc.) see the failure to believe in God as something which will land them in hell. A superstitious person may avoid walking under ladders because he considers it unlucky. Personally, I don't think that either approach deserves any more respect than the other.

I'm guessing she means putting other things before God. eg. gluttony, would be having food as your god. -having it as a top priority. Or it could be money, all you crave is money, you're obssessed by it, you adore it, you'd do anything (eg. work long hours, work overtime, steal) for it. That sort of thing.

 
Put it this way, if he isn't- what is he?
 

Jesus was Jewish. His parents were. And he was too, being the Jewish messiah. And he knew the old testament/law very well.

I think by 'jealous', God means that he wants exclusive loyalty/worship. Backed up by the fact that the commandment is about not having idols. God refuses to be worshipped alongside a whole lot of false gods, having created and blessed the hebrews, he expects them to worship him solely, w/o any bowing down to any idol.

I think jealousy is a part of love. If you have a boyfriend, and he says he loves you, but he also has 16 other girlfriends, doesn't that diminish the quality of the love he bears for you? Doesn't that mean he doesn't care as much if he can date 16 other girls? He may love you, but by paying respects to these other girls, it's certain you're not his ultimate priority. Isn't it likewise for the hebrews, if they have other idols they bow down to, false things.

Jealousy isn't some petty human thing. I think that if there wasn't that commandment, if God had just approved of the hebrews going off and worshipping idols, then their love wouldn't have been as genuine or faithful - and would have been diminished.

Why should God expect people to have other priorities before him, other idols to worship. Why shouldn't the creator of heaven and earth expect to be exclusively worshipped?

(That's just my interpretation.)

Anyway, good on you for reading the bible! I recommend the new testament too.

Er... Jesus wasn't the Jewish messiah. He is the messiah according to Christians. In fact, he did not fulfil many of the conditions that the Torah states a person must to be considered the messiah. Also, Jesus hardly knew the Torah (or old testement as you might prefer) well. In fact, he subverted and twisted much of Judaism to benifit himself. Thats why he was not popular with many Jewish people during his life, and one of the reasons why Jews reject him as the messiah today.

Once you've recovered from your mental spasm... I cannot tell you how Jesus looked like, that's my point-- no one can, so that's why I'm against images and idols made of him-- it gives you a false image based on nothing.

Religion is based on beliefs which are old and facinating and usually believable but Superstition is the fault of one's own mentality.
Religion therefore is much more precious and deserving of respect.

I believe that He is the Son of God, who died and rose again... he led to the foundation of Christianity, obviously.

It would be like saying that Buddha is a Muslim... or say, King David was a Muslim.

Many superstitions are very old and have a fascinating history. Religion is not "usually believable" - it's no less irrational than a belief in the power of the black cat. It's simply a more organised form of superstition centred on a particular divine being, with a highly developed tradition which lends it the cachet of respectability and "truth". Objectively speaking, religion is certainly not more precious or deserving of respect.

I think you should reverse the logical process: if it's considered as precious, and deserving of respect, it's a religion. If not, then, sorry, it's a superstition.Hard luck.

I think you have a point there. Presumably, though, only the opinions of those who are actually religious count in this context - if one person thinks something is precious and worthy of respect, it must be a religion, irrespective of what other people think. A truly objective test!

The Quran doesn't contain all the fundamentals!

Without the Hadiths Muslims wouldn't know how to properly clean themselves before prayers and they wouldn't even know how many prayer cycles constitute fulfillment of each of the daily prayers (salat). If I remember correctly praying 5 times a day is one of the 5 pillars of Islam and if one didn't know how to properly pray then it would be useless, wouldn't it?

You said that you don't really follow the Hadiths but I have you as saying:

You're very mistaken. If you'll remember, Jesus knew the Torah quite well. When he was 12 he taught the priests at the temple and they were amazed at his understanding of the law. He was not popular with Jews because the Jewish leaders had created a system of legalism that was never taught in the Torah.

It's like the story my teacher was telling us about a programmer friend of his: hotshot, making tons of money, offered assistant professorship at MIT; then, on one project, he didn't test his system thoroughly enough. It crashed and cost his company a crapload of money, and now he's waiting tables in his mom's restaurant. Or, the physicists who got kicked out for claiming they had cold fusion (simply because no one else could replicate their experiment - for all I know, they Might've had cold fusion!), and are probably driving taxis right now. If some doctor gives someone the wrong perscription, and his patients get sick majorly, do you know how many hospitals I think would be hiring him? Zero. Dipping a fly in is pretty bad in terms of the "wrong perscription".

I think you will find that the "system of legalism" you talk about it Rabbinic commentry such as the Talmud, Mishna, Gemara etc which is equal to the Tanakh in Judaism due to the chain of tradition (Moses received the Torah at Sinai and handed it on to Joshua, Joshua to elders, and elders to prophets, and prophets handed it on to the men of the great assembly). All of this combined equals the Torah as a whole. Therefore, Jesus was criticising areas of Judaism which Jews considered to be direct from God. Understandably this did not make him a very popular figure, and the idea of him being the messiah ridiculous.

There are many mistranslations in Hadeeth-- especially when in english. Urdu is one of the only safe translations it has and so I am intelligent enough to diffrenciate what is genuine from what is false.

No it isnt, buddas nothing to do with Jesus. I have been trying to say that being a muslim then is not the same as being a muslim now. We don't belive Jesus ever preached he was the son of god. We believe he was following Allah's command and guiding his people.
The Qur'an says "we strengthened him with the holy spirit" which means he was able to do miracles.
 
 
If Allah was guiding Him, why did Allah not encourage Him to spread Muhammad's message 600 years in advance?

Of course there are Jews and Sikhs - outnumbered by Jedi knights, however. Atheism is not a religion. The percentages refer to those who indicated a religious affiliation.

The point I wanted to make, however, is that you cannot define or measure religion in any objective way: the Jedi knight religion was a joke of course (even if, apparently, some people took it seriously and actually converted - or reverted?)

Hey guys,

First off, it doesn't get you anywhere to make comments about 'stupid jesuses'- not only does it look... well, weird, but also it doesn't make you appear like the most understanding bloke in town.

Secondly, the reference you use to prohibit images of Jesus are objectionable in your usage for several reasons: a) they are in fact referring to worshipping images (like the Israelites worshipping a golden calf), and Christians do not worship crucifixes nor was that ever their aim; b) the passage is as much a response to ancient polytheism as anything- therefore to extrapolate to a monotheistic, Abrahamic and 21st century faith is nigh-on impossible; and c) in Christian Theology Jesus is the "image of the invisible God" (Philippians 2) and therefore it is in Christ that we can 'see' God as much as He can be seen. Therefore, theologically, Christians are in no way acting contrary to the Deuteronomic commandments.

 
Jealous God? I knew when I read this that this cannot be god's words, the Lord has not stupid manly feelings and emotions. He does not become jealous, agitated, uncomfortable or guilty. Does anyone agree with me?
 

There is certainly nothing theologically wrong with God experiencing emotions, but even with this in mind it would be wise to take into account the clearly symbolic concepts being used- what are the Biblical authors trying to tell us about God by using human labels like 'wrathful' or 'jealous'? There is something deeper than just (rather bizarrely) labelling them as 'stupid'- if anything God made us with them, I'd be careful when you dismiss them so eagerly.

On a larger scale, though, Holding  notes  :

" The word for "jealousy" in this form is used less than half a dozen times in the OT, and always is used to describe God. Nowhere is this word described as a sin. A related word is used to describe a husband who worries that his wife is walking out on him (Numbers 5). Sarna (Exodus commentary, 110) notes that the root of the word means "to become intensely red" and that it can refer to ardor, zeal, rage, or jealosuly. Paul knows of a godly jealousy (2 Cor. 11:2), so is this a sin as we understand it? Jealousy is part of God's nature because it is demanded by who He is -- He is the only being who can indeed say He has a right to be jealous, since He is the only one who truly deserves utter respect and devotion. Malina in The New Testament World [126-7] adds that in the context of an honor-based world, jealousy was "a form of protectiveness that would ward off the envious and their machinations." It is a behavior that an honorable person is expected to "exhibit towards that which he or she is perceived to possess exclusive access." Thus for God to be jealous here is not a vice in context, but a supreme virtue and demonstration of His concern for Israel "

I suggest you go to that link and follow the URL cited, as well. It's quite interesting.

 
Jesus was a Muslim
 

Hm I am indeed quite familiar with this Islamic line. The rationality behind it is always the same- "a muslim is someone who submits to God, therefore all the characters in the Bible, including Jesus, is a Muslim".

Two dominant problems remain, however:

1) Jesus 'submitted to God', but which God? Such a simplistic, generalised view ignores the massive difference in Theology between the historically-dominant, Gospel-centered Christ of Christianity, and the Isa of Islam. Indeed, the Jesus of the New Testament is a Jew, with no concept of 'Muhammad' but rather a self-realised faith- it is, by all means, a faith of Christians not of Islam. Therefore to call Jesus a Muslim based on a submission to God ignores said differences thus calling into question whether Jesus even regarded 'Islam' (as we or Muhammad knew it) at all (hint- He didn't).

2) The rationality behind such an assertion is so weak and tenuous it could make anything, anything! 'Submission' to God is a fundamental aspect of all religious faith, but Muslims would not say that Hindus, Sikhs, spiritual Satanists and pagans are 'Muslims in disguise' (like Transformers, just less cool). Indeed, what if I worshipped a potato, and I thought that said potato is the Divine. This would make me a 'Muslim', even if the potato told me that Muslims were devils. It's so illogical. Most alarming, however, is that the logic could be used to anything. I'm going to define a computer as a box which illuminates light- does that mean any old shoebox with a Tesco's lightbulb popping out the front is a computer? I don't think so! Quite clearly, the Islamic line of thought regarding the 'Muslim status' of prophets and even Christ Himself is stretching if not snapping the boundaries of meaningful language.

Hey (or should that be 'Shalom'?),

I would hasten to disagree with you there. Indeed, if we consider the conditions to be that which was carried down in the Tanakh then Jesus did indeed fulfil them- however it is worth noting that Judaism has never been one single line of interpretation but has prided itself on diversity of meaning. Indeed, this means that we need to assess each view. So, for example, there is enough room in the Tanakh to illustrate a Messianic view that is one Messiah, two comings, one humble and the other victorious. In fact this view has surfaced in past Jewish traditions, either in part or in full. The question is this- how do you know that your particular interpretation of the Messianic promise is more logical than mine? Did Jesus really not fulfil your conditions? Is there room for a future fulfilment? Hm...

 
Also, Jesus hardly knew the Torah
 

I would completely disagree there, Jesus was a master at the Torah but also at the numerous Jewish traditions and 'sects'- He knew the theology of the Sadducees and He knew the rabbinic customs.

 
In fact, he subverted and twisted much of Judaism to benifit himself.
 

That's quite a hefty accusation- where's the beef?

 
Thats why he was not popular with many Jewish people during his life, and one of the reasons why Jews reject him as the messiah today.
 

Other than the thousands who followed Him, during and after His death?

Take care guys,

If they are, then what can some other interpretations be? I have yet to see any different translations.

And even if the translations don't do justice it's hard to believe that the main idea or point is soo skewed that it's misleading. After all, the muslims who translated them probably did so to get the main idea across to the readers or else it would have defeated the purpose.(to get the main idea across the reader) Wrong?

The beef, if you subscribe to the Jewish view, is Jesus' claims to fulfil various prophecies. Judaism does not regard these as legitimate. Let's look at this from the Jewish perspective.

The following are not my own beliefs, and to make this quite clear I will enter "Judaism mode" before I outline the argument.

[Judaism mode]
1. Jesus is not the Messiah.
2. Jesus claims to be the Messiah.
3. No-one who is not the Messiah can fulfil the prophecies.
4. Jesus claims to fulfil the prophecies.
5. Therefore, Jesus must be twisting the prophecies to fit, otherwise it wouldn't work.
[/Judaism mode]

I agree. Judaism has clear conditions that need to be met regarding the messiah, and Jesus did not fufil them (see  here  )
In fact, Jesus (or his followers) knew the fragility of their claims which is why they fabricated facts such as Jesus being from the Davidic line (he almost certainly wasn't).
I'm not saying that the Christian faith is lesser in any way than Judaism, but it is inaccurate to call Jesus the Jewish messiah. He is the Christian messiah only.
 
 
 
Originally Posted by Agent Smith

The model you illustrate is not actually saying anything, though. Let me re-write it this way-

1. I am not a man.
2. I claim to be a man.
3. No one who is not a man can have the attributes of a man.
4. I claim to be a man.
5. Therefore, I must be lying.

... Now, I may not be a critical genius, but this does not strike me as a logical model nor as commentating on anything at all. For example, premises (2) + (4) are in effect the same, but most worrying is that it merely asserts a position in premise (1) and runs with it- speaking nothing of falsehood or truth.

To bring this back to the 'Jewish belief' concerning the Messianic status of Jesus, just because they don't believe Jesus is the Messiah does not mean that He can't be.

And yes, I appreciate you don't adhere to this. I'm just saying that regardless of the model's existence it does not mean we can't assert Jesus as the Jewish Messiah.

(Of course, what is the 'Jewish' Messiah? It is the Messianic and anointed individual appointed by God in the Tanakh to rescue mankind in one form or another, a theological construct if you will. Therefore if Christians claim Jesus is the Messiah this undeniably denotes a 'Jewishness', you can't escape it. Either Jesus is the Messiah and therefore Jewish or He ain't, no 'Christian Messiah' nonsense :P ).

 
Judaism has clear conditions that need to be met regarding the messiah, and Jesus did not fufil them
 

Judaism is incredibly diverse in interpretation- 'Jews for Judaism' merely uses one (often narrow) theological interpretation and runs for it. For example, that site you gave us does not take into account the fact that traditionally a dual-appearence of the Messiah has been suggested, thus allowing for Jesus to fulfil a glorious, restituting purpose at a future date. Therefore, under this interpretation, Jesus is quite clearly enabled to fulfil a Messianic nature. Ergo, at this point a 'weighing up' of the virtues of either interpretation is necessary.

I can offer plenty of links to this if you like, but a particularly good set of books is by Dr. Michael Brown, entitled "Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus". He is a Jew who believes in Yeshua- he finds his faith's fulfilment in this belief.

 
In fact, Jesus (or his followers) knew the fragility of their claims which is why they fabricated facts such as Jesus being from the Davidic line (he almost certainly wasn't).
 

That is, again, a hefty claim. Care to substantiate?

Furthermore, Jesus achieved His Davidic status from Mary's cousin, who was of Aaronic priestly lineage.

Do you mean you have seen many icons of Mary? Mary is the mother of God, and as such she is venerated because of her position. Icons, statues, paintings etc. of a particular person are helpful to concentrate the minds of those engaged in prayer or indeed, anyone who just wants a focus to help concentrate on anything for that matter.

Mary is not worshipped - worship belongs to God alone.

I think you may that error before and were corrected than. Is it clear to you now?

I see your point, but the fact remains that if you believe Jesus is the messiah then you are not a Jew (ethnically maybe, but religiously certainly). There is no branch of Judaism that would accept that theology. If you believe in Jesus as the messiah then you are a Christian, not a Jew, and you wouldn't be practising Judaism in any form; not matter how Jewish you try and make it (see Jews for Jesus as a prime example).
 
 
Well, then the age-old question remains- what is a Jew?

Is your strand of Judaism any more Jewish than the Hasidics, the Ashkenazi, or even the Ethiopian Jews? Indeed, you all follow different theologies, different approaches to this faith that you call 'Judaism'. Judaism has never been just one belief but instead relied on diversity of interpretation and practice.

Indeed, Messianic Jews (Jews for Jesus- of which, you could probably tell, I am a supporter and a Gentile member) respect the Torah, observe Kosher and other laws, maintain a Messianic hope but (crucially) they see this hope as having been realised in Christ- a Jew, who spoke and taught Judaism (yes, Christianity is Jewish).

They differ in an interpretation of their faith, of course, but you have your own Rabbinic traditions and you follow them- now, to a lesser extreme, what is the difference between you following Ibn Rashi and these Jews following Rabbi Yeshua bar Yosef and His teachings?

The question, as I said above, is- how can you be sure that your (very particular) strand of Judaism cancels out every other, including Christianity? Moreover, if this Rabbi Yeshua is to be judged for truth by anything, it should be by His own claims and (supposed) Resurrection. Have you read His claims, studied His apparant rising from the dead?

There is always the chance that the liberator promised by Ha'shem throughout the days of your forefathers has come, proven Himself and is coming again...

Shalom,

... Now, I may not be a critical genius, but this does not strike me as a logical model nor as commentating on anything at all. For example, premises (2) + (4) are in effect the same, but most worrying is that it merely asserts a position in premise (1) and runs with it- speaking nothing of falsehood or truth.

 

You're right. Looked at again, that's a really stupid argument because it relies on its conclusion ("Jesus is not the Messiah") to even get started. The repetition of (2) is as nothing compared to that!
 
 
I'm probably taking this waaaay out of context, but how about :

1. I claim to be a man
2. A man must have the attributes of a man
3. I don't have all the attributes of a man
4. Therefore, I cannot be a man, and I must be lying.

1. Jesus claims to be the Messiah
2. The Messiah must fufill all the prophecies associated with the Messiah
3. Jesus didn't fufill all the prophecies
4. Therefore, Jesus could not have been the Messiah, and must have been lying.

But i'm not quite sure that was what you were trying to say =/

No, if you believed that you would be a Christian   Judaism is a community religion. You can just say "I am a Jew" and become a Jew. You have to be recognised by a Jewish authority to be Jewish in their eyes. Therefore, Messianic Judaism is not a form of Judaism because it is not recognised by any other strand of Judaism. It may in the future (though I very much hope it doesn't) but at the moment it is an offshoot of Christianity not Judaism; no matter how you dress it up with Hebrew etc.
 
 
So you're a Jew is only Jewish if he or she is recognised as such?

Not meaning to be funny, but where does God, theology or the Tanakh come into this?

This appears to be very much like the experience of the Ethiopian Jews, when they first tried to come into Israel. An 80 year old man is recorded to have said (paraphrased; I can get the quote if you wish):

' For all my life, I have followed the Law, observed the sabbath [etc]. So who has the right to take down my trousers to check if I am circumcised and tell me I am Jewish? '

Indeed, if we rely on a Rabbinic authority to tell one that one is 'Jewish', not only does this exclude a whole host of agents (including God and His own standards), but it also assumes a very particular interpretation of Judaism is correct.

To say someone is a 'Christian' is to comment on their beliefs- it is not a label of identity. To the contrary, to say someone is 'Jewish' is to speak (first and foremost) of their identity. The two terms are not contrary to one another. Therefore the onus is on us to show that the beliefs associated with 'Christian' are in 'cahoots' with Judaism.

I would argue that yes they certainly are- and as such Messianic (belief) Judaism (identity) is just as meaningful as 'Reformed (belief) Jew (identity)'.

Shalom,

Well, if you don't you don't.
But I think that a lot of the muslim view on this issue comes from the Islamic ban on statues/icons/idols of any kind, which isn't there because we ourselves would worship these images but because a couple of years down the line people with less understanding may come to worship them(especially if these images are accorded a great deal of respect).

When it comes to the Jewish identity question it doesn't. Belief in God actually makes up very little of what Judaism is. Being Jewish is about being concerned primarily with ritual rather than belief. Theology doesn't have the same kind of role in Judaism as it does in Christianity or Islam.

It's certainly a risk, and I know of people who regard the vast array of Christian saints to be prayed to for various things as constituting polytheism, but if Mary or the other saints had "stolen" all the worship from God how would we even be having this discussion now? At all points along the line there must have been at least some people who retained an unclouded idea of whom to worship and whom simply to respect. This suggests that the worship of saints and symbols is a perennial trap for the the unwary Christians of each generation, rather than a spreading cancer eating away at Christianity itself.

No, I think that's probably what I was aiming for. The first point of my version ("Jesus is not the Messiah") wasn't necessary at all, as your version shows. And with that point removed, the circular nature of the argument is removed.

So you need the appreiciation of others to be a Jew? To be a Muslim you just need to say, "I'm a muslim" and the GOD will choose from amongst the Muslims, who the real ones are--- for only God has the right to totilitarianism.

Jewish authority? Only God makes the statuses, classes and degrees.

Veneration of saints is a way of integrating the polytheistic beliefs of people within the monotheistic religious framework. You can observe this phenomenon in candomble, macumba and other Western African rituals, but also in some little-developed, traditional regions of Europe, where the cult of various local patron saints is almost on a par with the main divinity-worship, if not more important.

Personally, I see absolutely no problem in that, it sounds like a very democratic and decentralized way of managing a religion.

Yes you do need the appreciation of others. Otherwise everyone would be converting to Judaism   and that just isn't needed because all you need to do is follow the Noachide Code. It has traditionally been said that Jewish law is so complex that converts generally leave Judaism, because they cannot handle it. Thats why Judaism needs protecting; and why the question of who is a Jew is a complicated one.

But what if I thought one day that the Qur'an and Gospel were both wrong and I wanted to become a Jew? It's not very inclusive to say I don't hav enough Jewishness to be a Jew.

I see your point, but I have two objections.

If you meant the spiritual/divine side of religion, then (1) God doesn't need to delegate duties to His saints. This kind of decentralisation could create, in the minds of the less informed, an idea that God needed specialists for various types of prayer - Cecilia for musicians' last-minute prayers before curtain goes up, or Augustine of Hippo if your eyes are sore - which is not at all in line with the idea of omnipotence.

If, on the other hand, you meant the more mundane "managing" done by priests and whatnot, then (2) it doesn't actually have a decentralising effect, because the worship is done in the same place, with the same clergy. You don't get Priests of Joseph the way you got Priests of Apollo.

You could become a Jew, but it would be a long and hard process; and you would be asked why you wanted to become a Jew when you could just follow the Noachide Code stated in the Torah. The process is hard to 'weed' out those who do not have the commitment and discipline to be a Jew.

When I mentioned decentralization I was just -as usual- making fun of revealed religion. But, in fact, this is a serious point.
If you take a holistic Christian approach, such as the one implemented in Western Europe in the late Middle Ages, you will find that all the professional guilds depended from a protector Saint, just as any specific ailment or everyday problem could ideally be solved by a specific Saint.
While it's reasonable to think that god has so many things to look after that you need to have a special protector Saint in order to lobby on your behalf, this is, of course, simply a way of projecting our earthly political system on the heavenly one.
What conclusions can we draw from this? mainly one: when we think of the heavenly order of things, in fact we always have in mind our earthly situation. And, how could it be otherwise?
