      It's safe to say Kevin Kristopik has a bad case of Bieber Fever.

The 15-year-old Bloomfield Village resident was forced to change
his phone number Monday after teen sensation Justin Bieber posted
his number on Twitter over the weekend.

His number was only posted for a few minutes before it was
deleted from Bieber's Twitter page. But word in the
social-networking world -- and especially among Bieber's 4.5
million followers -- spreads fast, and Kevin was besieged with
around 26,000 phone calls and text messages by Monday morning.

Why did Bieber post his number? He allegedly did it to get back
at Kevin, who hacked into one of Bieber's friend's Facebook pages
and got the pop singer's number and began texting him.

Bieber -- who performed Sunday night at The Palace of Auburn
Hills -- allegedly asked Kevin to stop. The singer then Tweeted
Kevin's phone number shortly before midnight Saturday, insinuating
it was his own cell number.

His Tweet -- "Everyone call me 248-[number removed] :) or
text," -- set off such a flood of activity to Kevin's phone that
he posted a video on YouTube of calls and texts pouring in.

After starting Monday doing several interviews, Kevin was
finished talking to the media by mid-morning. By then, the story
had made its way worldwide, including posts on PerezHilton.com. In
addition to changing his phone number, Kevin also deleted his
Twitter account.

"It's certainly been a tremendous amount of activity for him,"
said Kevin's father, Mike Kristopik, on Monday, adding Bieber fans
have even come to the family's front door.

"It's getting overwhelming. He's 15, he's a good-looking kid,
but he's not that social to be thrust into this kind of
limelight."

Spike, co-host of WKQI-FM's (95.5) "Mojo in the Morning," said
he first heard from Kevin a week ago, when the teen e-mailed the
show to brag about hacking into the accounts of Bieber's friend and
even Bieber himself.

"He had a harassing level of annoyance," Spike said Monday. He
said Kevin wanted tickets to Bieber's concert and closed his e-mail
by saying, "Give me tickets or I'll hack you."

Kevin phoned into "Mojo in the Morning" on Monday, and the
staff mocked him and called him "Justin Bieber's stalker." Kevin
said on the show he thought Bieber, 16, took things too far by
sending out his phone number and said he's no longer a fan of the
singer.

For his part, Kevin could face legal ramifications for his
online travails.

Jeremy Bisdorf, who practices information and technology law in
Southfield and Ann Arbor, said penalties for hackers can be steep.

"If he gained unauthorized access into an electronic system,
not only do you have civil but there's potential criminal
liability," he said.

There's no word if Bieber or anyone in his camp will press
charges against Kevin; requests for comment from Bieber's camp went
unanswered Monday.

Facebook has policies in place to protect against hackers.
"Facebook is committed to protecting your information," reads the
site's privacy information. "We have industry standard and
proprietary network monitoring tools constantly running in our
system in order to prevent security breaches and protect the
security of your data."

Kristopik condemned his son's actions, saying he believes he
deserved what he got but hopes there are no long-term consequences.

"It's an embarrassment in one way, and it shows you if you're
publishing something anyone can see it," he said. "People are
asking if Kevin learned anything from it, and I don't know if he
did or not."

What Kristopik is most worried about is charges from
international texts racking up a sizable phone bill.

"If I have a $20,000 bill, I'm going to be pretty upset," he
said.
