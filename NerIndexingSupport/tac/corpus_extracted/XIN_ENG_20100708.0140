Kenya on Thursday called on African countries to embrace peace and avoid civil
strife, saying the latter has contributed to the destruction of physical
infrastructure, loss of institutional capacity, social and human capital in the
continent.

Vice-President Kalonzo Musyoka said apart from independence wars, nearly 20
African countries have experienced at least one period of civil strife since
1960 which has led to huge direct and incalculable indirect costs to the
affected countries.

"Once started, civil wars retard economic and social development and aggravate
poverty thus completing the vicious circle of conflict, poverty and exclusionary
politics," he said during the official opening of a course for senior government
and military officers in Nairobi.

The 47 week course brings together participants from Kenya Armed Forces,
Ministries and other Senior Military officers from African countries.

The Vice President noted that such civil wars could leave a social and negative
political legacy that affects development for decades, adding that such
conflicts have reinforced perceptions of Africa as a doomed continent with
inescapable ethnic cleavages and tribalism.

He said real security in a globalizing world can only be provided through a
multilateral and global approach and not on purely national basis.

Musyoka noted that security challenges cannot be resolved by resorting to
traditional security tools such as raising military expenditures, dispatch of
troops, sealing and closing of borders.

He said there was need to look deeper into alternative security arrangements if
Africa is to gain in the 21st century and urged for promoting of new peacemaking
such as establishing border committees to fix transboundary conflicts and
strengthening East Africa Standby Brigade.

The government will support strategic research and learning institutions in
order to boost market policy and industrial development.

Musyoka lauded the military for setting up the National Defence College (NDC)
which has become a premier institution for training current, future technocrats
and policy makers in the region.

He said such institutions will help propel regional integration and economic
growth. Musyoka called on governments to come up with political models that
facilitate consensus and inclusion of marginalized groups.

The Vice President noted that countries like Kenya and Uganda have increased
export by diversifying into non traditional exports of vegetables, fruits and
flowers.

He said Africa needs policy reforms to remove constraints such as road, port,
railway infrastructure and lower transaction costs in order to encourage trade
between the states.

The Vice President called on States to stop heavy dependency on primary
commodities as a source of export earnings but to instead invest in value
addition of their commodities before export.
