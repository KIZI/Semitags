"Ann Coulter is a big asshole!"

Mann Coulter has convinced Palm Beach officials to removed her home
address from county property records.

Seems like the political pundit has been had one too many people come
and harass her at home.

She had one lovely greeting card dropped off, which read, "The only
things left after a nuclear war are you and cockroaches" and had "Go
fuck yourself" printed on its face.

Another visitor wasn't as polite and started shouting "Ann Coulter is
a big asshole" from outside her house.

Since the writers are striking, they should come up with more clever
things to say outside Mann's home!

P.S. Coulter turns 46 in two weeks.

Happy birthday! You're almost 50!

Don't let him get to you.  Coulter is just doing an act to make money
off of the ignorant masses.  Like what Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly
do.  It's all schtick.  There is a huge demand in the U.S. for
"pundits" who say the things that the ignorant and angry want to
hear.  It makes them feel like they have a voice or that their scary
opinions are "valid".

I wouldn't be surprised if pundits from both sides "of the aisle" have
security concerns. Musicians and hollywood folks have to, also sports
people....
