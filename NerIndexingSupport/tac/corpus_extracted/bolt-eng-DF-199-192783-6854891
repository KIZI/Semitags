So, you feel that the countries in question did not pursue relatively evil policies prior to Bush's statement, right?

You may prefer leaders who are too tactful to identify great evil on the world stage, but some of us do not.

No, I feel that the countries in question could have been encouraged to develop more enlightened policies through inclusion in the world community and diplomacy rather than through rhetorical posturing and saber rattling. The failure of the latter course is self-evident.

Too soon to say. Currently, I think it brought out in the open, exactly what was going on the those nations and has created serious debate in the US as well as in the UN.
 
 
Was the Axis of Evil portion of the President's speech necessary?

No, it wasn't necessary... but it was useful.

All three of the countries listed were brutal dictatorships long known for oppressing their own people, and threatening their regional neighbors. None of the three had shown the least bit of willingness to engage in honest negotiations or diplomacy. Both the DPRK and Iran were already working feverishly toward building their own nuclear warheads, and Iraq was coyly insinuating that they possessed, or would soon have, weapons of mass terror. Iraq and Iran had long supported terrorism, while the DPRK has continually conducted special operations against ROK since the 1950's. Iraq and Iran encouraged attacks on Israel and applauded terrorist attacks on the U.S. As pointed out above, identifying these three countries as an "Axis of Evil" was well supported by the facts.

Declaring the three an "Axis of Evil" in an important national speech clearly signaled a change from the soft-soap diplomacy of past administrations (both Republican and Democrat), that had failed for over 50 years in the case of the DPRK, and decades in the Iranian and Iraq cases. This was similar to JFK's famous inauguration pledge to promote democracy around the world. Of course, it also was reminiscent of the Democratic sloganeering during WWII. The President was calling for Congressional and public support for a long and expensive struggle against enemies determined to wage unconstrained war against the West. All in all it was, in my opinion, a clear and necessary focus intended to guide Congress and the Nation in the days ahead.

Was it diplomatically useful, or harmful?

It was diplomatically useful, in the same way it was useful domestically as described above.

It wasn't harmful, because none of the three named rogue States had ever shown themselves willing to engage in honest diplomacy. All were openly and directly dangerous to their regional neighbors. The DPRK and Iran were rushing to build nuclear warheads. There was no reason then, nor now to believe that any of the three would become less threatening in the future. Identifying them was in itself a strong diplomatic effort to caution them that in the future the U.S. would take a much stronger position when threatened. They were warned. Saddam ignored his ultimatum believing his friends and partners in France and Russia would prevent the U.S. from taking him down. The DPRK and Iran presumably got that message, but have been emboldened by the difficulties we've faced in Iraq, and the success they've had in mobilizing pacifists in our own camp.

Look Brandon, Ash knows how to answer a question.
I know it's a lot to ask, but why don't you learn from his example.
 
 
Official statements about other gov'ts are always the truth and never diplomatic strategies? Oh, please!

I have no idea what Bush intended with that speech--probably just the chest-thumping he was doing back then--but he sure has been more careful in talking about No. Korea and Iran now!

This kind of childish personal jibe with no value, and no relation to the topic is the quintessence of what's wrong with A2K. I can only hope that one day we'll have mostly members who behave like adults.

Considering your historical eagerness to "win" debates you seem to suffer from a deficiency in common sense.
A question was posed in the introductory post.
It is up to the participants of that thread to resond to the question, not to make demands of the poster to respond to their questions.
I highly doubt that a debate would function as it should if you avoided the topic and instead demanded that the organizers respond to your questions.
Seems silly to me, but I'm sure you have a perfectly logical explanation for why you're right.

My jibe was not personal, it was similar in kind to many comments that have in the past been made in your direction. The nature of it was related directly to the discussion throughout the thread, namely, to respond to the question.
I merely pointed out Asherman's articulate post and suggested that you could combat the criticisms of your MO by following his example.

In the future I will be mindful of your fragile ego and rethink my responses to you so as to not cause any undue harm.
 
 
W has given Iran the upper hand by eliminating Saddam's control of Iraq.

Okay, thanks, you imbecile. And moving right along, I believe that president Bush was accurate when he described the governments of North Korea, Iran and Iraq as evil. Furthermore, I believe that it is ultimately never helpful to ignore great evil abroad in the world or to pretend it isn't there. I'm sure that had you or au1929 lived, say, in the time when Nazi Germany started persecuting Jews and putting them in concentration camps, you would have counseled that someone representing you take the tactful approach, rather than state plainly that great evil was being done, but personally I think that would be both cowardly and counterproductive.

I am still waiting for you to stop posturing and for once give a direct, intelligent response to a question asked. Is that too much to ask or for you to comprehend?
Have you ever wondered why almost every thread you are involved in ends the same way.

I gave a direct answer, which you still have not. I know you're a liberal, but can you just for once try to discuss the topic and not the posters?

You asked:

To which I responded:

 
...Furthermore, I believe that it is ultimately never helpful to ignore great evil abroad in the world or to pretend it isn't there.
 

You still haven't answered the question in my initial post in this thread, which consisted of the single sentence, "Is it true?"

"...stop posturing and for once give a direct, intelligent response to a question asked."
 
 
the phrase is effectively meaningless.

what would 'the center of wisdom' mean? or 'the nexus of sad things'? or 'the foundation of goodness'?

It is, and this is its purpose, a slogan.

any effectiveness this slogan had looks limited to the construction of consensus within a certain segment of the domestic citizenry, such as brandon.

the negative consequences of the administration's use of the phrase are more broad and far more significant. ask folks from countries outside of america how such simplistic slogans land on their ears and you'll have a start to some understanding of why the rest of the world considers this government both dangerous and not terribly bright.

more significant is the predictable consequence that Iran and Korea would perceive a likely or potential military (and other) threat from america and validate or speed up their nuke programs as deterent.
 
 
Blatham, do you consider the 3 nations named to be other then evil? If so, what would you consider them?

Is Myanmar evil? Is china evil? Is rupert murdock or google in some sense or to some degree evil for doing business with them? Is america in some sense evil for helping Hussein build his military and his hold on power? Was germany evil? All of germany?

The term isn't analytically useful in descriptions of groups, if useful at all. It functions as a way of saying "I/we don't like" something or someone but doing so in a way that ends reflection or more complex analyses. You may as well ask, is James Baker supporting evil when he offers a "realist" portrayal of american foreign polcies/options. How is it that Hussein suddenly became evil when he was not earlier?

It's a useful category and it doesn't end more complex analysis. The idea that no one is evil, or that no country pursues generally evil policies, or that no country treats its own citizens in a generally evil way, or that no boy is bad is naive. Saddam Hussein was obviouly evil throughout his entire adult life, not suddenly. If some country like Canada seeks the bomb, sure it's nothing to be happy about, but we know that they generally pursue sane, and reasonably moral policies. If someone like Idi Amin Dada or Pol Pot were to have shown signs of developing nuclear or bio weapons, it would have been a cause for concern, since their history of evil behavior suggests that they couldn't be trusted with the weapons, and might do terrible harm with them. If it's such a useless category why do so many America-haters on this board refer to US policy as evil (or synonym)?

and the way you deal with evil is to....smile and shake hands with it? (rummy, remember), sell it armaments? give it intelligence data? allow it to purchase from america the chemical constituents used against the Kurds and then withhold criticism when he uses it on them?

"Axis of evil" has the same truth value as "blondes have more fun" or "don't squeeze the Charmin".

You've been sold a product. Perhaps you think that is exaggerated. Andrew Card, on when the war might start... "From a marketing standpoint, you don't roll out a new product in August."

probably didn't change much with l'il kim. he's kinda insecure and beligerant. it did, however, provide him with an excuse to get all huffy, no matter how thin his rationale is.. even if he's the only one buying it.

from what iranian folks here tell me, the axis remark put a pretty good ding in whatever movement was being made away from theocratic rule in iran. that may have happened anyway due to other factors, but making threatening comments doesn't seem to have helped the internal pro-democracy movement there.

all in all, the axis of evil declaration seems to have been helpful to dubya (for a while), but it hasn't solved any problems for the rest of us.

I also think that the government of the People's Republic of China is evil, but that doesn't mean that I favor cutting off all relations with them. The world is more comlicated than that. Just because we make a deal with someone doesn't imply that we like them. Sometimes they're the enemies of our enemies. Are you actually going to entertain us with a denial that Saddam Hussein was evil? For a national leader to never comment on great evil occurring in the world, especially when such evil looks like it may eventually manifest itself in a very dangerous way, and that some prep work needs to be done soon, would be irresponsible. Inability to psychically predict the outcome of every action of ours is not a fault.

If you read my post, you ought to know that I was talking about our relationship with Saddam Hussein in the 80s. Try reading posts before you reply to them.

I do not regard the invasion of Iraq as a mistake at all. At the moment of invasion, based on the totality of our information about Iraq, there was a non-trivial chance that Hussein was continuing to develop WMD in hiding. Only an absolute fool would have put his head in the sand and ignored this moderate chance of an absolute calamity. Diplomacy having failed, Bush was right to invade. Your idea that every war which is difficult is a mess is naive.

Blatham, you have not answered my question.
 

Do you still beat your grandmother? Who is more incompetent, Reagan or Dubya? Is France evil? Are republicans evil? Are democrats evil? Is Halloween evil?

Your question wasn't an attempt to get aid or provoke understanding. It was an attempt, though not intentional, of avoiding complexity.

What on earth can the term "evil" mean? Does it refer, as General Boykin holds, to the footprints of Beezelebub?

 
"The battle this nation is in is a spiritual battle, it's a battle for our soul. And the enemy is a guy called Satan...Satan wants to destroy this nation. He wants to destroy us as a nation and he wants to destroy us as a Christian army."
 

Does it refer to some circumstance (a baby burning in a fire or your cousin being eaten by a grizzley or your neighbors being blown apart in a bombing raid)? Does it refer to some intention held by a self-aware person? Can it be applied to any past British or Dutch or American policy? Any present American policy? Any present American leader? Was Love Canal an "evil"? Are tobacco execs "evil"? Can you imagine yourself in the shoes of a Lebanese computer technician who's wife and children were heat-melted by phosphorous weapons two months ago and now has unchangeable notions about "evil" and who is properly described by the term?

You tell me what "evil" means.

That's a lot of unneccessary flair Blatham. Makes me wonder if you didn't read the question or maybe you didn't understand it. It really wasn't that difficult and certainly didn't intend to invoke your tired wrath.

Read the question again Blatham, I will highlight the part I actually expected you to answer.

 
Blatham, do you consider the 3 nations named to be other then evil? If so, what would you consider them?
 
 
 
Obviously, the first question isn't answerable until you draw out some careful and consistent definition of what that term might even mean.

To your second question, I could share that all three fall away from my notions of how governance ought to be done.
 
 
 
I also think that the government of the People's Republic of China is evil, but that doesn't mean that I favor cutting off all relations with them. The world is more comlicated than that.

A valuable point is made here by Blatham McG, and that is the philosophical notion of what is or is not evil, and whether or not the term can fairly or adequately be applied to a nation, a government, a people or a person.
Do no other, possibly more fitting, descriptors exist?
Labelling Il's North Korea, or Ahmadinejad's Iran as "evil" is wholly analogous to the calls from al-Qaeda and other militants in the region to destroy the Great Satan, and they are useless labels to attach.

Sorry, was that in reference to me or to Brandon?
If it was to me, then surely the question could be posed also to your friend.

The point I was making, first of all, was to Brandon, secondly, was intended to demonstrate that if one wishes to make habits of correcting others' spelling, then one better go over theirs with a fine toothed comb, and third, spelling mistakes are rarely germane to the discussion.
So, McG, take out your teeth and bite me.

I think this thread is perfect as it is, and should be preserved.

It becomes apparent that the problem is that liberals don't believe in the existence of evil, or, at least, scoff at the word when used, indicating they don't recognize it as a valid concept.

That really says it all, and in particular shows why they ought not to be in the position of running the country.
 
 
Absolutely Brandon. The true measure of an administration is in their ability or willingness to apply to things, people and nations, the term "evil".

A pity that you can only defeat an opponent's idea by knowingly misstating it.

I certainly did not assert what you dishonestly ascribe to me. What I said was that "evil" is a useful category. I also said that an unwillingness to recognize the existence of evil in the world, or to recognize it as important and relevant, makes one unfit to lead a country.

If you're going to argue against my point of view, how about arguing against my actual point of view, and not putting words in my mouth that I never said?

Alright, I agree with you, although not about Bush. And, if, as you now admit, evil exists, it is important for a national leader to point it out and lay plans against it, in cases where it looks like it might manifest itself in a dangerous way.

Perhaps there is a sense from the perspective of Ahmadinejad that Israel is evil. He then has the same right to point it out, and lay plans against it if it in some way manifests itself as a potential danger.
Yes?

The hypocrisy in the acceptable use of the term "evil" against Ahmadinejad, Hussein or Jong-Il and the unacceptable use of it against Bush/the conservative aganda in the ME speaks volumes for your inability to fairly apply the term.

From the perspective of those in the ME and the DPRK, the US under Bush has become increasingly threatening to their self-interests and increasingly dangerous.
 
 
 
Diplomacy having failed, Bush was right to invade.
 

That's kind of the essence of it, isn't it? Of course, in Brandon's black-and-white world there's only either diplomacy, or war.

Nonwithstanding the fact that the sanctions and the weapons inspectors on the ground in Iraq where decidedly more than diplomacy, and decidedly less than outright war.

And successful at keeping Saddam from acquiring WMD, I might add.

Fairly apply the term? Is that the problem for you? I have no doubt you support the evil regimes of the world and feel the need to defend them Perhaps your morals have decided their actions don't approach such a concept as "evil" yet the US and Israel do... I would say your morals are **** if that is the case and you might want to seek professional help to straighten them out. Do you feel that way?
 
 
 
Fairly apply the term? Is that the problem for you? I have no doubt you support the evil regimes of the world and feel the need to defend them Perhaps your morals have decided their actions don't approach such a concept as "evil" yet the US and Israel do... I would say your morals are **** if that is the case and you might want to seek professional help to straighten them out. Do you feel that way?
 

You judge me on nothing more than partisan prejudice.

I have stated that there be a more fair application of the term evil and that there be some degree of relativity applied in the usage of the term.

Do you not think that Iran, N. Korea and Iraq would view the US as an evil empire? Is it that my morals are f***ed or is it perhaps more likely that you subscribe to a morality that holds others to standards that you are not willing to uphold.

While I do view the US and Israel as different kinds of evil nations than say, Saddam's Iraq or Il's Korea, it is worthy to engage in a discussion about the kinds of evil that are perpetrated by Israel and the US.
 
 
 
 
Diplomacy having failed, Bush was right to invade.
 

That's kind of the essence of it, isn't it? Of course, in Brandon's black-and-white world there's only either diplomacy, or war.

Nonwithstanding the fact that the sanctions and the weapons inspectors on the ground in Iraq where decidedly more than diplomacy, and decidedly less than outright war.

And successful at keeping Saddam from acquiring WMD, I might add.
 
[/b]

i agree. but a restrained and monitored saddam were politically useless to the right wing and an annoyance to the neocons at the project.

it would seem that further inspections would confirm that, as was claimed post gulf I, that nearly all of iraq's wmd had been destroyed by coalition and iaea teams. don't remember the exact percentage quoted, but i seem to remember that the number was something like 95 or 98% of his existing weapons. i am sure it was more than 90%. the numbers are out there for any wishing to do the research...

i do remember that during the inspections saddam had attained a rocket that had a range of 120 miles, which exceeded the imposed limit of 90 miles. 30 miles... those rockets were summarily destroyed by the iaea and un inspectors.

a rocket of 120 miles may have been a threat to the u.s. if our country bordered iraq on any one of it's boundries. however......

nope, it still comes off to me that bush and his handlers were set on iraq as the entered the white house.
 
 
I am sure that the evil in the world no doubt see the freedom's that the US supports as a form of evil and am not the least bit surprised to see someone on A2K try to see their point of view. Any threat to their wicked dominance in their own countries must be scorned by them and those that support them, but I don't see the same kind of evils being perpetrated by the governments of the US or Israel.
 
 
 
I am sure that the evil in the world no doubt see the freedom's that the US supports as a form of evil.....
 

This is the tripe that has continually been peddled by the American right....that "they hate us for our freedoms". Limiting the argument to a one dimensional discussion is self-serving but only breeds further ignorance.
Be honest with yourself McG....is it really the freedom that they hate, or is it something else.
 
 
 
I am not the least bit surprised to see someone on A2K try to see their point of view.
 

I guess I still fee that there is something to be gained by understanding the perspectives of others rather than creating my own rationale for their behavior.
Again, is it the freedoms of the US that they hate, or is it something else?

maybe they hate us because for 6 years people run around saying "freedoms" when "freedom" will suffice.

in other words, you either have freedom or you don't.  

sorry... that phrase has been buggin' the hell out me for years.....
 
 
I guess you're right....freedom is not a partial offering. Freedom entails a multitude of "freedom s ".
Any restrictions on one freedom negates the wholesale concept of freedom in the broader sense.

I guess even in Canada and the US, we are not free....

I believe that evil exists in people. Take Bush for instance.  
 

Alright, I agree with you, although not about Bush. And, if, as you now admit, evil exists, it is important for a national leader to point it out and lay plans against it, in cases where it looks like it might manifest itself in a dangerous way.
 

Whether evil exists or does not. Bush's axis of evil statement was as meaningless as the blowhard that made it. Further, it bought us nothing in the war on terror and in fact hardened our adversaries position.
 

So, basically you're saying that a national leader should politely refrain from discussing great evil in the world, even in cases where it may manifest itself dangerously in the future, so as to avoid hurting anyone's feelings. That sounds like a pretty skewed and typically liberal view of the world.
 
 
 
 
It becomes apparent that the problem is that liberals don't believe in the existence of evil.....and in particular shows why they ought not to be in the position of running the country.
 

I have misstated nothing, unless your intended message differed from what you in fact said.

Seems to me that you advocate the notion that the belief in, or application of, the term "evil" is germane to one's ability to run the country.
 

Germane, sure. I said that, of course, but you said:

 
Absolutely Brandon. The true measure of an administration is in their ability or willingness to apply to things, people and nations, the term "evil".
 

I never said that, nor do I believe it. I only said that admitting that evil exists and is relevant is one requirement for a world leader, nothing like what you have quoted me as asserting, so how is that not a misstatement of my opinion? This is akin to me saying that a world leader shouldn't be a bank robber, and you the quoting me as saying that the true measure of a leader is his repudiation of bank robbing. You've lied twice. First you misquoted me, so as to have an easier proposition to argue against, and then you claimed you hadn't.
 
 
The Texan weilding the brand seared said nations in an attempt to make word associations with the Axis powers of WWII.
It was a clear move away from anything that even resembled diplomacy in an attempt to ignite his base in the post 9/11 fervor.

I become rather uncomfortable when Bush takes up the name calling or the descriptions of just what this trio has in mind for Americans.

Bush has made a judgment call, saying the leaders of these countries are "evil." Judgment calls are seldom ever a good idea. Definitely not how winners, win.

You are sorely splitting hairs and arguing, quite incorrectly, that I have siad two different things here Brandon.
What is clear is that you believe that the use and application of the term "evil" is a credential that is a necessary one if an individual hopes to run the country.
I think that the term can be used and can be used appropriately, but it is neither germane nor an essential club to carry onto the first teebox. It surely has no place in the president's vernacular, nor does it have a place in discussing foreign relations.

I think the public branding of the alleged "axis of evil" was simply another inflaming chest pounding exercise on how not to acheive diplomatic objectives.

brandon

I have a couple of questions so that I can clarify what you are talking about.

Where does 'evil' come from?
Where does it reside?
What range of things might this word apply to? For example, a mean dog? A product (say, some sort of weapon)?
 
 
 
Brandon is Bush evil or just stupid? What is your opinion.
 

I find it counterproductive to keep changing the subject in the middle of a discussion, although I understand the reasons why you do it. Evil exists, the term is a useful category, and all that is required for evil to triumph is for good men to say nothing.

Not what I said. Again, you find it useful to misrepresent your opponent's viewpoint in order to obtain something you can compete with. I was talking to someone who had condemned identifying evil on the grounds that the evil might be angered by it. Are you constitutionally incapable of arguing against what your opponent actually said?

I have to go get a couple of dinners out of a microwave and have to be brief, but it would be approximately correct to say that the word evil describes someone who considers his own welfare to greatly outway the welfare of others.
 
 
No, I am interpreting your statement not bringing it to a level I feel that I can "compete" with it.
Recap:

 
The point is there was nothing to gain from the Axis of evil srtatement. And in fact it was a diplomatic blunder that could only inflame and harden the positions of those nations.
 

To which you respond:

 
So, you favor appeasing evil, not offending it? So, in school, when some bully demanded your lunch money, your primary emphasis was to try not to offend him lest he get really mad?
 

If a wife is beaten by her husband, should she further inflame him by calling him trailer trash?
If a fight has broken out in the hallway of a college between a black and a white male, should one antagonize the situation further by calling the opponent a cracker-ass-cracker or a n*gger?
When faced with an adversary in diametrical opposition to oneself, should one endeavor to fuel the fire, and play on the same court, by the same rules of those with whom we have antithetical beliefs, or should they take a position that is more advantageous and not mutually destructive?

This tired old conservative tough guy rhetoric solves nothing, as Bush's Axis of Evil statement proved.

You assert that if one does not apply the term evil to one's adversaries, one is therefore appeasing them.
I am not surprised by your black and white perspective on complex human issues Brandon.

Ever thought that the application of the term "evil" to said adversaries was unnecessary, or that there were perhaps other means or mechanisms for identifying their threat?

An evil person..."Someone who considers his own welfare to greatly outweigh the welfare of others"

Selfishness on steroids? How would "acting in our nation's best interests" fit into such a definition?

And what about someone who considers his own childrens' welfare to greatly outweight the welfare of other people's children? Equally 'evil'?

You skipped the questions I put to you. If you had tried to answer them, or think about them very much, you'd probably be less willing to toss the word "evil" around as unreflectively as you are doing.

Some people, like General Boykin who I quoted earlier, consider that "evil" is a property of things/people which exists because of Satan. I know McG doesn't think that way, and I'm not sure about you. Your answer above suggests you don't. That's good as it allows at least some sort of conversation that isn't just plain looney.

But even if you and McG don't hold that Satan stuffed "evil" into people and things, you still talk (and think, apparently) that "evil" is a property of persons/things. A country can be evil, you suggest. But it is as senseless and unhelpful to think this way as it is to think that a country can be "sad" or "beautiful" or even "good". Is the Dutch West Indies "good"?

"Canada is beautiful". That's a hugely stupid sentence, if we wish to be careful. Dying old people in a hospice in Toronto...beautiful? The Prime Minister getting a colonoscopy...beautiful? A thousand tons of H2O seeking equilibrium (a waterfall)...beautiful? Beauty isn't a property of a thing. It is a response or a judgement in some viewer.

It doesn't make much real world difference if we say, rather poetically, that "Panama is a sad country". It doesn't make much difference because that judgement about Panama doesn't suggest that the place ought to be fumigated or bombed or have its government taken out back and shot. That's what makes "evil" a particularly dangerous term.

And it is why we have to be VERY clear that "evil" isn't a property of a thing, it is a word we use to communicate the strength of our negative response to something we witness or hear about. "Evil" is in a language of emotional response, not rational thought.

I am glad you have finally, sort of, defined evil for our consideration...

I would like to start by answering your questions briefly.

Where does 'evil' come from? The actions of man (not exclusive, but descriptive of the human race)
Where does it reside? In the hearts of man
What range of things might this word apply to? For example, a mean dog? A product (say, some sort of weapon)? Only man is evil. I believe evil is a result of intelligence and there are no "evil" things in the natural world.

Evil is not Satan, a by-product od satan, and should not be reduced to some super-natural force. As Forrest Gump would say, "Evil is as evil does."

When I say a country, I mean it's government and the actions it takes as they relate to my personal values and morals. For example, raping someone is an evil act. Killing someone other than in self-defense or as punishment for a crime (which would have been an evil act) is an act of evil.

The governments of Iran, Iraq and North Korea are all guilty of many evil acts. Killing innocents, keeping half their population as a subserviant second-class, starving their citizens, supporting terrorism, arming terrorists, etc... These are acts of evil and therefore "evil is as evil does".
 
 
 
I am glad you have finally, sort of, defined evil for our consideration...
 

When dealing with a term such as this one, the first step is trying to make manifest all the things about we we might assume without even being aware we are making such assumptions.

 
Where does it reside? In the hearts of man
 

There's an example, though a much less important one. It ain't sitting below the left ventricle, as you know.

 
The governments of Iran, Iraq and North Korea are all guilty of many evil acts. Killing innocents, keeping half their population as a subserviant second-class, starving their citizens, supporting terrorism, arming terrorists, etc... These are acts of evil and therefore "evil is as evil does".
 

But the US too has committed acts of "evil". Read Twain on the Phillipines. Or the folks who were unlucky enough to live near to Noriega's house. Lots of etceteras.

So its not sufficient to simply note acts committed (or ommitted). Probably, we have to figure out some sort of measure which weighs cumulative consequences of an individual's acts, or a group's acts.

I think you've got it square on to focus on 'acts'. Obviously, 'intentions' too must be part of what we consider (above, Brandon makes no mention of cruelty, the intentional causing of pain/suffering). I consider that the present administration's attempts to excuse or legalize or legitimize torture are a moral wrong. You might argue that, but certainly no one would argue that such acts done for pleasure constitute a clear moral wrong.

One of the fundamental dangers of using this sort of language of 'evil' is that we are remarkably blind to consequences of our own acts and to assumptions about ourselves. It is easy to imagine a fundamentalist Muslim of the "America is Satan" sort considering that merely as a function of his adherence to the Koran (his understanding of it, of course) gives him a goodness or godliness right from the git go. He can't be wrong, or can't be very wrong, because he swims in an ocean of The Good. Unfortunately, such is also the case with nutty christians and nutty americans or nutty Brits, etc.

The more one looks at this slogan 'axis of evil', the more ludicrous it becomes as any sort of helpful way to think about things and, certainly, for a political figure to use in talking about the world.

For me, military or diplomatic or aid intervention seems morally justified (even morally necessary) where some population of civilians are suffering through accident or through cruelty/oppression, etc. And that is the moral argument which we all responded to as regards Iraq and which we respond to when we think or say that North Korea is really an ugly situation for far too many people.

But...but...but... if we face reality, then we are forced to acknowledge that there is simply no chance at all that if Iraq was located somewhere in the arctic and had no oil reserves, we wouldn't have gone there. That if Israel had established itself in northern Canada and the esquimos wanted it gone, the US and the Israeli government would be far, far more disconnected than at present. Israel is important not merely out of sympathy, or out of significant jewish populations here, or out of intensive lobbying, or out of cultural/historical sympathies, but mainly because of where it is and its importance to the oil resource.
 
 
Intentions certainly weigh heavily on evil. Interrogating terrorists in an effort to save innocent lives could hardly be considered an act of evil. Torturing a man because he is of a different religion would be an act of evil.

Take a look at the "axis of evil" statement in it's context:

 
Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th. But we know their true nature. North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.

Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.

Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens -- leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections -- then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.

States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.
 

It's very fitting.

If Iraq were in a region that had no oil, they would not be in the position they are in because they would not have had access to the massive funds their natural resource has provided them. They would be a backwater country embroiled in internal religious affairs and would be of no concern on the world stage. That arguement holds no water Blatham. It's the oil that has provided Saddam the funding to be a danger.

Has the US committed acts of evil in that past? Sure. Is that what really concerns you about Bush's statement though? We must be more concerned about the future though, while being mindful of the past.

I am sure you know that "In the hearts of man" is a metaphor. You belittle your own intelligence commenting on it as anything other then that.

Re "heart"...you'll note the tag end of my sentence..."as you know". And I said it wasn't a terribly important use of questionable language. I meant merely to point again to the ways in which language, metaphors in particular, can play tricks on us, in no small part because we tend to stop thinking when we put them to use.

That oil allowed Iraq to become affluent is true, but it is irrelevant. If it were the case that it reached its 2000 AD level of affluence but had merely another year's worth of oil underground, and if there was no other oil in that region, the US would not have invaded. Control and domination of the resource (essential to the US and modern economies) and NOT moral considerations is the only sensible conclusion as to motivation. There are parts of the world where many more have and are dying preventable deaths but they gain little attention from the US government whereas the investment in this Iraq project is mind-boggling in terms of dollars. The war was marketed as a self-defence project and then marketed as a moral project. The important word there is 'marketed'. North Korea did not see a landing of US forces and they now have the bomb whereas Iraq did not and would not have had it these many years later.

The PNAC states, explicitly, that what America ought to get up to in this uni-polar world is the maintenance/increase of its own dominance in the world through taking on anyone who might pose a threat to that dominance. Such a project would definitely NOT gain the support of the majority of US citizens, not to mention allies in the world. And that's why you've experienced this onslaught of marketing re Sadaam and evil.
 
 
 
There are parts of the world where many more have and are dying preventable deaths but they gain little attention from the US government
 

They don't seem to be getting much attention from any government. That's a nice device you have there Blatham. What is Canada doing about those places? The EU? You can blame America for many things, but you are off base on this one. Those places do not present the destructive power of an Iraq, made wealthy and influential because of it's natural resources.

Why allow a country like Iraq access to such a powerful weapon as the atom bomb? Lil'Kim has already shown the power that mere rumors of owning a nuclear device can basically blackmail the world, as you have stated.

If Iraq did not have oil, they would not have the ability to threaten the world or it's neighbors and we would not have needed to invade them. We can dance in this circle all day if you would like, but oil is not the reason we invaded and no hypothetical will make that the case.

Bush listed off a number of reason for describing them as evil. Can you refute any of them?
 
 
 
No, I am interpreting your statement not bringing it to a level I feel that I can "compete" with it.
Recap:

 
The point is there was nothing to gain from the Axis of evil srtatement. And in fact it was a diplomatic blunder that could only inflame and harden the positions of those nations.
 

To which you respond:

 
So, you favor appeasing evil, not offending it? So, in school, when some bully demanded your lunch money, your primary emphasis was to try not to offend him lest he get really mad?
 

 

Yes, which you then characterize as:

 
I guess if you do not make frequent use and/or application of the term "evil", you are appeasing those who are.

Sound logic Brandon.
 

I didn't say that if one doesn't make "frequent use and/or application of the term "evil", you are appeasing those who are" evil. I said that if one refrains from doing so in order not to anger the evil entity in question, then you are appeasing him/it. I didn't say that you have to use the term evil at least 5 times a day. So once again you respond to a statement that I never made, rather than what I actually said.

 
If a wife is beaten by her husband, should she further inflame him by calling him trailer trash?
If a fight has broken out in the hallway of a college between a black and a white male, should one antagonize the situation further by calling the opponent a cracker-ass-cracker or a n*gger?
When faced with an adversary in diametrical opposition to oneself, should one endeavor to fuel the fire, and play on the same court, by the same rules of those with whom we have antithetical beliefs, or should they take a position that is more advantageous and not mutually destructive?

This tired old conservative tough guy rhetoric solves nothing, as Bush's Axis of Evil statement proved.

You assert that if one does not apply the term evil to one's adversaries, one is therefore appeasing them.
I am not surprised by your black and white perspective on complex human issues Brandon.

Ever thought that the application of the term "evil" to said adversaries was unnecessary, or that there were perhaps other means or mechanisms for identifying their threat?
 

You appear to be implying that it is never appropriate to publicly identify evil in the world. I should think it obvious that sometimes it is helpful and sometimes it isn't. I do think it is sometimes helpful for a national leader to identify nations which are doing great evil in the world, especially when such countries may soon manifest their evil in very harmul ways. Identifying a problem is the first step towards fixing it. Now, if you respond, I think it would save time if you don't put words in my mouth which I never said. It's not very hard for me to say, "Candidone1, you're a fool for advocating the unliateral disarmament of the West," but if you never said any such thing, it's not very honest of me, is it?

I don't think we are going to get anywhere.
 
 
By way of example, take this information here...

 
America is now seen as a threat to world peace by its closest neighbours and allies, according to an international survey of public opinion published today that reveals just how far the country's reputation has fallen among former supporters since the invasion of Iraq.

Carried out as US voters prepare to go to the polls next week in an election dominated by the war, the research also shows that British voters see George Bush as a greater danger to world peace than either the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, or the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Both countries were once cited by the US president as part of an "axis of evil", but it is Mr Bush who now alarms voters in countries with traditionally strong links to the US.
 

Bush said, and may even have believed, that Iran, NK, and Iraq posed great threat as a function of their "evil" quotient and their potential to influence the world negatively.

Given these polling results above, what must be the notions held - by even the Brits, Canadians and Israelis, for gods sakes - concerning present America?

Likely, these folks wouldn't insist that Bush or America is "evil". But that seems mainly because such a simplistic and metaphoric framework is understood to be, of itself, deeply dangerous.

That's because you want to speak about hypotheticals and secret organizations planning to take over the world. It's almost like I am having a discussion with bluflame.

I asked a question in my last post regarding Bush's statement. Can you refute any of the points Bush made in his description of the 3 countries he has described as the "axis of evil"?

The PNAC is not a secret organization, it is well-documented and has clearly outlined objectives. The fact that you can't be bothered to research the motivations of your party leaders doesn't make them any less relevant to the discussion.

In the context Blatham was using, it sounds suspiciously like the illuminati instead of a political organization with an agenda.

A plan does not a government make Cycloptichorn and as long as we have free elections we are guaranteed a government of, by and for the people. That you, or Blatham don't care for it is just TS.

Blatham wants to turn this into some debate about oil instead of staying to the topic of the thread which is the "axis of evil" statement by George Bush.
 
 
 
I asked a question in my last post regarding Bush's statement. Can you refute any of the points Bush made in his description of the 3 countries he has described as the "axis of evil"?
 

The problem is, or one central problem is, that I have been telling you from post # 1 that the framing of this question is so misleading and inexact and bound up with emotive language that is is functionally useless.

You really do need to bone up on the Project For An American Century, who was involved, and what they've written.

I have and agree with most of it. As an outline, it makes some very good points for moving forward, but that is not the discussion to be had here.

You haven't answered my question though.
 
 
Myanmar is evil. Please refute.

You still haven't answered MY question, not speaking of the first question here Blatham, but the one I asked you on page 9.
 
 
I can find no post from you on page 9. If it is the "refute" question again, I won't be bothering, for reasons given. If you remain unsure of what those reasons are, the exercise for you to engage so as to encourage understanding is for you to refute the claim that Myanmar is evil, or that South Africa is evil, or that blondes have more fun. You don't have to do it here, do it on paper while having breakfast.
 
 
You don't get off that easy Blatham. You keep repeating the same thing over and over and avoid answering a very simple question.

Bush didn't just have a press conference, come out and say "Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Iran Iraq and North Korea are the axis of evil. Good night." and you don;t get to just say "Myanmar is evil. Please refute."

That's bullshit and you know it.

I was hoping to have an actuall discussion on A2K with someone, but I guess that's too much to ask as you don't seem capable of holding up your end of the conversation.

So, I consider this discussion closed due to lack of participation and willingness on your side. Pity, it was almost interesting.
