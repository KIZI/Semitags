San Diego does not have better weather than New England! It never snows in
San Diego, it snows in New England. When was the last time SanDiego was
below zero? never. New England has days below zero.
Are you saying that you enjoy the weather in SanDiego better than I enjoy
the weather in New England?

Parts of East San Diego County (higher elevation areas) have snow.

He does have a point. San Diego will never host an ice sculpture
festival or a world cup skiing event. Of course smoking a cigar on my
patio in January in jeans and a shirt is kind of cool.

Wow, California still lets you smoke outside?

Growing up in San Diego I knew I was going to find a way to leave it when
I was in my early teens. I wanted to see the four seasons in a bad way,
and am grateful for the opportunity to leave and move to New England.

I sure have an appreciation for the "climate" in San Diego when I go back
and visit, though.

Sounds nice,  for an older gentleman. I prefer heading down a snow-covered
trail at about 50 mph on my freshly waxed skiis.

You mean ice covered don't you? Or are you talking about skiing in the
west? Everybody knows skiing back east sucks.

I lived in CT for 38 years before moving here and I will never go back
if I can help it. Traffic sucks all the time, the cost of living is
about as bad as it is here (with the exception of real estate) and
public services here are better.

I do miss the fall and Indian Summer though. Leaf peeping when the trees
were changing colors was always a favorite of mine and jumping in big
piles of leaves was tons of fun as a kid. Rakes aren't needed here so
much although once in a while I do have to prune my palm trees.

I can drive about two hours to Big Bear and ski and/or snowboard all I
want. As for my affection for cigars and three fingers (my fingers are
pretty wide though) of 12-year-old-scotch, it's an acquired taste.

My neighbor from Boston joined the Navy back in the 70's, stationed
here...... he went back for a couple of years, got married, and returned to
San Diego.... he said he'll never go back...... still a Pats fan though.

Traffic in CT, especially on I-95, is horrendous and that was before
work started on the new Quinnipiac River bridge in New Haven (also known
as the Q). Back in 2003 my wife and I had to attend a wedding in Orange.
She made a business trip out of it by meeting with a client down in
Manhattan on Monday, the day after the wedding.

Now the wedding started at 3:30 so we left the hotel on E34 St @ 12:45.
Traffic in the city wasn't bad but as soon as we entered CT 95 was a
continuous parking lot. We entered the church in Orange at 3:29 and had
to practically bowl over the bride's procession to make it to a pew
before the ceremony began.

Also, try using the 84 westbound out of Hartford during the afternoon
rush. The backup from Waterbury used to extend all the way back to the
691. Ask any long haul trucker about CT traffic and see what they say.

On summer Friday afternoons traffic on the eastbound 95 approach to the
other Q (3 lanes) would stretch all the way back to Exit 39 or 40 in
Milford. If there was any kind of weather or accident then traffic could
be at a standstill for 20 miles. Then on summer Sunday afternoons the
westbound approach (2 lanes) to the Q would back up as far as as
everyone was going home so the parking lot could extend all the way to
Madison or Clinton.

My sister is still in the New Haven area and she has told me that it's
even worse now due to construction.

Yes, the north county traffic is bad but only during rush hours. In CT I
used to have to reschedule meetings or appointments because I would be
stuck in daytime traffic. I always gave myself an extra 30 minutes to
get to where I was going but it wasn't always enough.

Yes, traffic around New Haven can be bad. I was a student at Yale 25
years ago and the traffic around New Haven was bad then. I avoid 95 as
much as possible between NYC and New Haven. Route 84 though isn't too
bad except around Hartford at rush hour. I travel that road about 50
times a year and rarely have any issues.

The worst traffic I have ever experienced though was on the west coast
in the SF bay area. OMG. 11 PM Sunday night going north from the
airport to Concord and it was backed up for 30 miles. And going south
in the morning from Concord? Yikes! After an experince with that I
always drive tot he airport the night before and stay there.

LA has been a horror show too some of the times I have visted there -
but not as bad as SF.
