"Did you know that Nerf Herder has never met or spoken with anyone from
Van Halen, the band that inspired their mid-level hit from January of
1997? It's true! The band did hear that Alex and Eddie Van Halen really
liked the song, and the band was given permission to use theirs, and
Michael Anthony and Valerie Bertinalli's images in their video for the
song. David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar refused permision, Hagar going far
enough as to call the band members "faggots." The video for "Van Halen"
was added to regular rotation on MTV and was seen by anyone who was
watching the channel at 3 in the morning. M2 played the hell out of the
song. And the rest is history."
