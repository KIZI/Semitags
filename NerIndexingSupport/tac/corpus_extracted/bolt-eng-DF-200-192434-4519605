i laughed so hard at borat the first time i saw it my face hurt and i could barely breathe
 
 
None of the above. I must be torn faced.
 
 
Argh, I want to vote for Pink Panther, but you put Ali G instead...that will not do.

I voted for Austin Powers instead. Just great and silly and surreal. Borat's great, but I couldn't watch it a lot, dunno why or what's wrong with me.
 
 
im hoping that u mean the original pink panther and not that piece of crap steve martin remake, yet another nail in steve martins creative coffin
 
 
Erm...out of those four, Austin Powers...but honestly, none of them really tickle my funny bone particularly hard...
 
 
All of them make me laugh
 
 
Rowan Atkinson; the man is a genius..
