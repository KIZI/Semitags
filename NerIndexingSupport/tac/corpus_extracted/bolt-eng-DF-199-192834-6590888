And if not, what the hell is wrong with you? Turn it on, dumbass!

The Steelers have the ball and a 16-7 lead heading into the 4th quarter. Let's go Steelers!
 
 
@kickycan,

Did you see that guy from the Ravens get popped the end of the second quarter? He got his clock cleaned...poor baby.
 
 
@mismi,

Mismi! Long time, no see! You aren't by any chance a Steelers fan, are you? I may have missed that play while I was messing around on this stupid website...
 
 
@kickycan,

Hiya Kicky...I am pulling for the Steelers. You?
edit: I read - see that you are...oops
 
 
Steelers' defense is looking fierce tonight...
 
 
@mismi,

I have been a Steelers fan since 1975. Yeah, I'm pulling for the Steelers tonight.
 
 
@kickycan,

Oh great, the minute I make a comment on how solid their defense looks...they make a bonehead play...
 
 
@kickycan,

That was a bad mistake...dammit - touchdown...Kicky - this is tight
 
 
Dammit!
 
 
@mismi,

I knew it was going to be tight. Steelers/Ravens games are always interesting, at least.
 
 
@kickycan,

oops...
 
 
@kickycan,

Ben just has to not f--- this up now...
 
 
That wasn't the worst thing that could have happened...let the defense win it. That could work.
 
 
I am a lifelong Steelers fan. It's kind of ugly out there just now.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Yes, it is starting to get a little scary.
 
 
@kickycan,

I think it's about time for Polamalu to make a huge play.
 
 
@kickycan,

Or Joey.

(oops, he's not there no more...)
 
 
@Rockhead,

Boom, there it is!!! Call me the swami from now on...
 
 
@kickycan,

That's it, this team is going to the superbowl!!!
 
 
@kickycan,

must admit it looks bleak, but...
 
 
Wow, what a collision that was. I hope Mcgahee's not seriously hurt. Yikes.
 
 
Woooooooo Hooooooo!

Here we go, Steelers....here we go!
Here we go, Steelers....here we go!
Here we go, Steelers....here we go!

Wanted the Cardinals to win today, too!

Will be a great super bowl!

^5's Kicky!
 
 
@JustBrooke,

YES! My Roethlesberger girl is here! Now we can proceed!

LET'S GO STEELERS!!!!
 
 
@kickycan,

vs.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Ha! Did you see that defense tonight? I'll be surprised if the Cardinals score at all.
 
 
@kickycan,

Care to wager?

I'll bet you the cigar Farmerman owes me for thinking the Iggles would win.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

I'd love to bet you, but I don't indulge in that filthy habit (anymore). Make it worth my while and I'll take your bet.
 
 
Great game... actually both matches. It wasn't ther type of action and results I expected, though. I had picked the Steelers to go all the way. I still do. But, I had the Panthers in the SB with them.
 
 
@Ragman,

I'm from Maryland. This is a sad night. We were sooooo close!

Stinky ol' Steelers! They almost killed one of our guys in their bloodthirty drive to win.  

Go Cardinals!  

If it can't be the black birds -- let it be the red birds!
 
 
@Lambchop,

The contact was mutual. That's how hardnosed football is played and it was a legal hit. At the same time, I hope his recovery is swift. I understand he's neurologically OK, but his neck hurts pretty bad. Ravens turned the ball over too often and Flacco threw into traffic too often.
 
 
At the start of the season I wanted the Pats to go all the way again. But with Brady sidelined for the season that didn't happen. Now I don't care. Let's go with Pissburgh.
 
 
@NickFun,

It was a good game. I hated to see the guy get hurt though. I would like to see the Steelers win. Looking forward to the Superbowl.
 
 
Congratulations to Kickycan and his Steelers.

Superbowl Champs they are...
