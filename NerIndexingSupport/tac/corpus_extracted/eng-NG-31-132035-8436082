Santa Cruz marked his birthday with Blackburn's opener

MyPa 0-1 Blackburn

Blackburn put one foot into the first round proper of the Uefa Cup
with a comfortable second qualifying round, first-leg win over MyPa in
Finland.
Roque Santa Cruz celebrated his birthday and his first Rovers start
with a well-taken goal.

Despite controlling the game, Blackburn rarely threatened to extend
their lead to make their second-leg task easier.

Blackburn keeper Brad Friedel was never extended, with Christopher
Samba and Ryan Nelsen solid in front of him.

Santa Cruz got Blackburn off to a dream start with a goal just six
minutes into his first Rovers' start.

Rovers had already served notice with less than five minutes on the
clock, with Morten Gamst Pedersen firing a free-kick straight at
keeper Janne Korhnonen, and Jason Roberts beating the offside trap to
draw another save from the keeper.

Blackburn took the lead when Roberts slipped a cute pass through the
MyPa back line for Santa Cruz to control and fire left-footed across
Korhonen and inside the far post.

Blackburn were so far ahead of the Finnish outfit in terms of
technique and tactical nous that the early exchanges were little more
than a practice match in MyPa's bucolic little ground which resembled
most Premier League clubs' training facilities.

Santa Cruz was picked out by a Stephen Warnock cross, only to plant
his header straight at Korhnonen and Rovers' chief concerns were their
failure to add to their total and the prospect of complacency letting
MyPa in.

It took the home side 23 minutes to muster their first effort of note,
with Mikko Hyyrynan's shot deflecting wide for a corner which was
easily cleared.

There was plenty of work for Korhonen, but he proved more than
capable, saving well as David Bentley and Warnock fired in long-range
shots.

Blackburn had to endure something resembling a spell of pressure
straight after the restart, with MyPa forcing a series of corners,
although at no time was Friedel in the Rovers' goal required to make
any sort of save.

The 3,000 crowd even took time out from fending off mosquitoes to get
behind their team as MyPa grew in confidence, and Christopher Samba
was forced into a last-ditch tackle to deny Eero Peltonen a shot at
goal.

Blackburn needed the cushion of a second goal to settle any nerves,
and twice MyPa almost coughed one up free of charge.

First, Toni Huttunen chested the ball past Korhonen but was relieved
as it bobbled wide of the goal, and then Tuomas Kansikas sliced a
Bentley cross over his own bar.

Substitutes Brett Emerton and Matt Derbyshire almost combined for a
second, with Korhonen parrying the Australian's shot and Derbyshire's
follow-up scrambled off the line.

*Le Mans top as Marseille struggle  Wednesday 15 August 2007

Le Mans UC 72 kept up their 100 per cent start to the Ligue 1 season
as they defeated FC Girondins de Bordeaux on a day which saw Olympique
de Marseille beaten at Valenciennes FC and Paris Saint-Germain FC's
poor start continue.

Perfect record
Le Mans are the only club in France to have won their opening three
league games, their latest three points coming in the form of a 2-1
victory at the home of previously unbeaten Bordeaux. They had to come
from behind to get them too as goals by Tulio De Melo and Grafite
cancelled out David Bellion's first-half opener for Bordeaux, who had
goalkeeper and captain Ulrich Rame dismissed on 23 minutes. AS
Nancy-Lorraine, with two wins out of two, did not play tonight.

Marseille woe
UEFA Champions League hopefuls Marseille are still looking for their
first win after falling 2-1 to Valenciennes, while PSG's first goal of
the campaign was not enough to prevent a 3-1 home rloss to an FC
Lorient team with seven points from three games. Elsewhere, AS Monaco
FC were 2-0 winners against point-less FC Metz, a position which AJ
Auxerre also still find themselves in following their 3-0 defeat at RC
Strasbourg. The other game played saw a fourth-minute Petter Hansson
goal prove enough for UEFA Cup challengers Stade Rennais FC to beat AS
Saint-Etienne 1-0.

Lyon may join battle for Heinze
Tuesday, 14 August 2007, 10:21 GMT 11:21 UK
http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6912488.stm

French champions Lyon say they may join the race to sign Manchester
United's Argentine left-back Gabriel Heinze.
He wants to sign for Liverpool and says he has a letter from United
allowing him to leave for £6.8m but they do not want to sell to their
close rivals.

Now Lyon coach Alain Perrin wants to sign the 29-year-old to replace
captain Cris, who faces six months out injured.

Perrin said: "He has the profile but it is necessary to know if he
really wants to play regularly at centre-back."

Interview: Liverpool chief exec Rick Parry

Heinze joined United from Ligue 1 side Paris St Germain for £6.9m in June 2004.

But the Argentine is currently involved in a dispute with United, who
are refusing to allow him to move to fellow north-west club Liverpool.

Once it is settled, if he is still a Man Utd player, he will be
treated accordingly

Sir Alex Ferguson

Heinze is taking the issue to a Premier League arbitration panel on 20 August.

However, United boss Sir Alex Ferguson insists Heinze has not been
made an outcast at United because of his stance.

"He has not become an alien within the squad," said Ferguson. "He is a
very popular player.

"Obviously, the meeting on 20 August will settle it one way or another.

"We think we have a good case. They probably think they have a good
case too or they wouldn't have gone this far.

"But once it is settled, if he is still a Manchester United player, he
will be treated accordingly. He is a warrior and a fighter. He won't
let us down."

Heinze has two years still remaining on his United contract.

Despite the row over his future he has vowed to "carry on like a
professional" and is continuing pre-season training with the Red
Devils.

RAG

And he met manager Ferguson at United's Carrington training ground
last week to discuss his future, having confirmed he has brought in
lawyers to try to force through a move to Anfield.

Previously, United chief executive David Gill stated he felt the club
was in the right.

"He is a contracted player for two years and unless we receive an
offer that is acceptable to us as a club, he will remain with us," he
said.

Gill added that prior to Liverpool revealing their interest, he
verbally informed Heinze's agent that United would not be prepared to
sell him to any of their three major domestic rivals.

That conversation is thought to have been recorded and, if so, could
feasibly be used as evidence if the matter ended up in court.

If he did end up at Liverpool, Heinze would become the first player to
go directly from Old Trafford to Anfield since Phil Chisnall in 1964.

Meanwhile, Ferguson has said that he wished he had signed Argentine
Carlos Tevez 12 months ago.

"In his year at West Ham, Tevez proved himself to be an absolutely top
player," commented Ferguson, who finally landed the striker this week.

"Every time I saw him playing for West Ham last year, I thought to
myself, I just wish we had done it last year.

"But there were too many complications at the time."

it's just like their playing r so poor, jarrrrrrred on my feeling,

what about Bundesliga??
i also luv Barca too much, but why they say only "Barca, Barca is,.."
hey, it's real out n out supporter of Barca!
and sometimes they spend all their time saying "Beckham is,..."! very strange!

Everton to seal Fernandes signing (Friday, 17 August 2007, 10:26 GMT 11:26 UK)
< http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/6945169.stm >
--- + --- + --- + --- + --- + --- + --- + --- + --- --- + --- + --- + --- + ---
Everton boss David Moyes is hopeful Portuguese midfielder Manuel
Fernandes will be part of his squad "within the next 24 hours".

The 21-year-old arrived in Britain on Thursday with a view to
completing a ￡6m move from Benfica.
Moyes said: "He had the first part of his medical and that will be
completed on Friday."
The Everton boss added: "I would then expect him to become an Everton
player within the next 24 hours."
The move will not been completed in time for the Portugal Under-21
player to acquire international clearance to be involved in Saturday's
match at Reading.

Everton have also had to gain clearance from the Premier League over
the signing because Fernandes is part-owned by a third party, the
Global Sports Agency.
Under Premier league rules, England's top clubs are not allowed to
field a player owned by a third party who would have the "ability
materially to influence its policies or the performance of its teams".
Everton, it is believed, are only buying 50% of the player from
Benfica, with third party companies owning the rest - however, they
will have an option to buy out the rest of the player after a fixed
period.
Fernandes spent the second part of last season on loan at Goodison
Park and did enough for manager Moyes to want to agree a permanent
deal for him.
Moyes said: "He knows all about us and we hope he will be able to hit
the ground running when he arrives.
"He knows about us and what we do, he will give us a different option.
We are playing with Lee Carsley and Phil Neville just now in the
centre of midfield and he will give us more competition there.
"But he is a different type of player, with a bit more craft. At 21 he
was a big player in the European Under-21 championships for Portugal
and we are delighted to have him."

Bayern humble sorry Bremen - Saturday 18 August 2007
< http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=572723.html >

FC Bayern Munchen gave a stark warning of intent to their Bundesliga
rivals after a 4-0 vicory against Werder Bremen while FC Schalke 04
also hit four against BV Borussia Dortmund.

Ribery penalty
Bayern began the season with a 3-0 win against FC Hansa Rostock and
Ottmar Hitzfeld's side went one better against UEFA Champions League
hopefuls Bremen after Franck Ribery put the visitors ahead from the
penalty spot on 31 minutes. Italy striker Luca Toni then scored his
second goal of the season six minutes after the restart and yet
another summer signing Hamit Alt?ntop (79) and homegrown midfielder
Andreas Ottl (87) rounded off the scoring as Thomas Schaaf's men
crashed to a disappointingly heavy home defeat.

Schalke keep touch
Schalke kept within two points of the early league leaders with a 4-1
win against Borussia Dortmund. Marcelo Bordon set the ball rolling
with an eleventh-minute opener, Christian Pander doubled the hosts'
lead (31) and Gerald Asamoah made it 3-0 just before the hour mark.
Nelson Valdez pulled one back for the visitors midway through the
second half but Kevin Kuranyi (78) completed a miserable day for
Dortmund who remain bottom after two defeats.

Stuttgart stumble
Champions VfB Stuttgart suffered a setback following last week's draw
with Schalke despite taking the lead against Hertha BSC Berlin thanks
to Thomas Hitzelsperger's strike on the quarter-hour mark. Hertha
rallied, though, with three goals after the break from Sofian Chahed
(51), Fatih (65) and Solomon Okoronkwo (81)

Wolfsburg win
VfL Wolfsburg also completed a 3-1 victory at newly-promoted MSV
Duisburg thanks to strikes from Marcelinho (41), Alexander Madlung
(51) and Sergiu Radu (72), FC Nurnberg were 2-1 winners at 1. FC Hansa
Rostock while DSC Arminia Bielefeld and Eintracht Frankfurt remain
third and fourth in the Bundesliga after sharing a 2-2 draw. On Friday
night Hannover 96 ruined Karlsruher SC's first home game back in the
top flight with a 2-1 win.

THANX A LOT!!

hi, how r U today? do U enjoy FooTBaLL??
wld U plz read my prose.

** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
[about Soccer, Owen, Klose, and more]

Owen, he's not yet.
he still trip 2 another pla... actually how's his state?
*Trio pull out of England friendly*
< http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6954644.stm >

(what about another Owen? feelin well?)

Oops! Klose injured..! do U know about it?!
*Trio withdraw from Germany squad* - http://bbc.co.uk
< http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6953820.stm >

So it is, U can't engage in any sport without getting injured
sometimes, besides i guess it was a little bit sad event.
then i guess like this, "hey... really we don't have 2 worry?"
i hope plz cover him and we 'd like 2 waiting 4 recover himself,
however we can't c when he back :-l
umm uhh...

he looked hurts so much....!
it hurts me 2 c his pain.
hey,.....

BTW i felt he's very charming striker even though he's a distracted
look with his pain.. sorry but what a beauteous, he's an attractor ;)
then over again i guess like this, if i could watch a game in there,
Now iGonnaGo2UrPlace! by UrSide!
as 4 me, truly he's one of special players who made me such feelings,

Lampard penalty spoils Torres joy
http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=574988.htm...

Fernando Torres marked his first appearance at Anfield with an
impressive debut goal for Liverpool, but it was not enough to earn his
club all three points as Frank Lampard's second half penalty grabbed
Chelsea a 1-1 draw.

Under the watchful eye of England manager Steve McClaren, Steven
Gerrard made light of the fractured toe that will almost certainly
exclude him from playing for his country against Germany in midweek by
setting up Torres' debut goal in the 16th minute.

The Liverpool captain gathered Xabi Alonso's tidy header and sent
Torres chasing away down the right with a superb pass. It still
appeared that Chelsea defender Tal Ben-Haim would deal with the
danger, but the Spaniard showed an electrifying example of his pace
and power to surge away from his marker and beat Peter Cech with a
perfect right-foot finish.

The game had already been nicely set up by Manchester United's
early-afternoon defeat at Manchester City, a result greeted pre-match
with great enthusiasm by both sets of supporters. The early goal
merely served to add to the intensity of a fixture that has become one
of the showpiece occasions on the English football calendar.

After going a goal behind, Chelsea's midfield began to exert a degree
of control. Alonso's foul on Malouda gave Liverpool an anxious moment
at the midway point of the first half, but Didier Drogba's free-kick
was deflected harmlessly behind.

Salomon Kalou appeared to have a superb shooting opportunity but took
one touch too many and was halted by Gerrard's superb sliding tackle,
and Wright-Phillips sped past Alvaro Arbeloa before his cross was
headed over by Drogba.

For the third time in as many games this season, Chelsea found
themselves a goal down but their spirited fightback raised the
temperature of the contest yet further, although they might not have
emerged with a point had Riise's spectacular volley, from Pennant's
67th minute pull-back, found its mark.

The last chances of an entertaining game fell to Kuyt, who rose to
meet Finnan's right-wing cross but steered his effort inches over the
crossbar, and substitute Ryan Babel who unleashed a ferocious
long-range drive into the side-netting.

England 1-2 Germany (Wednesday, 22 August 2007, 20:59 GMT 21:59 UK)
By Andrew McKenzie
< http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6954720.stm >

England suffered a first loss at the new Wembley as Germany took
advantage of a mistake by keeper Paul Robinson.

The hosts took an early lead when Micah Richards' run ended with Frank
Lampard beating Jens Lehmann at his near post.

But Robinson made a hash of a Bernd Schneider cross to allow Kevin
Kuranyi to tap home before Christian Pander drilled an unstoppable
shot past him.

England had the chances to level but Michael Owen, Kieron Dyer and
Frank Lampard all failed to capitalise.

England suffered defeat at the hands of Germany in their last game at
the old Wembley and their old rivals made it a notable double in front
of a sell-out at the new £800m national stadium.

With two crucial Euro 2008 qualifiers just around the corner the
friendly gave coach Steve McClaren more problems than answers.

It had all started so promising with McClaren's decision to give a
fifth start to 19-year-old defender Richards at right-back paying
instant dividends.

The Manchester City player has been tipped to eventually settle as a
central defender but he gave a decent impression of a right winger as
he created the opener.

He showed some neat footwork as he cut inside Pander and slipped a
pass through for the advancing Lampard, with the Chelsea midfielder
ending an 12-month international goal drought by driving a shot past
Lehmann.

The Arsenal keeper has had a dreadful start to the season but
fortunately for him his opposite number relieved some of the pressure
on him with a howler 15 minutes later.

Robinson had kept out a shot from Thomas Hitzlsperger in the lead-up
to the goal.

But when Nick Shorey's clearance fell at the feet of Schneider his
cross caught out the Tottenham keeper, who could only push the ball
into the path of a grateful Kuranyi.

The setback seemed to knock the wind out of England after what had
been a reasonable start to the game, with Richards and Joe Cole
offering plenty of width.

England could have restored their lead when a David Beckham free-kick
was flicked on by Alan Smith but was just out of John Terry's reach.

Lampard could have got a second when he was put through by Beckham but
Lehmann saved with his legs.

Instead it was Germany who went in front - and this time there was
nothing Robinson could have done.

Pander, who had been caught out for England's goal, made amends on his
international debut when he ventured forward and cracked home an
unstoppable left-foot strike.

Michael Owen wasted two chances to level things up before the
interval, when Lehmann showed his Jekyll and Hyde characteristics.

First of all he denied an Owen header with a brilliant reflex stop,
but then he gifted the England striker the easiest of opportunities
only for him to fire over an unguarded net.

Robinson's misery was cut short when he made way at half-time for the
recalled David James.

It was the start of the usual raft of substitutions which only seems
to disrupt England's far-from-free-flowing game.

Kieron Dyer almost made his mark when he was set-up by Beckham only to
sidefoot past the upright.

Shaun Wright-Phillips - another second-half arrival - crossed for
Lampard only for him to volley off target and sum up another dreary
evening for England fans.

McClaren has talked about making their new home their fortress, but
England will go into their next game, the Euro 2008 qualifier against
Israel on 8 September, still looking for a first win there.

OH!! REAL-GREAT!!!!
Robben!! reallllllyyy?!!
HE'S BiG PLAYER ;)))

*Robben set to complete Real move
< http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6959579.stm >

Arjen Robben is poised to complete a move to Real Madrid after the
Spanish champions agreed a fee with Chelsea.

The 23-year-old winger has been linked with the Bernabeu outfit for
most of the summer but the fee appeared to be a sticking point between
the clubs.

However, Chelsea announced that the transfer had been settled subject
to the Dutchman agreeing personal terms on a five-year deal and
passing a medical.

The transfer fee is thought to be in the region of £21m.

The announcement came on a busy day for Real, who agreed a deal for
Manchester United's Gabriel Heinze as well as the sale of Cicinho to
Roma.

Robben has been at Chelsea since joining from PSV Eindhoven in 2004,
scoring 19 goals in 104 appearances at Stamford Bridge.

However, Real president Ramon Calderon repeatedly expressed an
interest in bringing the winger to the Bernabeu.

This summer, Robben was offered a new Chelsea contract but opted
instead to push for a move to the Spanish capital.

He will join fellow Dutchmen Ruud van Nistelrooy, Wesley Sneijder and
Royston Drenthe at the Bernabeu.
