Do ya'll have a t.v. show called Monk in the UK? It is about an obsessive compulsive detective.
 
 
Yep, it is aired on saturdays. Tis a very good series, although I do think making it a comedy was maybe not the best thing to do.

It's not a comedy. It just happens to be funny at times.

When I am watching I get a feel that some scenes are created to make people laugh, although it does not detract from the greatness of the idea.
 
 
So do ya'll have a new season starting this month?

I'm guessing that it is one that has already aired in the US.

if it were not then something would be wrong. I think we haven't yet finished the first series yet, but we are close to the end I think.
