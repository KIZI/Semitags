Bachmann is in one week, the dirt starts surfacing. Palin has been putting up with this for 2 1/2 years. Still nothing. Bachmann is fixing to see the wrath of the liberal MSM and she will be looked at under a electron microscope. This is why Palin is going to come out shining because she has been vetted and has been vetted a second time and still, she has come out a winner. Romney has yet to be vetted like Palin. Same goes to Pawlenty but one thing is clear. There is something about a conservative woman that causes the media to go into search and destroy mode. Bachmann will be out of this race before you know it.

 Michele Bachmann | Earmarks | Tea Party | The Daily Caller 

Bachmann may also be plagued by her involvement in a controversial pardon. In 2007, Bachmann wrote a letter requesting a presidential pardon for a convicted drug-smuggler and money-launderer named Frank Vennes. Vennes was convicted of money laundering in 1988 and pleaded no contest to a cocaine and weapons charge. Making matters worse, he and his wife donated a total of $27,600 to Bachmanns 2006 and 2008 election.

Bachmanns penchant for earmarks dates back to her days in the Minnesota state Senate. Despite her reputation as a fiscal conservative, from 2001-2006, then-state Senator Bachmann proposed more than $60 million in earmarks, including a $710,000 Bond For Centerville Local Improvements Around Highway 14″ and a $40,000,000 Bond for Lino Lakes And Columbus Township Highway Interchanges.

Yeah.... your side doesn't do that at all, does it?

What a bunch of bullshit. You want the Democratic Party to lie down and just let the Conservatives be the bastions of Political Wrangling.

Both sides do it. One side tends to rely on facts more than another... Muslim, Kenyan, America-hater, anti-American... does any of that ring a bell? Or did we forget about all of that now that it's a new election cycle?

Bachmann's and Palin's words and actions are now a matter of public record and subject to scrutiny. Stop playing the "victim". Every politician makes their bed, and they all have to lie in it.
 
 
 
Bachmann's and Palin's words and actions are now a matter of public record and subject to scrutiny.

 

Why should Palin be scrutinized? She's not running for anything. She's a private citizen.
 
 
Because she's a Public figure that is neck deep in politics. She chose her own path. No one forced her Bus Trip, or her book deals, or her TV show on her.

She could have finished her term in Alaska and retired nicely to a life of comfort. She didn't choose that path. She chose to be the face of the Tea Party... with that comes scrutiny. The people of ACORN are Private Citizens, but they(as a group) have been crucified by your side for half a decade(that I was aware of).

Charlie Sheen is a Private citizen... shouldn't he be allowed to continue his downward spiral of drugs, alcohol and Porn Stars? Sure... but that's not the way the world works, is it?

yes well, as it turns out you should have been watching weenie and tweenie.

WTF does that mean?

Edit... I googled it. I still don't understand the connection to Bachmann and Palin... or even the general political connection.... but thanks for playing!

She's guilty of being Conservative While Female.
 
 
Big deal. All the candidates have to deal with intense scrutiny. It's part of the process. I wish the press had done a better job vetting Obama....

One of the reasons that House and Senate members rarely make it to POTUS is that they have too many votes on record and the opposition has endless ways to spin those votes. There are literally hundreds of votes every session. The average Joe doesn't understand the machinations of the sausage making machine in DC. They see a vote for or against something and naturally assume that is the persons position on the issue. But because the system is so archaic and inane, these legislators have to make a compromises to get things done. Sometimes a legislator will vote yes on a bill one day, then no on the same bill (with a rider or add-on) the next day.
 
 
Have they mentioned the outrage of Bachmann accepting government money - for her foster children? Personally, I find that outrageous. Imagine - taking parentless children into your home and 'profiting' from it!!!! Fucking bitch!

Bachmanns Vetting Begins: The Dirt Surfaces---Earmarks, Farm Subsidies And Pardons.

 

Did Weiner send her a picture of his Weiner?
 
 
 
Bachmann is in one week, the dirt starts surfacing. Palin has been putting up with this for 2 1/2 years. Still nothing. Bachmann is fixing to see the wrath of the liberal MSM

 

Now, of course, all this dirt was dug up by the GOP so therefore the "Liberal" MSM is to blame!!!  
You do know that the Daily Caller is a CON$ervative website, don't you?
Oopsie!

May 16, 2011
RUSH: Let's move to this whole notion here of what's happening inside the Republican field and the fact that opposition research is now being conducted on Michele Bachmann. There is a little game -- I don't know if you've noticed this, but if you haven't noticed it, don't doubt me. Part of my job is to notice things before you do, and then tell you. It's called the cutting edge. I'm on it. I own it. There's a little game being played by the established Republican commentariate, what I call the inside-the-Beltway conservative intelligentsia, the Republican intellectual elite. It is aimed at muddling conservatism and discrediting, taking down, if you will, conservative Tea Party candidates in the Republican presidential primary process.

RUSH: Now, let's look at Bachmann, just a quick peek here at Michele Bachmann. She is a favored target of establishment Washington. Now, that doesn't come as a surprise to you, does it? I mean you know that she's a target, you've seen it. It might perplex you as to why at this stage of the game. Look, I know we are in the Republican primaries and the battle is between ourselves now. It's understandable. But in establishment Washington Bachmann is a favorite target, and even to the point of talking about she's too short or she's radical or what have you. But in this case, in the Daily Caller piece, the attack on her is that she supported earmarks and ethanol.
 
 
Yeah... but it's only when their candidates get legitimately scrutinized that they bitch. When the Right winger Media makes up bullshit stories about people being closet Communists, Kenyan Muslims, and all the rest of the crap that gets vomited from these scumbags... they all do a happy dance.
 
 
What happened to Sarah Palin and her family was not vetting. It was the game of personal destruction and there is no other way to see it. Problem is the left hasn't been able to destroy her, she beats them at their own game.
 
 
You guys do know she was an IRS lawyer right?
 
 
 
Bachmann is in one week, the dirt starts surfacing. Palin has been putting up with this for 2 1/2 years. Still nothing. Bachmann is fixing to see the wrath of the liberal MSM and she will be looked at under a electron microscope. This is why Palin is going to come out shining because she has been vetted and has been vetted a second time and still, she has come out a winner. Romney has yet to be vetted like Palin. Same goes to Pawlenty but one thing is clear. There is something about a conservative woman that causes the media to go into search and destroy mode. Bachmann will be out of this race before you know it.

 Michele Bachmann | Earmarks | Tea Party | The Daily Caller 

Bachmann may also be plagued by her involvement in a controversial pardon. In 2007, Bachmann wrote a letter requesting a presidential pardon for a convicted drug-smuggler and money-launderer named Frank Vennes. Vennes was convicted of money laundering in 1988 and pleaded no contest to a cocaine and weapons charge. Making matters worse, he and his wife donated a total of $27,600 to Bachmanns 2006 and 2008 election.

Bachmanns penchant for earmarks dates back to her days in the Minnesota state Senate. Despite her reputation as a fiscal conservative, from 2001-2006, then-state Senator Bachmann proposed more than $60 million in earmarks, including a $710,000 Bond For Centerville Local Improvements Around Highway 14″ and a $40,000,000 Bond for Lino Lakes And Columbus Township Highway Interchanges.

More In Link.

 

If that's all there is to the pardon story, that is certainly alarming. I don't like politicians that can have a position bought.

The earmarks are unfortunately the norm and don't mean squat. Although I wish the practice was banned.

I don't know a lot about her yet, but what I do know is admirable.
 
 
It's part of the game that's played by both sides. Bachmann - as all candidates - knows what's in her closet and that it will likely be brought up by the opposition, and then you deal with it and see where the chips fall.
 
 
 
Yeah... but it's only when their candidates get legitimately scrutinized that they bitch. When the Right winger Media makes up bullshit stories about people being closet Communists, Kenyan Muslims, and all the rest of the crap that gets vomited from these scumbags... they all do a happy dance.

 

Ahh...so speculating that Trig Palin is Sarah's grandson fathered by her husband is legitimate scrutiny?

Gee, I remember during the 2010 election campaign and after the GOP gaining power "earmarks" were the scourge of the Earth. Now suddenly that Teabagger Moochele Bachmann is an earmarker, earmarks don't matter. Moochele Bachmann hates earmarks. Despises them. On her website, she calls the earmark system "little more than a political favor factory at taxpayer expense." But her earmarks, of course, are not earmarks because they are small earmarks, so she is not a hypocrite!  

 Bachmann says she did take earmarks after all | Minnesota Independent: News. Politics. Media. 

Just days after saying she had requested zero earmarks for her district, Rep. Michele Bachmann admitted to Fox News Brian Wilson that she had indeed requested millions in earmarks in 2008. But, she says, its not a big deal because her earmarks were less than the average earmarks for the rest of Minnesotas congressional delegation.
 
 
 
Yeah.... your side doesn't do that at all, does it?

What a bunch of bullshit. You want the Democratic Party to lie down and just let the Conservatives be the bastions of Political Wrangling.

Ok... great... there's one. Hardly can call that equal, can we?

 

Your side sure does invest a lot of emotional energy into destroying Palin. You'll do the exact same thing to Bachmann. Not politically -- personally. "Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it."

And you won't see anything wrong with it.

As I stated "i don't know a lot about her" so your criticism of my post is misguided at best.
As to ear marks I've never taken a hardline position either way other than I wish they were banned. If every congressman was removed for earmarks we wouldn't have any representatives left. So its kind of a pointless debate in the big picture.
 
 
How about Bachmann gets 'scrutinized' to the same degree that Barack Obama was in his run for the presidency?

Fair enough?

How about Bachmann gets 'scrutinized' to the same degree that Barack Obama was in his run for the presidency?

Fair enough?

 

You mean zero, at least by the media?
 
 
Liberals aren't smart enough to understand the simplicity of this election.
Bachmann, Palenty and Santorum are all from the key region of the country. One of them wins the nomination and can pull Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the Republicans have The White House.
That simple.
 
 
 
 
 
Bachmann's and Palin's words and actions are now a matter of public record and subject to scrutiny.

 

Why should Palin be scrutinized? She's not running for anything. She's a private citizen.

 

She's guilty of being Conservative While Female.

 

And what's your victimology explanation for why liberals attack conservative white males?
 
 
 
How about Bachmann gets 'scrutinized' to the same degree that Barack Obama was in his run for the presidency?

Fair enough?

 

Sure...

But lets see how the media (and the left) react if it is found that she kicked off her first political campaign at the house of a man who was involved with a vilent anti government group.

Or lets see how the media reacts (and the left) if it is found that she belonged to a religious congregation that had some (not all) sermons that were filled with hate

Or lets see how the media (and the left) react if it is found that she had conducted her only business deal with a convected felon.

Sure...he was scrutinized by the right....for very valid concerns...but the media (and the left) did not care.

Lets see what is really important to the left as it pertains to the character of a candidate.

But I dont disagree with your assumption.....most on the right will ignore thoise issues just as most on the left ignored them with Obama.
The only difference is,I believe...and we shall see if I am right....that the media will dig deep into the issue with a GOP candidate where they really downplayed them with Mr. Obama.

With GOP candidates...they investigate...and do whatever they can to make the story stink...even if it doesnt.

Please show me where the big three....ABC, NBC or CBS interviewed members of the wirght congregation....as they interviewed members of Palins home town.

daveman says the media didn't scrutinize Obama at ALL.

So I guess in a year of Limbaugh, Hannity, Foxnews, etc., none of them did any scrutiny of Obama. None of them put any investigative reporters on the air. None of them did any in depth stories about Wright, or Ayers, or the president's birthplace. Nothing.

lol.

Lets see what is really important to the left as it pertains to the character of a candidate.

 

So you're assuring us that the Right, because of its superior fair and balanced-ness, will 'care' about the dirt dug up on Michele Bachmann.

 

Someone should look into your background.
 
 
 
 
Yes, let's hope we don't see too much of THIS...

 Michele Bachmann calls Sarah Palin a bad mother - Minneapolis News - The Blotter 

     

 

Yea, let's hope not..... people writing bullshit in blogs and fucking morons falling for whatever crap suits their 'side'.

 

Yes, by all means, let's not post verbatim quotes or video clips. Like Newt said anyone who quotes him will be lying.

lol

He is correct.

daveman says the media didn't scrutinize Obama at ALL.

So I guess in a year of Limbaugh, Hannity, Foxnews, etc., none of them did any scrutiny of Obama. None of them put any investigative reporters on the air. None of them did any in depth stories about Wright, or Ayers, or the president's birthplace. Nothing.

lol.

 

Sure they did.
But they are cable and syndicated shows..

What about the big three? DO they no longer believe scrutinizing our presidential candidates is necessary?

Forget it....the stats are the stats.....you can argue all you want.

You want the truth....go to the sttats presented by the Pew Research Center....Im not playing this game with you anymore.
 
 
 
 
Yeah... but it's only when their candidates get legitimately scrutinized that they bitch. When the Right winger Media makes up bullshit stories about people being closet Communists, Kenyan Muslims, and all the rest of the crap that gets vomited from these scumbags... they all do a happy dance.

 

Ahh...so speculating that Trig Palin is Sarah's grandson fathered by her husband is legitimate scrutiny?

 

well, to morons lilke steelstupid it is obviously.
 
 
 
 
 
Sure...

But lets see how the media (and the left) react if it is found that she kicked off her first political campaign at the house of a man who was involved with a vilent anti government group.

Or lets see how the media reacts (and the left) if it is found that she belonged to a religious congregation that had some (not all) sermons that were filled with hate

Or lets see how the media (and the left) react if it is found that she had conducted her only business deal with a convected felon.

Sure...he was scrutinized by the right....for very valid concerns...but the media (and the left) did not care.

Who ever claimed it was?

 

 Wonkette  pushed the incest bullshit.  Others   have , too.  Andrew Sullivan  insists Trig is Sarah's grandson.  Joy Behar  buys into it. So do other  idiot leftist  -- including the   CBC

Brilliant response.
What are you, 15 ?
You obviously fear attractive, successful women. Been laid yet?
My guess is no.
 
 
 
How about Bachmann gets 'scrutinized' to the same degree that Barack Obama was in his run for the presidency?

Fair enough?

 

oh for usre, and if we find she sat in a church that screamed God Damn America for 20 years, hang out with Bill Ayres, worked as a "community organizer" was an ACORN attorney, had a friend in federal penn named Reznik,, we'll elect her. She'll be perfect. Right?

But I dont disagree with your assumption.....most on the right will ignore thoise issues just as most on the left ignored them with Obama.
The only difference is,I believe...and we shall see if I am right....that the media will dig deep into the issue with a GOP candidate where they really downplayed them with Mr. Obama.

 

Is daveman full of shit for claiming that the media did zero 'scrutiny' of Obama during the 2008 campaign?

 

No. Remember, you don't consider Fox News to be legitimate media. None of the left's outlets vetted Obama.

If Bachman had those credentials, she'd be OK with Liberals. Remember, the bigger the fuck-up you are, the more they embrace you. Look how they love Bill Clinton.
 
 
 
 
 
Why should Palin be scrutinized? She's not running for anything. She's a private citizen.

 

She's guilty of being Conservative While Female.

 

And what's your victimology explanation for why liberals attack conservative white males?

 

it is because they are conservative white males. exactly, white people are evil. expecially white republican people, they are almost as bad as black Republican people..

Yeah.... your side doesn't do that at all, does it?

What a bunch of bullshit. You want the Democratic Party to lie down and just let the Conservatives be the bastions of Political Wrangling.

Both sides do it. One side tends to rely on facts more than another... Muslim, Kenyan, America-hater, anti-American... does any of that ring a bell? Or did we forget about all of that now that it's a new election cycle?

Bachmann's and Palin's words and actions are now a matter of public record and subject to scrutiny. Stop playing the "victim". Every politician makes their bed, and they all have to lie in it.

 

Yes, the cons are so unfair.

Oh, MSNBC had some stories:

 Wright says 'Jews' keeping him from Obama - Politics - White House - msnbc.com 

 Obama's ex-pastor: Media used me - Politics - Decision '08 - msnbc.com

"The more it makes Palin look bad, the truer it is!!"
 
 
 
Bachmann is in one week, the dirt starts surfacing. Palin has been putting up with this for 2 1/2 years. Still nothing. Bachmann is fixing to see the wrath of the liberal MSM and she will be looked at under a electron microscope. This is why Palin is going to come out shining because she has been vetted and has been vetted a second time and still, she has come out a winner. Romney has yet to be vetted like Palin. Same goes to Pawlenty but one thing is clear. There is something about a conservative woman that causes the media to go into search and destroy mode. Bachmann will be out of this race before you know it.

 Michele Bachmann | Earmarks | Tea Party | The Daily Caller 

Bachmann may also be plagued by her involvement in a controversial pardon. In 2007, Bachmann wrote a letter requesting a presidential pardon for a convicted drug-smuggler and money-launderer named Frank Vennes. Vennes was convicted of money laundering in 1988 and pleaded no contest to a cocaine and weapons charge. Making matters worse, he and his wife donated a total of $27,600 to Bachmanns 2006 and 2008 election.

Bachmanns penchant for earmarks dates back to her days in the Minnesota state Senate. Despite her reputation as a fiscal conservative, from 2001-2006, then-state Senator Bachmann proposed more than $60 million in earmarks, including a $710,000 Bond For Centerville Local Improvements Around Highway 14″ and a $40,000,000 Bond for Lino Lakes And Columbus Township Highway Interchanges.

More In Link.

 

Funny thing is, I have no problem with any elected official going after tax money for their state or district. That is a main part of their job, to bring some of the funds that go out back to their districts. What I hate is the fact that so much is made about earmarks when they are a relatively small part of any budget, and the funds are actually there to be spent. If my representative doesn't get any of that money back to my district, it's just going somewhere else, so they better be doing their job. It is funny though, when politicians rail against earmarks and then do whatever they can to get their fair share of them.

She'd get a fairer look from Fox than from the left-dominated media:
On Wednesday, the more liberal Project for Excellence in Journalism reported their breakdown of cable news coverage of the election, and it showed MSNBC was overwhelmingly tilted against John McCain and in favor of Barack Obama. Nearly three-fourths (73%) of MSNBCs McCain coverage was negative, compared to just 10% positive. For Obama, the good press outweighed the bad by a greater than 3-1 margin, 43% to 14%.

On CNN, McCain faced nearly five-to-one more bad news than good (13% positive vs. 61% negative), while Obama received much more balanced treatment  36% positive stories vs. 39% negative stories.

In contrast, the Fox News Channel treated both candidates to roughly the same level of good and bad press, with Obama earning just slightly better press than McCain. One-fourth of Obama stories on Fox (25%) were positive, compared to 22% of McCains coverage. Both candidates received exactly the same proportion of negative stories on FNC, 40%.

All this talk about the leftist media, lamestream media, media gives dems a pass, etc. Isn't fox the biggest media outlet out there??? Why did they 'give' the President a pass?
 
 
The simple difference between Bachmann and Palin: Bachmann appears to have a brain.
 
 
Doncha all wish the media had vetted President BO?
 
 
 
Have they mentioned the outrage of Bachmann accepting government money - for her foster children? Personally, I find that outrageous. Imagine - taking parentless children into your home and 'profiting' from it!!!! Fucking bitch!

*sacrasm off*

That's what News is supposed to do... report stories. Amazing that you guys aren't complaining about the MSM when it comes to Weiner.... he's a Progressive and he legitimately did something wrong and he's paying for it... Charlie Rangel.... much the same. Wow...imagine that.

What you want is the witch hunt that YOUR side's media pulled on the Current President to happen across the board, which is bullshit because most of those Tidbits you threw out were misinformation from the right.

If nobody knew anything about it, because the media covered it up, why didn't he just let it go?
 
 
 
 
 
Ahh...so speculating that Trig Palin is Sarah's grandson fathered by her husband is legitimate scrutiny?

 

Ok... great... there's one. Hardly can call that equal, can we?

 

Your side sure does invest a lot of emotional energy into destroying Palin. You'll do the exact same thing to Bachmann. Not politically -- personally. "Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it."

And you won't see anything wrong with it.

 

Bullshit.... The only thing you have is the trig palin thing, and that came from an INTERNET BLOG(IIRC). Not some main stream media source. Just about everything else is political in nature... like her complete lack of knowledge and preparedness for answering the tough questions.

You guys, on the other hand, you laud the efforts of Rush, Beck and Hannity who Always go into personal attack mode... Democrats are Communists in disguise, Obama is a freedom hating Kenyan Muslim who wasn't born in this country and is a disciple of Rev. Wright.... He also wants to kill Grandma and eats babies for breakfast(the last one I made up).

and you don't see anything wrong with it.

The fact is that Bachmann's record comes up, and you guys are already playing the "Victim" card this early speaks volumes about the candidate's actual worthiness of the job she is running for... which is quite simply.... nil. THis has nothing to do with personal vendetta... this has to do with her past... which comes up. Ask John Edwards, ask John Kerry, ask anyone that has played the political game. It's not victimization, it's bringing things to the forefront that we base our decisions upon.

My only request is that we keep these things factual and not spread lies and misinformation through our media. Report the news straight up and leave opinion programs and columns express their opinion.... but let it be known by the home company(FOX, MSNBC, etc) that Opinion is not necessarily fact.
 
 
 
 
 
She'd get a fairer look from Fox than from the left-dominated media:
On Wednesday, the more liberal Project for Excellence in Journalism reported their breakdown of cable news coverage of the election, and it showed MSNBC was overwhelmingly tilted against John McCain and in favor of Barack Obama. Nearly three-fourths (73%) of MSNBCs McCain coverage was negative, compared to just 10% positive. For Obama, the good press outweighed the bad by a greater than 3-1 margin, 43% to 14%.

On CNN, McCain faced nearly five-to-one more bad news than good (13% positive vs. 61% negative), while Obama received much more balanced treatment  36% positive stories vs. 39% negative stories.

In contrast, the Fox News Channel treated both candidates to roughly the same level of good and bad press, with Obama earning just slightly better press than McCain. One-fourth of Obama stories on Fox (25%) were positive, compared to 22% of McCains coverage. Both candidates received exactly the same proportion of negative stories on FNC, 40%.

I refuted this once before. You should have paid attention.

 

Michelle Bachman - running for President. Wealthy, successful, attractive, successful businesswoman and member of Congress.

What did you accomplish this week?

 

So it's unfair for the media to investigate Michele Bachmann in the same way Barack Obama has been investigated because I'm not rich.

Good one. You're really racking up quite a first impression around here.
 
 
 
What's there to "Vet".... she and Palin have the same overarching problem.... tits. It's an immediate disqualifying factor for those of us who are actually Conservatives.

 

What year is it? 2011?

Oh, yeah. You're an idiot.
 
 
 
 
 
He is not FOS.

He is correct.

The MSM did not scrutinize...they simply reported the story.

 

daveman says the media didn't scrutinize Obama at ALL.

So I guess in a year of Limbaugh, Hannity, Foxnews, etc., none of them did any scrutiny of Obama. None of them put any investigative reporters on the air. None of them did any in depth stories about Wright, or Ayers, or the president's birthplace. Nothing.

lol.

 

Like I said, you don't consider Limbaugh, Hannity, Foxnews, etc. to be media. Do you?

 

You need to look up the word media and see what it consists of.

You're denying that there was media scrutiny of the birther thing?

Seriously?
 
 
 
 
 
Oh, so I can expect Foxnews' primetime lineup to be scrutinizing Bachmann exactly the same way they scrutinized Obama?

lol

No, you feel that you refuted it once before.

The MSM wanted Obama to win. Undeniably.
 
 
 
 
 
Ah yes, that explains how nice the left has always been with Limbaugh, Hannity, Beck, O'reilly.

 

Damn, you're stupid. "Not nearly as viscous" doesn't mean "nice", you moron.

 

So someone like Olbermann was nicer to Glen Beck than to Palin?

lol

 

I don't know. I don't watch irrational, angry moonbats. You tell me.

What did you accomplish this week?

 

He "raised awareness" on the internet.  
 
 
 
 
Bachmann's and Palin's words and actions are now a matter of public record and subject to scrutiny.

 

Why should Palin be scrutinized? She's not running for anything. She's a private citizen.

 

So you finally jumped off the Palin for President bus eh?

Told you that dumb bitch would never run.
 
 
 
Bachmann is in one week, the dirt starts surfacing. Palin has been putting up with this for 2 1/2 years. Still nothing. Bachmann is fixing to see the wrath of the liberal MSM and she will be looked at under a electron microscope. This is why Palin is going to come out shining because she has been vetted and has been vetted a second time and still, she has come out a winner. Romney has yet to be vetted like Palin. Same goes to Pawlenty but one thing is clear. There is something about a conservative woman that causes the media to go into search and destroy mode. Bachmann will be out of this race before you know it.

 Michele Bachmann | Earmarks | Tea Party | The Daily Caller 

Bachmann may also be plagued by her involvement in a controversial pardon. In 2007, Bachmann wrote a letter requesting a presidential pardon for a convicted drug-smuggler and money-launderer named Frank Vennes. Vennes was convicted of money laundering in 1988 and pleaded no contest to a cocaine and weapons charge. Making matters worse, he and his wife donated a total of $27,600 to Bachmanns 2006 and 2008 election.

Bachmanns penchant for earmarks dates back to her days in the Minnesota state Senate. Despite her reputation as a fiscal conservative, from 2001-2006, then-state Senator Bachmann proposed more than $60 million in earmarks, including a $710,000 Bond For Centerville Local Improvements Around Highway 14″ and a $40,000,000 Bond for Lino Lakes And Columbus Township Highway Interchanges.

So, examining someone's legislative record is a witchhunt, but obsessing over a birth certificate for two years even though one had been provided is "due dillagence"?

Gotta hand it to you, Army, your comic relief is much appreciated.
 
 
So here's the rightwing line in this thread:

Bachmann's voting record - not fair game
Obama's voting record - fair game

Bachmann's religious history - not fair game
Obama's religious history - fair game

Bachmann's personal associations - not fair game
Obama's personal associations - fair game

Personally I think it's great that the Right thinks the only thing that can crush Bachmann's presidential chances is an 'unfair' scrutiny of who and what she actually is.

That's funny.
 
 
 
 
 
Bachmann's and Palin's words and actions are now a matter of public record and subject to scrutiny.

The best part of this thread is that USMB's number one Palin fan just happens to bring up the 'dirt' on Palin's number one rival.
 
 
 
 
 
If you weren't so lazy, you wouldn't have to rely on the media....

 

If you'll remember, the media didn't do it's job in checking out Obama. A lot of people had questions, and the liberal media ignored them.

The hardest-hitting question the lib media asked Senator Obama was, "So, tell us, Senator -- just exactly how awesome ARE you?"  

 

So why did Obama feel compelled to make a speech repudiating Rev. Wright,

if the media never made anything of that relationship?

If nobody knew anything about it, because the media covered it up, why didn't he just let it go?

 

I expect the public's awareness of the issue was primarily due to Fox.

And you can't even see the larger question there.

Why didn't Obama repudiate Wright until he was called out on it? Do you think that was at all sincere? Hardly. "I'm sorry I got caught." That's all it was.

But it was good enough for you, wasn't it? Must not question The One!!

Bullshit.... The only thing you have is the trig palin thing, and that came from an INTERNET BLOG(IIRC). Not some main stream media source.

 

Keep reading. I already proved you wrong.

 
Just about everything else is political in nature... like her complete lack of knowledge and preparedness for answering the tough questions.

You guys, on the other hand, you laud the efforts of Rush, Beck and Hannity who Always go into personal attack mode... Democrats are Communists in disguise, Obama is a freedom hating Kenyan Muslim who wasn't born in this country and is a disciple of Rev. Wright.... He also wants to kill Grandma and eats babies for breakfast(the last one I made up).

and you don't see anything wrong with it.

The fact is that Bachmann's record comes up, and you guys are already playing the "Victim" card this early speaks volumes about the candidate's actual worthiness of the job she is running for... which is quite simply.... nil.

 

What were Obama's qualifications? Oh, yeah -- "It's time!"

 
THis has nothing to do with personal vendetta... this has to do with her past... which comes up. Ask John Edwards, ask John Kerry, ask anyone that has played the political game. It's not victimization, it's bringing things to the forefront that we base our decisions upon.

 

And I have no problem with that. At all.

 
My only request is that we keep these things factual and not spread lies and misinformation through our media. Report the news straight up and leave opinion programs and columns express their opinion.... but let it be known by the home company(FOX, MSNBC, etc) that Opinion is not necessarily fact.

 

Again, agreed.

But the left's track record with keeping things factual and not spreading lies and misinformation through the media, especially where conservative women are concerned, is pretty damn thin.

Hell, you even ate Hillary alive once Obama announced.

Since the president has yet to actually do anything that could be attributed to the alleged bad influence of the Reverend Wright,

I guess I was right then, wasnt' I?

Make up your mind.

I dunno about that, but, save a few questions as to what sport Obama likes or what is his favorite pizza is, no media outlet save Fox raised any question of substance about the man. If not for Fox, we'd know nothing of the fact that Obama was personally mentored by a hardcore, avowed Communist, or that he spent 10 years soaking up Black Separatist theology preached by a racist, or that he was involved in a sleazy land deal with a convicted crook, or that he started his political career on the coattails of an unrepentant domestic terrorist.

PALIN DECISION ON PRESIDENCY EXPECTED NEXT WEEK!!

 The American Spectator : AmSpecBlog : Palin Decision Expected Next Week 

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is expected within a week to make a decision on whether to enter the 2012 presidential campaign, according to one Republican source.

Vendors of campaign services who hope to work for Team Palin have been told that Palin, the 2008 GOP vice-presidential candidate, will decide soon one way or another on mounting a 2012 campaign.

I'm in the oil and gas drilling business. That's why I support her. She will lift the moritorium so I can get some of my rigs back to drilling here in South Louisiana.
 
 
 
You're destined to go through life bitter and disappointed, kid.

 

Better to be bitter and disappointed in this this life than to be blistered and disemboweled in the next one.

Yeah. You both seem to view women as property.

That's nothing I have to worry about.
 
 
 
Yeah. You both seem to view women as property.

 

I won't speak for Sunni but you would be incorrect in terms of my viewpoint. The problem being that instead of fighting for equality, the women's movement has sought Sameness with Men. I don't want to totally derail the thread, but they're not the same thing.

I see Men and women as opposite sides of the same coin. Which side of the coin is worth more than the other?.... Neither. In fact without both sides the coin has no value at all.

The problem is that instead of understanding that one quarter and twenty-five pennies have equal value, the women's movement has fought to view them both as exactly the same. That sounds great until you need twenty-five cents for the vending machine, and all you have is twenty-five pennies instead of a quarter.

 
That's not conservatism. That's misogyny.

 

I would suggest to you that to be one of those you must inately be the other to a certain degree.
 
 
 
That's nothing I have to worry about.

 

Best of luck with that, dave.

Your side sure does invest a lot of emotional energy into destroying Palin. You'll do the exact same thing to Bachmann. Not politically -- personally. "Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it."

And you won't see anything wrong with it.

 

i fail to see how the right doesnt do this as well.
You guys are getting upset over the normal process.

change your tampons

 

So, instead of wanting to do better, you choose to wallow in the filth. Good job.

 

where did i say this?
 
 
 
 
Yeah. You both seem to view women as property.

 

I won't speak for Sunni but you would be incorrect in terms of my viewpoint. The problem being that instead of fighting for equality, the women's movement has sought Sameness with Men. I don't want to totally derail the thread, but they're not the same thing.

I see Men and women as opposite sides of the same coin. Which side of the coin is worth more than the other?.... Neither. In fact without both sides the coin has no value at all.

The problem is that instead of understanding that one quarter and twenty-five pennies have equal value, the women's movement has fought to view them both as exactly the same. That sounds great until you need twenty-five cents for the vending machine, and all you have is twenty-five pennies instead of a quarter.

 
That's not conservatism. That's misogyny.

 

I would suggest to you that to be one of those you must inately be the other to a certain degree.

 

You're perverting conservatism to fit your warped view of women. Please stop calling yourself a conservative.

Best of luck with that, dave.

 

Luck has nothing to do with it. Faith in God and acceptance of His Son Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior does.
 
 
 
 
 
Because she's a Public figure that is neck deep in politics. She chose her own path. No one forced her Bus Trip, or her book deals, or her TV show on her.

She could have finished her term in Alaska and retired nicely to a life of comfort. She didn't choose that path. She chose to be the face of the Tea Party... with that comes scrutiny. The people of ACORN are Private Citizens, but they(as a group) have been crucified by your side for half a decade(that I was aware of).

Charlie Sheen is a Private citizen... shouldn't he be allowed to continue his downward spiral of drugs, alcohol and Porn Stars? Sure... but that's not the way the world works, is it?

 

yes well, as it turns out you should have been watching weenie and tweenie.

 

WTF does that mean?

Edit... I googled it. I still don't understand the connection to Bachmann and Palin... or even the general political connection.... but thanks for playing!

 

US Army Retired adores Sarah. So I knew he would not like Bachmann declaring her candidacy. He sees it as an afront to his honey. As for Willow, don't try to understand her posts. She's really cuckoo. Never makes sense.
 
 
 
Have they mentioned the outrage of Bachmann accepting government money - for her foster children? Personally, I find that outrageous. Imagine - taking parentless children into your home and 'profiting' from it!!!! Fucking bitch!

*sacrasm off*

 

How much money did Bachmann take in from being a foster mother to 23 kids?
 
 
 
Bachmann is in one week, the dirt starts surfacing. Palin has been putting up with this for 2 1/2 years. Still nothing. Bachmann is fixing to see the wrath of the liberal MSM and she will be looked at under a electron microscope. This is why Palin is going to come out shining because she has been vetted and has been vetted a second time and still, she has come out a winner. Romney has yet to be vetted like Palin. Same goes to Pawlenty but one thing is clear. There is something about a conservative woman that causes the media to go into search and destroy mode. Bachmann will be out of this race before you know it.

 Michele Bachmann | Earmarks | Tea Party | The Daily Caller 

Bachmann may also be plagued by her involvement in a controversial pardon. In 2007, Bachmann wrote a letter requesting a presidential pardon for a convicted drug-smuggler and money-launderer named Frank Vennes. Vennes was convicted of money laundering in 1988 and pleaded no contest to a cocaine and weapons charge. Making matters worse, he and his wife donated a total of $27,600 to Bachmanns 2006 and 2008 election.

Bachmanns penchant for earmarks dates back to her days in the Minnesota state Senate. Despite her reputation as a fiscal conservative, from 2001-2006, then-state Senator Bachmann proposed more than $60 million in earmarks, including a $710,000 Bond For Centerville Local Improvements Around Highway 14″ and a $40,000,000 Bond for Lino Lakes And Columbus Township Highway Interchanges.

More In Link.

 

Yes--it's the FEMALE conservative that has the bee-gee's scared out of the left wing media. SO WHAT--she wanted money to fix a highway in her own state--who in the hell doesn't?

As for the pardon--I would sure like to hear her response to that. Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich on his way out of office who owed this country millions in taxes.
 
 
I still love the post by Rightwinger (I think) that stated that Palin was ugly and looked like a man. If that were so, I would proudly declare, here on USMB, my homosexuality.

I think they're mad because that was 23 missed opportunities to have abortions.
 
 
 
 
 
I refuted this once before. You should have paid attention.

 

Michelle Bachman - running for President. Wealthy, successful, attractive, successful businesswoman and member of Congress.

What did you accomplish this week?

 

So it's unfair for the media to investigate Michele Bachmann in the same way Barack Obama has been investigated because I'm not rich.

Good one. You're really racking up quite a first impression around here.

 

No hell, the media can "investigate" anyone they want to. By the way - is that their job? To "investigate" people so idiots (like you) can draw a conclusion? Why don't you "investigate" someone yourself. Do you need CNN to do your data search? Is your Google broke?

And what's this "first impression" crapola? My first impression of you is you are a woman-hating, Liberal sheep, Kool-Aid drinking moron.

Does that count for anything?
 
 
 
 
 
I expect the public's awareness of the issue was primarily due to Fox.

And you can't even see the larger question there.

Why didn't Obama repudiate Wright until he was called out on it? Do you think that was at all sincere? Hardly. "I'm sorry I got caught." That's all it was.

But it was good enough for you, wasn't it? Must not question The One!!

 

Since the president has yet to actually do anything that could be attributed to the alleged bad influence of the Reverend Wright,

I guess I was right then, wasnt' I?

 

  --A liberal can never pick a lane and stay in it--  

  So it looks like Obama's religious history and personal associations AREN'T fair game after all, huh?

Make up your mind.

 

  --A liberal can never pick a lane and stay in it.

Asking Candidate Obama what his favorite pizza is, is not investigating. And BTW, it was Fox that broke the news about his Communist mentor, his racist preacher, the sleazy land deal with a convicted crook and his ties to an unrepentant domestic terrorist.

CNN--MSNBC--NBC--ABC--and CBS never investigated --our current President that's for certain. They were the pep rally squad for this man --and anyone that spoke out against his policies are still considered "racist" bastards.

Hey..........USA Retard.........she's not gonna run, no matter how many times you beat off to her picture.

And............if you're poor, the bitch won't even look in your direction.

 

I'm in the oil and gas drilling business. That's why I support her. She will lift the moritorium so I can get some of my rigs back to drilling here in South Louisiana.

I think it's great that some people take in kids who wouldn't otherwise have any kind of real home. With that said, not everyone who does so has selfless motives for taking in foster kids. Personally, I would like to know more about the subject since 23 kids is a pretty high number. For example, did the kids just live with her for a short period of time, or did they live with her for years? How many foster kids lived in her home at one time? Was it five at a time, or ten at a time, or fifteen at a time?

Well judging how much food my grandkids EAT when they are at my house for a few days--plus heating rooms that I normally don't heat--using water--entertainment costs--like going to a movie--you can see why FOSTER PARENTS are paid.

And I know Foster Parents--and give them all the credit in the world. Because most of the time--they are NOT dealing with kids who have been raised well--and or are easy to work with.

So put a can in it--just the fact that you even suggested that someone would take on foster parenting--when she was already in her own business as a tax lawyer--making big bucks already--is just plain STUPID. Obviously--she did it because she cares about kids. And NO foster parent takes on more than 2 or 3 kids at a time.
 
 
 
You're perverting conservatism to fit your warped view of women. Please stop calling yourself a conservative.

 

LOL. Why don't all of you centrist, linguini-spined people who don't actually stand for anything, and are willing to compromise on everything give up the word to those of us who actually believe in Conservatism.... that is the TRADITIONAL WESTERN VALUES THAT WERE THE BASIS OF PRETTY MUCH EVERY WESTERN NATION PRIOR TO 1900.... That is before you imbeciles went and fucked it all up by giving away the damn farm to every single fucking special interest group out there.

 
Luck has nothing to do with it. Faith in God and acceptance of His Son Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior does.

 

Thanks. I needed that laugh. I learned that lesson already. I saw how much good 54 years of that faith did my father.... the most truly faithful, good, and decent person I've ever known; dead on his 54th birthday of Cancer just as he and my mom were about to start being able to live their lives for themselves instead of for everyone else. If your God doesn't have any Mercy to show a man like him, there's no sense in me wasting my time on that God, because he's sure as hell not going to have any to spare for a guy like me.

I didn't say that there was any evidence one way or another. However, 23 foster kids is a pretty high number, especially for someone who already has 5 kids. I don't know what her main motivation was. Maybe she had a financial motive. Maybe she had a religious motive. Maybe she had multiple motives. At this point, I'm kind of curious as to how much money the state paid her over time to take in 23 foster kids for however long they were living with her.

My understanding is that Bachmann quit her job to become a full time mother. I think that's a good thing, frankly.

There are Americans who live their entire lives being foster parents. Meaning they're going to have a couple for a few months--then another--then another--then another.

What don't you understand about that? And What the hell do you care how much money they made--if any--off of it. Michelle Bachmann is NOT trailer trash--and never needed income from foster parenting. GEEZ you liberals will go off on any freakin tangent--in an effort to smear a good woman.

And is that primarily the source and due for the extraordinarily high numbers of people not believing the president was born in the US?

 

Beats me. If you want to make a case for it, feel free. Be advised that just because you say so is not sufficient.

 

Ironic that you would say that right after you posted your own say so on how the news of the Wright story got out,

as if that was sufficient.

Very ironic.
 
 
 
 
 
I don't know. I don't watch irrational, angry moonbats. You tell me.

 

Aha.

So your opinion on the matter is not based on evidence.

 

Are you really picking out Keef Moonbatman as a representative of the entire liberal media?

Really?  

 

Ok, name anyone in the so=called liberal media who has been measurably more vicious towards Sarah Palin than towards Glen Beck.
 
 
 
 
 
So you finally jumped off the Palin for President bus eh?

Told you that dumb bitch would never run.

 

For Army, this must be just like getting a new months Penthouse in the mail.

The latest and greatest spank material.

 

Absolutely not. I hope Bachmann goes down. When she hired Ed Rollins last week and she let him attack Palin, that was it and was the wrong thing to do. I'm more than excited from the news just released.

PALIN DECISION ON PRESIDENCY EXPECTED NEXT WEEK!!

 The American Spectator : AmSpecBlog : Palin Decision Expected Next Week 

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is expected within a week to make a decision on whether to enter the 2012 presidential campaign, according to one Republican source.

Vendors of campaign services who hope to work for Team Palin have been told that Palin, the 2008 GOP vice-presidential candidate, will decide soon one way or another on mounting a 2012 campaign.

 

She let Rollins attack Palin because Bachmann hates strong conservative women...

...that is if you believe the lunacy being tossed about here.

Bachmann attacking Palin--no way! These gals are very good friends--and you can bet Palin is all behind Bachmann--all the way. Palin will be Bachmann's biggest supporter.
 
 
 
 
 
If you weren't so lazy, you wouldn't have to rely on the media....

 

If you'll remember, the media didn't do it's job in checking out Obama. A lot of people had questions, and the liberal media ignored them.

The hardest-hitting question the lib media asked Senator Obama was, "So, tell us, Senator -- just exactly how awesome ARE you?"  

 

So why did Obama feel compelled to make a speech repudiating Rev. Wright,

if the media never made anything of that relationship?

If nobody knew anything about it, because the media covered it up, why didn't he just let it go?

 

Um, I think one of their idols would prefer you use 'refudiated'

So, instead of wanting to do better, you choose to wallow in the filth. Good job.

EVERY Foster parent is paid for expenses. Who in their right mind would pick up children off of the street--feed them--provide housing expenses--clothing and entertainment. If they didn't get reimbursed somehow--there wouldn't be any foster parenting in this country--it wouldn't exist.

So leave these kids on the street? Is that your solution?--   No one takes care of them--no one feeds them--no one clothes them. No one loves them--no one cares for them.

And Michelle Bachmann is just an evil--money hungry hog for taking care of 26 of them.

Geez you liberals are hanging onto this one with your pinky fingernail--LOL Better get Criss Mathews all over this one before it's too late.

I'm NOT trying to make the argument that it's socialism to accept money to offset costs associated with caring for foster kids. But neither is it "purely charity" to do so when one accepts money for doing it since, by definition, charity work of any kind is unpaid work. I mean, who ever heard of someone asking for gas money to get to work at a soup kitchen or asking to be reimbursed for the cost of food when cooking meals at home for disaster victims?

EVERY Foster parent is paid for expenses. Who in their right mind would pick up children off of the street--feed them--provide housing expenses--clothing and entertainment. If they didn't get reimbursed somehow--there wouldn't be any foster parenting in this country--it wouldn't exist.

 

I don't believe that EVERY foster parent is paid for their expenses. I'm sure that they're offered money to help pay for caring for the kids. But I wouldn't be at all surprised if some people actually decline the money.
 
 
 
 
 
It's not "pure charity" if you get paid to do it.

 

Exactly! According to CON$ervatism it's Socialism, taking from the achievers to give to the needy. It's welfare, she took on children she could not afford expecting the government she hates to pick up the tab.

 

So leave these kids on the street? Is that your solution?--   No one takes care of them--no one feeds them--no one clothes them. No one loves them--no one cares for them.

And Michelle Bachmann is just an evil--money hungry hog for taking care of 26 of them.

Geez you liberals are hanging onto this one with your pinky fingernail--LOL Better get Criss Mathews all over this one before it's too late.

 

That's the CON$ervative way. The government has no business doing charity. That's what PRIVATE charities are for according to CON$. Moochele Bachmann is a Socialist, taking taxpayer money to redistribute it to others.
 
 
 
 
 
Since the president has yet to actually do anything that could be attributed to the alleged bad influence of the Reverend Wright,

I guess I was right then, wasnt' I?

 

  --A liberal can never pick a lane and stay in it--  

  So it looks like Obama's religious history and personal associations AREN'T fair game after all, huh?

Make up your mind.

 

  --A liberal can never pick a lane and stay in it.

 

When you don't have any standards, you don't have to worry about living up to them.
 
 
 
 
You're perverting conservatism to fit your warped view of women. Please stop calling yourself a conservative.

 

LOL. Why don't all of you centrist, linguini-spined people who don't actually stand for anything, and are willing to compromise on everything give up the word to those of us who actually believe in Conservatism.... that is the TRADITIONAL WESTERN VALUES THAT WERE THE BASIS OF PRETTY MUCH EVERY WESTERN NATION PRIOR TO 1900.... That is before you imbeciles went and fucked it all up by giving away the damn farm to every single fucking special interest group out there.

 

I don't know who you're screeching at, but you aren't talking about me.

You're an anachronism. Your username proclaims it. The values you espouse simply aren't practical for the modern world. Stamping your feet and having little hissy fits won't change that fact.

 
 
Luck has nothing to do with it. Faith in God and acceptance of His Son Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior does.

 

Thanks. I needed that laugh. I learned that lesson already. I saw how much good 54 years of that faith did my father.... the most truly faithful, good, and decent person I've ever known; dead on his 54th birthday of Cancer just as he and my mom were about to start being able to live their lives for themselves instead of for everyone else. If your God doesn't have any Mercy to show a man like him, there's no sense in me wasting my time on that God, because he's sure as hell not going to have any to spare for a guy like me.

 

I'm sorry for your loss. I look forward to meeting your father in Heaven. And I'll pray that you find the faith he had.

observation of the media and not an opinion of right or wrong.

I think it's great that some people take in kids who wouldn't otherwise have any kind of real home. With that said, not everyone who does so has selfless motives for taking in foster kids. Personally, I would like to know more about the subject since 23 kids is a pretty high number. For example, did the kids just live with her for a short period of time, or did they live with her for years? How many foster kids lived in her home at one time? Was it five at a time, or ten at a time, or fifteen at a time?

 

Lacking any evidence there was any motive other than pure charity, why?

 

It's not "pure charity" if you get paid to do it.

 

That's kinda interesting. Liberals believe wealth redistribution through threat of force is charity, and feel good about themselves for being generous with other people's money.

It's not charity if you give away someone else's cash.

And is that primarily the source and due for the extraordinarily high numbers of people not believing the president was born in the US?

 

Beats me. If you want to make a case for it, feel free. Be advised that just because you say so is not sufficient.

 

Ironic that you would say that right after you posted your own say so on how the news of the Wright story got out,

as if that was sufficient.

Very ironic.

 

Not at all. I gave my opinion -- I didn't state it as fact. I know the difference. I'm not a leftist.

Has Glenn Beck's children been attacked?--because Sarah Palin's has.

CNN--ABC--NBC--MSNBC and CBS has all joined in on attacking a conservative woman--and the size of this thread shows you how terrified the left is of a conservative female.

Heck--we actually have liberals on this board right now--bitching about how greedy Michelle Bachmann was for being a foster parent. They have their panties so tied up in a wad over this single issue--that they're now foaming at the mouth-and their eyes are watering-LOL That's the type of HATE that the left in this country continually demonstrates against female conservatives.

Why are you personally attacking us for supporting the principle that Michele Bachmann ought to get the same kind of scrutiny that Obama has.

In fact, if some birther-type issue were to arise around Bachmann, not necessarily about birthplace but something of the same conspiratorial nature, along with the let's say 'zeal' as exhibited by the birthers,

what would be wrong with that? It's what Obama had to endure, and importantly, it got almost no widespread outright condemnation by the Right.

Fair for one, fair for the other.

Bachmann is in one week, the dirt starts surfacing. Palin has been putting up with this for 2 1/2 years. Still nothing. Bachmann is fixing to see the wrath of the liberal MSM and she will be looked at under a electron microscope. This is why Palin is going to come out shining because she has been vetted and has been vetted a second time and still, she has come out a winner. Romney has yet to be vetted like Palin. Same goes to Pawlenty but one thing is clear. There is something about a conservative woman that causes the media to go into search and destroy mode. Bachmann will be out of this race before you know it.

 Michele Bachmann | Earmarks | Tea Party | The Daily Caller 

Bachmann may also be plagued by her involvement in a controversial pardon. In 2007, Bachmann wrote a letter requesting a presidential pardon for a convicted drug-smuggler and money-launderer named Frank Vennes. Vennes was convicted of money laundering in 1988 and pleaded no contest to a cocaine and weapons charge. Making matters worse, he and his wife donated a total of $27,600 to Bachmanns 2006 and 2008 election.

Bachmanns penchant for earmarks dates back to her days in the Minnesota state Senate. Despite her reputation as a fiscal conservative, from 2001-2006, then-state Senator Bachmann proposed more than $60 million in earmarks, including a $710,000 Bond For Centerville Local Improvements Around Highway 14″ and a $40,000,000 Bond for Lino Lakes And Columbus Township Highway Interchanges.

Plenty of thought. The Fates are simply the conduit through which the will of the Universe is brought into this world. They appear to us as women and spinners because that is the easiest way for our simplistic minds to comprehend who they are and what they do. The Maiden.... our early life. The Matron.... adulthood. The Crone.... our later years. They spin the will of the Universe for each of us into a thread which cannot be altered by any man or God... including the length of that life to the most minimal measurement of time. Not unlike an oracle of older days, except that they are eternal as a force of the Universe.

Another well-worn attack is that she took in foster girls because she was looking for reliable built-in babysitters for her kids.

For some reason, Bachmann has done little to shunt aside this criticism. When she has been asked if these foster girls babysat her biological children she says she cant recall.

I don't mind the pardon for cocaine dealing. Will she now move to legalize cocaine as to remain consistent.

I also don't mind earmarks, I would personally rather the tax dollars be apportioned by congress and be returned to the taxpayers of each congressional district. Rather that than it be apportioned by the executive branch at his discretion with no oversight.

Teenage girls need foster families, too.

What a crock... I think that unless otherwise proven... that Bachmann ought to get credit for her role as a foster parent. That is a good thing, and I... being the bleeding heart liberal that I am... applaud her sacrifice.

However, with the same breath... I criticize her assumed stance that government needs to get out of the same "Social Programs" that made it possible for her to do the things she has done.

Because, make no mistake... that is the platform of the right.
 
 
 
 
Yeah... but it's only when their candidates get legitimately scrutinized that they bitch. When the Right winger Media makes up bullshit stories about people being closet Communists, Kenyan Muslims, and all the rest of the crap that gets vomited from these scumbags... they all do a happy dance.

 

Ahh...so speculating that Trig Palin is Sarah's grandson fathered by her husband is legitimate scrutiny?

 

HUH?

Never heard that.

IT originally came from a blogger.... right Mr. Daveman? Maybe it got some legs and moved into the realm of extremely left wing media.... but it pretty much died there, and NO ONE of note mentions it anymore.

It was a bullshit supposition by a bullshit writer.

Once again... as the bible says... before you tell a neighbor about the mote in their eye... take the LOG out of yours first.

Wonkette isn't a little WordPress moonbat blog.  
 
 
Face it, Folks, the palin/bachmann lovefest from the right will continue. The amt of shit palin has been given a pass on is impressive, and the fact that bachmann was re-elected.....  
 
 
 
 
Bachmann is in one week, the dirt starts surfacing. Palin has been putting up with this for 2 1/2 years. Still nothing. Bachmann is fixing to see the wrath of the liberal MSM

 

Now, of course, all this dirt was dug up by the GOP so therefore the "Liberal" MSM is to blame!!!  
You do know that the Daily Caller is a CON$ervative website, don't you?
Oopsie!

May 16, 2011
RUSH: Let's move to this whole notion here of what's happening inside the Republican field and the fact that opposition research is now being conducted on Michele Bachmann. There is a little game -- I don't know if you've noticed this, but if you haven't noticed it, don't doubt me. Part of my job is to notice things before you do, and then tell you. It's called the cutting edge. I'm on it. I own it. There's a little game being played by the established Republican commentariate, what I call the inside-the-Beltway conservative intelligentsia, the Republican intellectual elite. It is aimed at muddling conservatism and discrediting, taking down, if you will, conservative Tea Party candidates in the Republican presidential primary process.

RUSH: Now, let's look at Bachmann, just a quick peek here at Michele Bachmann. She is a favored target of establishment Washington. Now, that doesn't come as a surprise to you, does it? I mean you know that she's a target, you've seen it. It might perplex you as to why at this stage of the game. Look, I know we are in the Republican primaries and the battle is between ourselves now. It's understandable. But in establishment Washington Bachmann is a favorite target, and even to the point of talking about she's too short or she's radical or what have you. But in this case, in the Daily Caller piece, the attack on her is that she supported earmarks and ethanol.

 

The RepubliCON$ are so STOOPID!

If they weren't such dangerous LIARS it would be laughable.

However, it's still comical.

Stoopid CON$.
 
 
 
Bachmann is in one week, the dirt starts surfacing. Palin has been putting up with this for 2 1/2 years. Still nothing. Bachmann is fixing to see the wrath of the liberal MSM and she will be looked at under a electron microscope. This is why Palin is going to come out shining because she has been vetted and has been vetted a second time and still, she has come out a winner. Romney has yet to be vetted like Palin. Same goes to Pawlenty but one thing is clear. There is something about a conservative woman that causes the media to go into search and destroy mode. Bachmann will be out of this race before you know it.

 Michele Bachmann | Earmarks | Tea Party | The Daily Caller 

Bachmann may also be plagued by her involvement in a controversial pardon. In 2007, Bachmann wrote a letter requesting a presidential pardon for a convicted drug-smuggler and money-launderer named Frank Vennes. Vennes was convicted of money laundering in 1988 and pleaded no contest to a cocaine and weapons charge. Making matters worse, he and his wife donated a total of $27,600 to Bachmanns 2006 and 2008 election.

Bachmanns penchant for earmarks dates back to her days in the Minnesota state Senate. Despite her reputation as a fiscal conservative, from 2001-2006, then-state Senator Bachmann proposed more than $60 million in earmarks, including a $710,000 Bond For Centerville Local Improvements Around Highway 14″ and a $40,000,000 Bond for Lino Lakes And Columbus Township Highway Interchanges.

More In Link.

 

About. Damn. TIME!!
 
 
 
About. Damn. TIME!!

 

And another braindead moron who will believe anything about Bachmann if it makes her look bad chimes in.
 
 
 
 
 
No, you didn't, you lying sack of dog shit.

 

Go two posts up.

Opps

Oops again.

 

Yeah, I did. A whiny leftist hit piece is hardly credible.

But you sure swallowed it whole. Dumbass.  

 

Everybody is a Liberal to CON$. The Christian Seance Monitor Is hardly leftist, and the Washington Slimes is one of the most radical Right-Wing extremist rags there is.

Oopsie yet again.  
 
 
 
 
 
  Consistency is not your strong suit, is it?

I must have missed Beck's run for public office. Do you have a link?

 

That has nothing to do with it.

I'll repeat the question:

Name anyone in the so-called liberal media who has been measurably more vicious towards Sarah Palin than towards Glen Beck.

 

That has everything to do with it, you weasel.

 

What does it have to do with it?
 
 
Daveman... did you ever hear the expression... If you live in a glass house.. don't throw stones?

That is exactly what is happening. It is time for you assholes to pay the piper for all the bullshit you have spewed these past 3 years(going on four).

In short... what comes around, goes around. You are too busy playing the victim that you don't even want to acknowledge what the right has done during the recent past.

Typical and expected.

Picking out 23 "teenage" girls is way different than "raising" 23 foster children. Even you have to admit that. Right?

 

Teenagers babysat Moochele's children and did the house keeping chores while Socialist Welfare Queen Moochele took money from hard working tax payers to the tune of $30 tax free dollars a day per live in maid and live in day care worker for a total of $1.2 million tax free dollars.

Agreed.

Here we have Michell Bachmann--good enough to kids to foster parent them--and the liberals MESSIAH--won't take care of his 1/2 brother in Kenya--who lives in a hut and makes the equivalent of $20.00 dollars a year--also with an aunt that lives in the slums somewhere in NY--and he doesn't look after her either. I guess to a liberal when it actually comes to helping others--the conservative side of the isle is doing it. Ask a liberal to do it--they sure will with your money not their's.--LOL
 
 
 
 
 
Anyone know anything about MB's 23 foster children? I heard that every single one was "picked up" as teenagers, all were girls and they worked as "live in" babysitters for her 5 "real" children. Is it true?

 

And there's the first bald-faced lie trial balloon.  

Who told you to post that, dean? You're not smart enough to have come up with it on your own.

 

Christian Science Monitor?

They have five children: Lucas, Harrison, Elisa, Caroline, and Sophia, and have also helped parent 23 foster children, all teenage girls.

 Election 101: Ten facts about Michele Bachmann and her presidential bid - What is her religious and family background? - CSMonitor.com 

Another well-worn attack is that she took in foster girls because she was looking for reliable built-in babysitters for her kids.

For some reason, Bachmann has done little to shunt aside this criticism. When she has been asked if these foster girls babysat her biological children she says she cant recall.

 Michele Bachmann plays politics with foster care 

Oops.

Give me real examples of the previous 8 years. Not typical bullshit from the right wing.. but real examples.

What I have seen is a president who CHOSE to fight a war on two fronts AND give tax breaks to those who need it least, while those who need it most are forced to pay the bill.

What I have seen is a bailout that most AMERICANS were against shoved down a Congress's throat at the exact right time to cause enough confusion and concern for their own jobs to pass... one that the sitting president readily passed into law that gave CERTAIN financial institutions bailouts while other... smaller entities passed into oblivion....causing MORE power and MORE influence to pass into the hands of the MOST Capable of handling the SELF MADE CRISIS that they themselves made.

I see staggering trade deficits that NO ONE from the right(or the left, for that matter) wants to address that cause up to 700 Billion Dollars of potential revenue to go by the wayside.

In short, you see what you want to see. Most of us deal in reality.... make no mistake... no one is innocent... but your side makes a living pandering to them.

Have they mentioned the outrage of Bachmann accepting government money - for her foster children? Personally, I find that outrageous. Imagine - taking parentless children into your home and 'profiting' from it!!!! Fucking bitch!

*sacrasm off*

 

not outrageous. but when you're a government hating loon who thinks people should "exercise their second amendment rights" when they don't agree with what the majority voted for, then perhaps you shouldn't be taking government money?

that said, it's the least of what's wrong with her.

Just because you hate that black guy so much, that "Kenyan Colonial Mau Mau communist fascist". Just "make up shit" and then say, "See, see, he's been exposed".

Once again, another post filled with lies and half truths.

And these contributions, some of which can be pieced together through tax filings of corporate foundations and other public records, also show how the chamber has increasingly relied on a relatively small collection of big corporate donors to finance much of its legislative and political agenda. The chamber makes no apologies for its policy of not identifying its donors. It has vigorously opposed legislation in Congress that would require groups like it to identify their biggest contributors when they spend money on campaign ads.

The chambers increasingly aggressive role  including record spending in the midterm elections that supports Republicans more than 90 percent of the time  has made it a target of critics, including a few local chamber affiliates who fear it has become too partisan and hard-nosed in its fund-raising.

Obama gets his money from "middle class" America. And when he does get money from "corporations", it's from the people that work there, NOT the company itself.

Is it true that ALL 23 of MB's "teenage" foster children were girls she used to babysit her "real" children?

 

I know absolutely nothing about the age or gender of MB's foster children. I assume that they're all now adults. It will be interesting to see what, if anything, they have to say about their time with the Bachmanns if they're ever approached for comment.

And these contributions, some of which can be pieced together through tax filings of corporate foundations and other public records, also show how the chamber has increasingly relied on a relatively small collection of big corporate donors to finance much of its legislative and political agenda. The chamber makes no apologies for its policy of not identifying its donors. It has vigorously opposed legislation in Congress that would require groups like it to identify their biggest contributors when they spend money on campaign ads.

The chambers increasingly aggressive role  including record spending in the midterm elections that supports Republicans more than 90 percent of the time  has made it a target of critics, including a few local chamber affiliates who fear it has become too partisan and hard-nosed in its fund-raising.

Obama gets his money from "middle class" America. And when he does get money from "corporations", it's from the people that work there, NOT the company itself.

And I "Proved it". All you can do is lie and lie again. Why can't right wingers be honest? Ever?

 

Oh, you lying sack of shit.

 Democrats Rake In Record Donations From Corporations - ABC News 

And from the "people that work there"? You really believe that? Tool.

Daveman... did you ever hear the expression... If you live in a glass house.. don't throw stones?

That is exactly what is happening. It is time for you assholes to pay the piper for all the bullshit you have spewed these past 3 years(going on four).

In short... what comes around, goes around. You are too busy playing the victim that you don't even want to acknowledge what the right has done during the recent past.

Typical and expected.

 

Please give us some examples.

In what way is reacting to false stereotypes and false accusations called "Playing the victim"????
 
 
 
 
 
I give it week before you anoint her as the "true messiah" and Obama the "False Prophet".

 

Sorry; I don't do Cult of Personality nonsense. I'll leave that to you leftists.

 

 

 

Indeed. With these people? It's symbolism over substance, everytime.

 

As I've been saying the past couple of days, for leftists, the only thing that matters is the last thing said. What was said yesterday doesn't matter. What was actually done NEVER matters.

What was said today defines reality.
 
 
 
 
 
Yeah! He should have put them to work cleaning his house and babysitting his kids and charged the government $1.2 million tax free dollars like Moochele Bachmann did and then you would praise him like you do the "Liberal" welfare queen Moochele.

 

How violently would you shit your pants if someone referred to the First Lady as Moochele?  

 

I got the name from GOP hate radio calling the First Lady "Moochelle."

Oopsie yet again!

I've been posting here long enough for you to know by now that all my "offensive" language comes from precedents set by GOP shills.

The favorite attack thrown at conservatives is that they're Bible-banging, gun toting, closed-minded reactionaries. Michele Bachman is no exception. She's crazy and stupid because she is God-fearing and decent.

We have been told by Obama himself that those people of that particular classification need to take their guns and their religion and cram it along with their hatred for people of different races and religions.

Then the creep goes out and starts telling the Israelis that then must commit mass-suicide by going back to the 1967 borders, the Brits can take their friggen bust of Winston Churchill back, and the Tea Party, or "Tea-Bagger" as he calls them, is full of hateful white bigots and possible terrorists.

And what's worse is their are pictures like this around.

One of the favorites of blacks. (You can get a framed enlarged painting of this for around $150)

It shows a man who decided that he would for one day use God to prove he's a man of the people.....even though he despises other Christians deeply because of their skin color or their simple-mindedness, or their love for God and their guns. (Along with their love for NASCAR)

No, she's crazy and stupid for using Jewish mass graves as a backdrop, and because she knows NOTHING about American history, or the Constitution.

As far as Obama? No. He didn't say that Israel has to go back to their 1967 borders. He said that talks should resume for peace and that new borders should be defined, and a good STARTING POINT for the negotiations (not how they end) should be those borders.

 BEVERLY TRAN: Calling All Bachmann Foster Kids 
Calling All Bachmann Foster Kids

Bachmanns on public welfare
If you were a foster child of Marcus and Michele Bachmann, I highly encourage you to get an attorney because you will be able to sell your story and go on the talk show circuit.

Aging out the foster care system is living hell, but, why not make a small fortune telling your story to the media?

See, the foster care system was never designed to address electronic information technology. What that means is there is no law preventing the former Bachmann foster care kids to tell all.

Feel free to contact me for the exclusive, now hop to it!

If the Bachmanns can rake in big time dollars off the public welfare entitlement programs of foster care then why can't you make big time dollars off the privatized free market called capitalism?

Let's see what the presidential candidate has to say about foster kids speaking out and getting paid to do it.

She is a non-factor.
 
 
 
She is a non-factor.

 

Well that was enlightening--   You know it's O.K. to not reply to something--if you really don't have anything to say.

She's gaining on Romney which signifies that she is still very much in this race.
 
 
 
She is a non-factor.

 

As both she and Palin should be.
 
 
The "farm subsidy" story line which the liberal propagandists are trying to foist off on the people is drivel. It's bullshit.

As for anything else, I'm ok with the vetting process.

But it really is too bad that the liberal propagandists whom we laughingly call "reporters" aren't at all interested in doing similar work on the background of liberal Democratics.
 
 
 
The Wright deal was headlines for a month.

 

They are still investigating Palin, and the election has been over for 2 1/2 years.
 
 
 
Funny that you would cite all those stories, since there's no way you could know about them, because as daveman said,

they were never covered in the media.

 

The vast majority of Democrats don't know a thing about any of them because the major DNC propaganda outlets are all they watch.
 
 
 
That's what News is supposed to do... report stories. Amazing that you guys aren't complaining about the MSM when it comes to Weiner.... he's a Progressive and he legitimately did something wrong and he's paying for it... Charlie Rangel.... much the same. Wow...imagine that.

 

The last time I checked, Charlie Rangel got reelected, so how is he "paying" for anything?

As for Anthony Wiener: when a congressmen is watching his dick around and posting the photos all over the internet, people are going to pay attention. The media can't ignore stories that are so salacious and outrageous that it would mean losing millions of viewers if they did.

 
What you want is the witch hunt that YOUR side's media pulled on the Current President to happen across the board, which is bullshit because most of those Tidbits you threw out were misinformation from the right. In short, just because you believe something to be the truth... doesn't make it the truth.

 

What you call a "witch hunt" is normal treatment for conservatives. Consider, for example, the treatment of Sarah Palin. They are still investigating her.
 
 
 
She's gaining on Romney which signifies that she is still very much in this race.

 

Being in the race and being a non-factor aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, oreo. Romney will be no more a factor than Palin or Bachman in the end. The only way for any one of those three to be any factor at all will be for the Republican Party to ignore even the most basic of Conservative ideals, at which point it won't matter because Obama will win in a landslide of Reaganesque proportions.

So we can expect, in contrast, to see in depth stories by 'reporters' from places like Foxnews, Newsmax, CNS, the Examiner, etc., etc., digging up dirt on Michele Bachmann?
 
 
The left like to act like this administration has not set the record for the amount of earmarks attached to it's leftist bills. But they will point to a GOP candidate and say earmarks are a monstrosity "Which I think are but that is besides the point". Clinton was the King of pardons also, pardoning all his leftist cronies who where caught up in his scandals and what not. As far as farm subsidies, where the fuck do you think your food comes from?

How is telling the truth about Kerry despicable? Are you claiming he was actually in Cambodia?
 
 
 
 
That was Karl Rove. How quickly they forget...or is it just myopic vision?

Here's John McCain himself regarding the rumor that he had an illegitimate child:

QUESTION: Karl Rove?

MCCAIN: Oh I, listen, he ah. Nobody denies he's one of the smartest political minds in America. I'd be glad to get his advice. I get advice from a lot of people. I'd be happy to have his advice.

QUESTION: I was wondering about that, right....
MCCAIN: He beat me. I certainly would be glad to get his advice. I don't think I'd want to revisit how he did it. And I mean that. Not about South Carolina. I mean I don't feel like reliving my defeat.

QUESTION: Are you worried about, he uses very aggressive tactics is that something that--

MCCAIN: I've always respected Karl Rove as one of the smart great political minds I think in American politics. I've always respected him. We never had any ill will after the initial South Carolina thing.

And then there is:

After Bush had been badly beaten by McCain in the New Hampshire primary and his campaign moved on to South Carolina, its back against the wall, the McCain people thought they were seeing the Mark of Rove when scurrilous material started circulatingdark suggestions that McCain had committed treason while a prisoner of war, and had fathered a child by a black prostitute. But there were no fingerprints, Bush won the primary, and that was the end of the McCain campaign.

 THE CONTROLLER 

So you wanna talk some more about how it was the "liberals" that were calling John McCain treasonous?

It also wasn't liberals that were lying about decorated war veteran John Kerry.

The long and the short of it is that you don't have a quote of Karl Rove saying McCain is a traitor. All you have is a lot of scurrilous leftwing gossip.
 
 
 
 
 
Good job, Dean. You're halfway to the "Bachmann ran a whorehouse!!" meme.  

 

Funny, I was thinking maids and housekeepers.

 

Doubt it. You don't think at all.

 

I think the Bachmanns are using those girls.

That's it. Close those eyes up tight. You claimed that it was "liberals" that started the rumors about McCain. That is a LIE. Those rumors did not start during the Obama/McCain campaign, but the Bush/McCain campaign. Truth hurts. You'll get over it.

No, I said they accused him of being a traitor. I didn't say anything about any "rumors." I have seen liberals accusing McCain of being a traitor all over the internet, including in this forum.

Teenage girls need foster families, too.

When are you going to start the incest allegations? Or are you going to go with the prostitution ring thing?

 

There is no accusation so low and despicable that these leftwing scumbags won't resort to it. They tried to accuse John McCain of being a traitor and a coward.

 

That was Karl Rove. How quickly they forget...or is it just myopic vision?

Let's not forget the swiftboating of John Kerry either.

 

John Kerry was Swiftboated by members of his unit.

In six months John Kerry put himself in for 3 Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star, and a Silver Star, and he had to go around his chain of command to get it approved.

3 Purple hearts and never spent a day in a hospital. His injury required a band-aid.

Then he turns around and uses other people's stories, which are basically rumors, about their Vietnam War experiences and testifies in front of Congress to help turn the public against the war.

I really don't feel anything for Sen. John Kerry. He made his bed. He needs to sleep in it.

There you go. Proof positive of the LIES people will believe. He served and he served honorably. What he did afterward has no bearing on his service. Same goes for McCain.

So what have you got? Oh yeah, some paranoid ravings with a single shred of substantiation. All I said is that liberals accused McCain of being a traitor, and that fact is undeniable. It doesn't matter whether the accuser chose to remain anonymous. That just makes it all the more scurrilous One thing that can't be denied is the fac that they were liberals.

 
Let me guess...you've never said anything about our current President right?

 

 

Yes, I've told the truth about him: He's a lying Marxist thug.

It was proven to you that liberals did not start the treason crap about McCain since it started during the McCain/Bush campaign.

Sorry, but you can't get your little "I hate liberals" panties in a bunch about people on a message board saying crap about McCain when you engage in the same exact kind of ludicrous rhetoric.

And......don't forget........neither knows squat about the Constitution, American History, and both have a penchant for vicious hyperbole when trying to get their bumper sticker slogans across. Palin's was "don't retreat, reload", and Bachmann's is using Jewish war dead as a backdrop.

Right, USMB lefties?

 

We're going to treat her the same way Obama has been treated. Only not as stupidly.
 
 
Being a Foster Parent is probably the biggest reason Bachmann has a chance at the GOP nomination. No matter how you cut it, taking in foster kids is tough. My wife and I did it for 13 years and had over 40 kids. The difference would be, we did it alone. I expect Michelle and her hubby have plenty of paid help.

It ain't no picnic, lemmie tell ya.

No, you didn't, you lying sack of dog shit.

 

Go two posts up.

Opps

and

Oops again.

 

Yeah, I did. A whiny leftist hit piece is hardly credible.

But you sure swallowed it whole. Dumbass.  

 

So you have proof she didnt have non teen ages females? There is something fishy going on there but I am sure with her Oral roberts degree, she is fine.

Obama's worse than anything Bachmann could do. Bachmann 2102. She is best candidate out there now for the GOP nomination. Granted I won't put all my eggs into one basket. But I am a Bachmann supporter. But I would be ok with Pawlenty and Santorum and Cain and Palin. I wouldn't be ok with Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich, John Huntsman and Mitt Romney.
 
 
Yeah, but Sea Witch.... it's OK... because McCain is a Republican... It's not OK with Kerry because he's a Democrat.

This whole thread is nothing more than astounding. And I hate to admit it, but from both sides on this.

First we have Daveman calling me out on the "Trig Palin" bullshit... which I don't even come close to believing, then we have my fellow lefties all but saying Bachmann is using Teenage girls as menial labor... which I don't believe unless proven.

My only beef is that Bachmann talks a big game about American Exceptionalism and small government, but she has no problem collecting those taxpayer dollars to Keep taking in Foster kids, but wants those types of Government handouts eliminated for every one else.

In this particular scenario, she is no better than the mythological teen mom popping out kids to increase her welfare benefits that I have heard about from Conservatives ad nauseum.

Well, that's what happens when you stand in an echo chamber and screech. Everybody else sounds just like you.
 
 
Daveman... I'm one of those "demonic" liberals.... Why aren't you coming after me?

Perhaps you realize that Political innuendo is not my game. Perhaps You recognize that I choose to make this about real issues and problems and not about scandal and suppositions.

I just wish more of you on the RIGHT would do the same thing.

The crazy thing is... you are all cool with calling our current administration all kinds of derogatory names, and spreading rumors and innuendo... but when it's your guy(or as the case may be... gal).. it's so "UNFAIR".

Why doesn't your side MAN UP and realize that Democrats... and even Progressive Democrats... are not the Marxists you think they are? No... you won't do that... because that would make us PEOPLE. People who work very hard for our livings. You'd rather think that we are all Welfare bums on a public library Computer talking about this stuff... When in fact.. most of us are just as employed, just as much of a taxpayer, just as much as an AMERICAN as you and your ilk. You'll never admit that.. because it's much easier to stereotype us as "ne'er do well's" that just want to suck off of the "Government tit".

Your insistence that you not be stereotyped would carry more weight if you weren't stereotyping conservatives.

We have legitimate complaints with what Obama and Democrats are doing. Your refusal to accept them as legitimate is neither our problem nor proof that our complaints are rumors and innuendo.

I suggest you man up yourself before you tell anyone else to.

You like apples? How 'bout them apples?
 
 
I am not stereotyping Conservatives at all. That is a complete fabrication on your part.

Let me ask the following questions to prove my point....

1. Are you against a woman's choice to end a pregnancy or not?
a) don't get me wrong. I am not against a father's rights. I feel that if the father of a child is willing to take on the sacrifice of 18+ years of responsibility, then that should be a determining factor in the abortion process.

2. Do you think that homosexuals deserve to be viewed the equal of a heterosexual married couple?(legally, if not religiously)

3. Do you think that there should be REASONABLE safety nets... provided by taxpayer dollars for people who end up on the "loser list" of our great society?

4. Do you believe that the elderly who have been working for the "job creators" their whole lives, deserve to life their last 10-20 years of life without worry in regards to basic necessities(that they have already paid for)?

5. Do you believe that Health Care is a genuine service to the general public and not just another money making scheme?

These are things that I PERSONALLY believe in. I find great fault that every aspect of our lives should be a money making proposition.

Finally, I don't refuse to accept your complaints as legitimate... I just refuse to consider them accurate. I understand your frustration... I am feeling the same frustrations. I happen to feel that those frustrations are because of Very rich and powerful people influencing Public Servants to their agenda. Not just blindly blaming our woes upon those least able to influence much of anything.
 
 
 
 
 
Bachmann's and Palin's words and actions are now a matter of public record and subject to scrutiny.

 

Why should Palin be scrutinized? She's not running for anything. She's a private citizen.

 

She's guilty of being Conservative While Female.

 

She's guilty of having mouth constantly in motion without a brain to put into gear.

I wish the fucking Dumbocraps had enough sense to run any of their lackluster field of stars against President Obama. Those schmucks cannot even find their ass with two hands in broad daylight. But any number of the Dims could actually take the nomination from President Obama.

Wow... another great retort... Tell us how you really feel... or at least... how you were told to feel about our current administration!

It is simply no wonder why you and people like you aren't taken seriously with posts like this..... Dumbocrats? Dims? Good job... great insight to our problems.... and you wonder why we call your kind "Beckians" or "Rushocrats".

Keep up the good work.... if all of you were of YOUR intelligence level... Obama would be a shoe in in 2012.

Of course you can.... From your limited perspective.
 
 
 
Wow... another great retort... Tell us how you really feel... or at least... how you were told to feel about our current administration!

It is simply no wonder why you and people like you aren't taken seriously with posts like this..... Dumbocrats? Dims? Good job... great insight to our problems.... and you wonder why we call your kind "Beckians" or "Rushocrats".

Keep up the good work.... if all of you were of YOUR intelligence level... Obama would be a shoe in in 2012.

 

 
Of course you can.... From your limited perspective.

 

These are either liberal trolls attempting to make the right look bad, or they are who they seem to be. In the case of the latter, were seeing the classic rightist tactic of flinging enough mud in the air in the hope of covering the truth, since the truth is anathema to conservative dogma.
 
 
 
I am not stereotyping Conservatives at all. That is a complete fabrication on your part.

 

Well, yeah, except for the part where it's true.

 
Let me ask the following questions to prove my point....

1. Are you against a woman's choice to end a pregnancy or not?
a) don't get me wrong. I am not against a father's rights. I feel that if the father of a child is willing to take on the sacrifice of 18+ years of responsibility, then that should be a determining factor in the abortion process.

2. Do you think that homosexuals deserve to be viewed the equal of a heterosexual married couple?(legally, if not religiously)

3. Do you think that there should be REASONABLE safety nets... provided by taxpayer dollars for people who end up on the "loser list" of our great society?

4. Do you believe that the elderly who have been working for the "job creators" their whole lives, deserve to life their last 10-20 years of life without worry in regards to basic necessities(that they have already paid for)?

5. Do you believe that Health Care is a genuine service to the general public and not just another money making scheme?

These are things that I PERSONALLY believe in. I find great fault that every aspect of our lives should be a money making proposition.

 

My answers are immaterial. Do you think the views of one conservative will sway your stereotypes?

Hint: No. Because:

 
Finally, I don't refuse to accept your complaints as legitimate... I just refuse to consider them accurate.

 

...because you've got your mind already made up.

 
I understand your frustration... I am feeling the same frustrations. I happen to feel that those frustrations are because of Very rich and powerful people influencing Public Servants to their agenda. Not just blindly blaming our woes upon those least able to influence much of anything.

 

Pssst! That last is one of those stereotype things you said you don't do.
 
 
 
 
 
Why should Palin be scrutinized? She's not running for anything. She's a private citizen.

 

She's guilty of being Conservative While Female.

 

She's guilty of having mouth constantly in motion without a brain to put into gear.  

 

Then you two have a lot in common. Are you related?

bbzzttt wrong. They might have done some dumb things as we all do. But intellectually dumb? Obama pinkie fingernail has more of an IQ than Palin and Bachmann combined...seriously...
 
 
 
 
 
As I recall, when I once asked anyone to name any conservative dumber than Palin,

Michele Bachmann was the only mention.      

So apparently Bachmann and Palin are the dumbest and next-to-the-dumbest conservative politicians in the US.

 

Well, that's what happens when you stand in an echo chamber and screech. Everybody else sounds just like you.

 

Can you name any conservative politicians dumber than Palin and Bachmann?

 

I feel no obligation to defend a charge I haven't made. You're really not very good at this, are you?

Pssst! That last is one of those stereotype things you said you don't do.

 

So....

A: You refuse to answer the questions...

and lastly... because my perspective doesn't ALIGN with yours... I am stereotyping you? Yeah... I'll just excuse the Marxist, Muslim loving, Socialistic rants of you and your kind....

No point in talking to you, because you don't really want to talk and try to make heads or tails of this bullshit.... you just want your side to win.... no matter what the cost.

Dan Quayle.

Not all conservative pollies are dumb, but all dumb pollies are conservative...

 

I have two words that prove you wrong:

Joseph Biden.

If you want to know what a leftist is doing, see what he accuses conservatives of.

Yes, you are. And the latest example follows:

 
I'll just excuse the Marxist, Muslim loving, Socialistic rants of you and your kind....

 

Now you get to find where I've called Obama a Muslim-loving Marxist.

You won't be able to. Because you're letting stereotypes do your thinking for you.

 
No point in talking to you, because you don't really want to talk and try to make heads or tails of this bullshit.... you just want your side to win.... no matter what the cost.

 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what you're doing? You don't want to accept the concerns of conservatives as legitimate, so you're not interested in finding any common ground or in trying to make heads or tails of this bullshit.

You just want your side to win.

Dan Quayle.

Not all conservative pollies are dumb, but all dumb pollies are conservative...

 

I have two words that prove you wrong:

Joseph Biden.

 

While he was never an outstanding student, he has a law degree. Last time I looked they didn't hand those out in packets of twinkies. So you can an F on that score. Nice try...

Like that means anything? Vanquish claims he's a lawyer, and he's dumb as a rock.

It's not a charge it's an opinion, an assessement of conservatism.

Since you can't name any conservative politicians dumber than Palin or Bachmann, it's fair to assume you don't think they're are any.

That is funny. One of two dumbest conservatives in politics in America is running for president and doing quite well.

Here is a list of Democrat morons that I know from personal observation to be dumber than your typical professional wrestling audience:
Barney Frank Nancy Pelosi Harry Reid Barbara Lee Maxine Waters Loretta Sanchez Eleanor Holmes Norton Debbie Wasserman Schultz Alcee L. Hastings John Conyers, Jr. John D. Dingell Anthony D. Weiner Charles B. Rangel Dennis J. Kucinich Sheila Jackson-Lee Jim McDermott Chuck Schumer Patty Murray Barbara Boxer Dick Durbin Barbara Mikulski John Kerry Al Franken

Wrong, they are just plain stupid, especially Biden. He's a walking gaff machine.

There are so many stupid Democrats I would think you would be embarrassed to make such an accusation. One that immediately comes to mind is Anthony Wiener. Post pictures of your member all over the internet is hardly a smart thing for a Congressman to do. Don't you agree? And then there are morons like Maxine Waters and Barbara Boxer. Those are two perfect examples of concentrated stupidity, if I've ever seen it.

Like your "personal observation" is relevant in any way, shape or form.

With nothing to substantiate the claim. If they were so stupid? These cretins wouldn't pay them any mind. So it seems to me that they feel threatened. Big Time.

..until one listens to some of the batshit crazy shit she's said with a strait face.

and, by strait face I mean that crazy-eyed, too wide for a smile look on her face when she's under a spotlight.

You do know, don't you, that pointing to your bigotry as proof of your stereotypes is proof of nothing -- except that you're a bigot?

Nope. Doesn't look like you do.
