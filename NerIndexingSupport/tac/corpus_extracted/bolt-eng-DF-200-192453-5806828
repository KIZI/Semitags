 
 
The Student Room white person society
 
 
every other bloody ethnic background has one so I decided to start one.

EDIT: okay, my bad, this thread is hereforth renamed "the English/British Society, as i acknowledge the original title is slightly racist and that is not the intention. I apologise. Although the original title does add schock value if nothing else.
 
 
sick guy
 
 
surely it should be english/british not white
 
 
Racisum. :h
 
 
actually there are no societies for ethnic groups. they are all for nationalities
 
 
you have issues.
 
 
make an English one or gtfo.
 
 
 

Tru fax.
 
 
Hot shower, hot shower
 
 
Okay this is ridiculous! Making a thread about British culture etc like every other ethnicity seems to have is NOT racist.
However there is a difference between 'British Society' and 'white person society'.
You don't see 'Brown people society' do you? It's either 'Indian society' or 'Pakistani Society'. Choose your wording carefully.

This  
 
 
No other ethnic groups have societies on here. Fair enough if you actually wanted to make a society for English people but you are clearly acting like a baby and trying to prove some type of point. You created it because everybody else has one? Whats the point in that? You probably wont post in here after today.
 
 
There are no white people on TSR, silly.
 
 
a white person society... what are we going discuss? the education system? pressing social issues? white person society sounds boring.
 
 
Booooo.

Should be English society.
 
 
 
 
 
 

Pretty much this
 
 
Rule Brittania!
 
 
So fellow white people shall we plot the invasion of france?
 
 
Rayciss
 
 
This is a silly thread started by someone with a chip on their shoulder. Fair enough if you wanted to create a "British society" but tbh this is a.co.uk forum so most people on here will be British anyway.

Make that society if you need to but this one is stupid.
 
 
im not white

im a very pale blue colour.
 
 
 
 

Pretty much this

 

I get the basketball and the KFC, but I don't get the melon  
 
 
Every time white people say **** like this it makes me  . "Why is there no white people society", "why is there no white history month", EVERY DAY IN WESTERN EUROPE IS WHITE HISTORY MONTH. Other ethnic backgrounds make societies because they comprise about 3% of the population max so they want to find people with similar backgrounds and interests, derkhead. If you want to find a white person to talk to, walk down the road.
 
 
I'm brown, can I join?
 
 
LOL
 
 
I haven't seen a black person society.
 
 
Really? Can you link me to the brown person society and the black person society please?

We Afro-Caribbean fellows are known to excessively enjoy our watermelons for some reason  
 
 
This made me laugh, especially the motivation to make the thread according to the OP.

I'm brown, can I join?

 

NO! white people ONLY!!!SHIFT!!111!111!!1!!1!111! !!ELEVEN.

White Pride

 

World Wide... that slogan is amazing!
 
 
what about a beige society?  
 
 
 
Booooo.

Should be English society.

 

British ( or if I was to lower my self to your ignorance - Scottish society)

Lol, makes the kid look like he's a vampire spitting out blood, complete with fangs and all  

Oh, and I'm african myself, I just didn't notice we ate lots of watermelons...but then again, I didn't know we supposedly loved fried chicken before I found out the stereotype a little while ago  
 
 
To be honest, whites are all western. And this forum is western. So the whole forum is the white society.

Yeah their all on Jeremy Kyle lol

Fair enough too, if others can have ethnic based societies it is ok for British, european, white etc.
 
 
This thread obviously isn;t exclusive to white people because I'm black. In this aspect, this thread is stupid. As well as in many other respects. Fool.
 
 
 
I agree, sorry the thread wasn't meant to be antagonistic, i changed the description

 

That's fine. I was expecting a thread like this to appear soon.
 
 
 
NO! white people ONLY!!!SHIFT!!111!111!!1!!1!111! !!ELEVEN.

 

Oh well...

TO THE BROWN PEOPLE SOCIETY...... oh nevermind

Where exactly do you live?
 
 
White people need a special society like men need a rights movement.
 
 
cue racists pouring into this thread saying it's racist  
 
 
 
It's a good idea. This thread is wayyy overdue. What shall we discuss first??  

 

Ummm...

What would the point of a British people society be in Britain?
 
 
 
HAHA ditto. I too, didn't know that we all love watermelons and KFC hahah. Quite humorous though  

 

LOL. I decided to tell my black friend about the fried chicken stereotype thinking it absolutely hilarious and she just looked at me like   'you didn't know that black people love fried chicken?'

Such a fail  
 
 
this is hilarious and in no way raicst
 
 
 
luton

 

according to luton borough council 67% of luton's population is white.  
 
 
 
Ummm...

What would the point of a British people society be in Britain?

 

Why does everything have to have a point? Why not?  
 
 
Will you allow Persians to join, or are they not white enough for this society?
 
 
 
Oh well...

TO THE BROWN PEOPLE SOCIETY...... oh nevermind

 

fine, you can stay. just pretend to support the BNP or something.
 
 
I'm assuming we are not allowed to discuss our skills at basketball in this thread..?

Which is exactly why a multicultural society will never work. You've just acknowledged they seek people of their own ethnic background. Not exactly integration is it?  
 
 
wassupppp my british home peepzzz

I'm assuming we are not allowed to discuss our skills at basketball in this thread..?

 

jumping and dancing are similarly forbidden.

Anyone in the b) section IMO
 
 
 
How am I ignorant?

 

Because I though you were stating that this should be a "white person society" and that instead it should be an "English society" because England is a county. I think that's typical English to do that and not Include the other countries which England depends on (i.e. Scotland) If there should be a society it should include all the countries in the UK and Great Britain - Not just England and that's where your ignorance arrises.
 
 
 
wassupppp my british home peepzzz

 

Racist.

I guess hip-hap and basketball are out of the question...???

I raise the first point for us to discuss

How awesome having White skin is:

 
Origin on the Equator. The control of skin color over vitamin D synthesis, says Loomis, explains the distribution of the races of man in prehistoric and early historic times. As far as anthropologists can tell, "human beings" originated in Africa near the equator. Almost certainly, they had black skins. Many anthropologists have argued that dark skin evolved as a protection against sunburn and skin cancer. On the contrary, says Loomis: dark skin came first, and light skin evolved as a protection against a deficiency of vitamin D. Black skin allows only 3% to 36% of ultraviolet rays to pass, while white skin passes 53% to 72%. As early man moved north from the equatorial region, beyond the 40th parallel (roughly, the latitude of Madrid and Naples), Loomis argues, he got into a zone where black skin filters out too much ultraviolet.

He encountered rickets. The darkest-skinned young male hunters were so crippled that they could not keep up; the darkest-skinned females died in childbirth because of pelvic deformities. Those who happened to be lighter skinned, of both sexes, survived.

Thus, by the classic Darwinian process of evolution by natural selection, the farther north man went, the more completely did the light-skinned survive and the dark-skinned die out.

Natural selection FTW!

  speaking of ignorance...

England is a country not a country. wanting to have an English society is not ignorant - England is not culturally the same as Scotland. don't ignorantly put words in someone else's mouth - wanting an English society does not correlate to denying the importance of other countries in the UK.

Just reply to all the people posting comments such as "oh..the white person society is hardly accurate is it, you don't see ""the brown person society"" ", and my answer to this is no you do not see the "brown person society", but the name of the white person society is far more fitting than most people may first realise, no you do not have to be white to be British but many 2nd 3rd or 4th generation ethnic minorities who are in fact born british, educated british, taxed british, work british, enjoy all the benefits and endure all the tribulations of being british, were you to ask them their response may well be "i'm not british, i'm bangladeshi", "i'm not british, i'm south african", and, instead of starting the british society, they join the >>>insert ethnicity<<< society, so you see the fallacy of creating the "british society" in that most ethnic minorities who are in fact british, don't class themselves as such.
 
 
I'm white and you have the right to start such a society, but I personally don't feel the need to shut myself off from parts of society based on the colour of my skin, which is why I'm also against black societies, brown societies, bue societies etc unless they serve a worthwhile utility.
