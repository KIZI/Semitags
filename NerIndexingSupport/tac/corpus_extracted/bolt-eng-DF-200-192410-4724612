Haha I used to do this at school!!! Our school uniform was white shirts and a black/dark grey suit... I used to wear a football jersey under my shirt because we used to play football at lunch break or in the afternoon, so I used to get stick from my school friends all the time, I started wearing FC Barcelona shirt when they played Man Utd in the Champions League, got major stick for that!!! Then I wore a France jersey, got even more for that!

No, I didn't take my white school shirt off when I played football. I only took it off after school hours in the park because I went to a private school so teachers were much, much stricter haha!

Saying this now the England Home Shirt is so like a Shirt... me bet's that'd be easy to pass as a Skl Shirt!
