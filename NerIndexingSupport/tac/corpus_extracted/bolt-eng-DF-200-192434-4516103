Hey people who post in the Film thread/have posted in the thread - just thought I would give a heads up to the new thread. We are now on our second iteration.  

So post, subscribe, jump for joy or exit the thread by giving a disgruntled shrug.  

Last thread was pretty awesome. Anticipation was raised for upcoming films faster than a bendy ruler on its way to boner city, only to come crashing down when the Metacrtic hit the red and the tomatoes turned Rotten. We covered previews, reviews, trailers - there were tears and tantrums. Controversial statements slating classics flew left and right - neg following in its wake. There were arguments and heated debates. Discussion derailed from TV shows to literature. There were philosophical ponderings and in-depth analysis of themes and symbols within films. There were much facepalming. Let's just hope this thread is a good sequel, and not another Electric Boogaloo.

You made me feel special for 2 seconds ffs  
 
 
Does anyone know if The Eagle is supposed to be any good?
 
 
**** yeah second thread
 
 
S-bick.
 
 
first post, daaaamnit -_-

on a completely random note, I wonder why Frodo and his ragtag fellowship just fly on the giant eagles straight to Mount doom and drop the ring in the volcano like that, cut out the Two Towers and ROTK
 
 
 
Does anyone know if The Eagle is supposed to be any good?

 

looks good tbh. It's gonna get inevitably and *is already getting negative reviews just for Channing tatum being in it and people criticising his '*non acting but he fits action and dramatic roles

+ Jamie Bell + being set in that historical period = a pretty decent film imo
 
 
Might watch Dark City...
 
 
 
 
 
On a film note, been watching some zombie films (Dawn of the Dead and Shaun of the Dead), and I must say I have my zombie apocalypse plan sorted out.
Set up a perimeter of outward facing treadmills around my hideout. Flawless. And ffs, don't split up when investigating an area. You go that way and I'll go this way. Lets just stay the **** together.
I brought up that last point concerning horror films in the last thread, but it's true. Stay together.

"The Eagles are a dangerous 'machine'. I have used them sparingly, and that is the absolute limit of their credibility or usefulness." (J. R. R. Tolkien, Letter to F. Ackerman, June 1958)

Basically, because if that happened, there would be no plot.  
 
 
 

Thread 2 begins  
 
 
can't wait for Zombieland 2... Charlie Sheen must, must make a celebrity cameo - would just be epiiic
 
 
Should plough back into the films I've downloaded. Got Don't Look Now, Repulsion and Cinema Paradiso to look forward to. Also downloaded a couple of political films earlier, Inside Job and Capitalism: A Love Story. Fun fun fun.
 
 
 
.....................................

 

On the fitness soc when a new thread is started, usually one of the members calculates and posts, how many posts each individual user has in that thread.

How about something along them lines for the Film soc (1) so we can see how many posts we got and who has the highest ?  

Just an idea, so thought I'd share it.

yeaah true, good point made by Tolkien there as well. Makes me think of the 'How it should have ended' series online.. the Lord of the rings one is quite funny

If that's it, then I'll add it to the OP.  
 
 
The Kids Are All Right was pretty.....all right  
 
 
Ape, how much time did it take to quote everyone in that post, **** me.  

Saw Lincoln Lawyer today and really enjoyed it. It had looked good from the trailers but I wasn't expecting much from Matthew McConaughey, he surprised me though.

And I'm sure this has already been discussed, but is Battle: Los Angeles worth watching? May go tomorrow.
 
 
 
Monsters Inc. 2

Is there a trailer.. or any news?

If that's it, then I'll add it to the OP.  

 

41. Poor.   Though I spend very little time on TSR these days, so that's my excuse.
 
 
 
Ape, how much time did it take to quote everyone in that post, **** me.  

Saw Lincoln Lawyer today and really enjoyed it. It had looked good from the trailers but I wasn't expecting much from Matthew McConaughey, he surprised me though.

And I'm sure this has already been discussed, but is Battle: Los Angeles worth watching? May go tomorrow.

 

You should be impressed with that amazing dedication!

And I have heard a lot of mixed things about it, people generally say that if you enjoy action films then you will like it. But apart from the action, the acting and script is meant to be dire.

+ the 'Pikachu' in your sig is amazing.  
 
 
 
first post, daaaamnit -_-

on a completely random note, I wonder why Frodo and his ragtag fellowship just fly on the giant eagles straight to Mount doom and drop the ring in the volcano like that, cut out the Two Towers and ROTK

 

Nazguls, arrows, the ring's own power which would exert itself onto the minds of the eagles (á la Boromir) - and the eagles refused to bear the ringbearer, I believe.

Also the eagles were neutral, until Gandalf came back as the White and persuaded them otherwise.

I am, it's just ridiculous!

Hmm, I figured as much. Want to Fair Game and You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger more anyway, so I'll go watch B: LA if I get time after those and before Wednesday.

It really is! My brother emailed it to me a couple of days ago and I fell in love with it.  
 
 
Awesome!

Planning on going to watch that when I get time. However it has possibly the most boring tag-line I've ever seen:

 
A lawyer conducts business from the back of his Lincoln town car while representing a high-profile client in Beverly Hills.
 

 
 
 
 
Awesome!

Oh dear.   The film is so much more than that (obviously), the way it plays out is quite clever, I think.
 
 
Oooh, new thread. You are very dedicated, quoting everyone who posted in the previous thread  

Still haven't gotten around to watching The Usual Suspects -__- Darned uni.

Found a film related t-shirt site in Empire magazine, ee, I want.
 
 
All this talk of LOTR is making me crave it. I MUST FEED MY ADDICTION

NO WAY. Hopefully they don't **** it up  .
 
 
 
All this talk of LOTR is making me crave it. I MUST FEED MY ADDICTION  

 

Waaaatch it. I watched Fellowship again yesterday.  
 
 
Currently watching The Good Shepherd (it's on iplayer), also watched The Edge of Love (also on iPlayer) today.
 
 
Oh and i'm going to the cinema on Sunday, any recommendations?
 
 
Second thread  

Spoiler:
I'll post more when I finally have something meaningful to say  
 
 
 
You made me feel special for 2 seconds ffs  

 

haha lol me too.

Really want to watch black swan but havent been able to been busy with 90210
 
 
Ah, I need a cinema buddy! last time i went to see something was The Black Swan, which I must admit was very imaginative and superbly done.

On different not: watching fellowship right now ;D
 
 
 
Waaaatch it. I watched Fellowship again yesterday.  

 

Alrighty then, tommorrow I shall get the pop corn popped, drinks chilled, and friends over for my extended addition LOTR marathon. My weekend is sorted  
 
 
Starting to think I'm the only one who didn't love Black Swan. I found it a bit boring tbh, she slowly goes crazy with no particular explanation or plot other than that. I was up watching Cannibal Women In The Avacado Jungle Of Death last night and I vastly preferred it xD I can be a film fanatic with really bad taste, right?

 
Monsters Inc. 2

CAN NOT WAIT.

 

OMG SERIOUSLY? Excitement! I really hope they do it well!
 
 
 
On a film note, been watching some zombie films (Dawn of the Dead and Shaun of the Dead), and I must say I have my zombie apocalypse plan sorted out.
Set up a perimeter of outward facing treadmills around my hideout. Flawless. And ffs, don't split up when investigating an area. You go that way and I'll go this way. Lets just stay the **** together.
I brought up that last point concerning horror films in the last thread, but it's true. Stay together.  

 

  about treadmills   I think we discussed the "splitting up the search party" in the last thread  
Watched The Adjustment Bureau recently, it was good, if a bit weird  
 
 
I truly hate Dead Poet's Society, but if you reinterpret Robin Williams' character as a trickster-devil seeking to inspire laziness and iconoclasm while tormenting a young boy with avoidant personality disorder, it becomes a lot more enjoyable.  
 
 
I liked Dead Poet's Society.

Bad Taste? I doubt it. But I see why people wouldn't like it, but that was my favourite part - not everything was explained to the bone. I am getting so fed up with blunt, straight to the point films. There are so little GOOD twists nowadays and even that one I don't think was a great one, but better than anything released recently (that I saw) I think  
 
 
 
I liked Dead Poet's Society.  

 

You like Glee. I'm not surprised.

Thanks mate. How's it going? seen anything good lately?

I literally just sat and went "awwwww" at your sig for about five minutes. That is adorable!

And I liked the Dead Poet's Society too. "O captain, my captain!"
 
 
i can't wait for limitless...DE NIRO FTW  
 
 
Planning on watching Mysterious Skin tonight, but I might not because I feel tired and it looks like an emotionally draining film.

Who's looking forward to the new Ellen Page film, Super?

mehh, haven't seen Rain Wilson in that much but it could be funny, have to wait and see
 
 
Ambivalent towards Ellen Page, but that film looks too ridiculous to not be good. And it's good to see Nathan Fillion getting work outside of that mediocre mystery series.
 
 
I like that it's got the guy who works in the pharmacy in Juno.  

"You can shake it all you like; that ain't no etch-a-sketch. This is one doodle that can't be undid."
 
 
That mediocre mystery series... lol I thought u were talking about FF for a second there. then I was like nah... 'Castle'

I'm in withdrawal at the moment. Waiting 'till summer then extended editions blu-ray here I come.  

Also downloaded the soundtrack from the films.

 
  about treadmills   I think we discussed the "splitting up the search party" in the last thread

Johnny English with Rowan Atkinson and The Pink Panther with Steve Martin are hilarious films.
 
 
I was watching The Mask this morning. I remembered why Cameron Diaz was my first crush and why I watched it constantly when younger - it's an amazing movie.
 
 
I'd like to see Charlie Sheen act again a big budget movie. Preferably a bio-pic with him playing himself

I heard (word of mouth) that they're planning a Johnny English sequel.  

Have you seen The Pink Panther 2? I thought it was rubbish; Aishwarya Rai cannot act very well.

Sounds basically like Two and a Half Men - The Movie!  

EDIT: Johnny English 2 on IMDB:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1634122/ 
 
 
 
...

 

I could rep you this time   and   for a second thread  

on a different note, I saw Black Swan yesterday!   It was amazing! Spoiler:
and I had a great discussion about the symbolism reflecting the black swan and the white swan throughout the movie. Plus we had a few thoughts on what psychological disorder she might have, if it is some kind of selfharm or if it was some kind of OCD, if she was paranoid or had a multiple personality disorder... so do we know what she had? what do you people think, did she die in the end?

I know you might already have had this discussion, but it only premiered here in Sweden last week on the 11th

Spoiler:
I would lean closer to OCD than self harm, primarily because she seems almost unconsciously to harm herself (though this isn't usually an explicit symptom of OCD). I suppose it may be the desire for self-harm on an unconscious (or sub-conscious) level, possibly because of how hard she seems to push herself (a couple of elements of a type-A personality, though she isn't at all aggressive or extroverted). I think it's an important indicator of how co-morbid most disorders are: it isn't a textbook depiction of any disorder (that I know of). And I do think that she dies in the end, although I'm not sure that's of much significance.

oops thanks for reminding me to spoiler, didn't think about it  

Spoiler:
yeah that's what I thought too, but it didn't seem like she had received any medical treatment or a therapist for that matter since her mother was always there to check up on her and acted as her "therapist" I suppose..
but maybe the aggressiveness was the fact that she was harming herself, plus she did hurt her mother when shutting the door and then when she wanted to leave she crushed her hand again..
Yes that's true, I don't know of any myself so yeah, even the display of the disorder is different.
I think it was important for her in the sense that she was striving for perfection, if she would have continued to live and performing the black swan she probably wouldn't have been able to do it exactly as the previous time when she "became" the black swan. She would've always thought that that was it, nothing could get better than that. So I think she either died or was perhaps institutionalized

I heard (word of mouth) that they're planning a Johnny English sequel.  

Have you seen The Pink Panther 2? I thought it was rubbish; Aishwarya Rai cannot act very well.

EDIT: Johnny English 2 on IMDB:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1634122/ 

 

I hope the sequel is good. On the Pink Panther note, I was about to give it a watch. Is it really that bad? That's disheartening.

Rope is probably my favourite Hitchcock film. Films set in one place appeal to me, as do films starring James Stewart. It's perfect for me!

I went to see Submarine today. It was great, although I could definitely see too many of my own traits in Oliver. I've been listening to the soundtrack all week, and it fitted the film wonderfully. It's worth going to see.

Oooh new thread. Erm, watched Knight and Day a few days ago, it was alright, wasn't expecting much tbh. One of my friends I was watching it with told me Cameron Diaz had plastic surgery on her nose and as a result I couldn't stop staring throughout the whole film at her nose as I thought it looked weird  
 
 
If I have the strength after The Football League show, I might attempt to watch Dead Man Walking.

It's up there for me. I'm a bit late, but I am really getting into his work.

James Stewart was a great actor. I do wonder if he ever played a bad guy though. If so, it was probably creepy, hilarious, or some combination thereof.  
 
 
Just watched Battle Los Angeles. It was pretty good. What I couldn't help feeling, throughout the film, was "This would make a great video game." It feels like a cross between Crysis and Modern Warfare. I mean, there's even a bit where they have to hold a position against enemy forces for three minutes.
 
 
I'm thinking of watching Sweet Sixteen in a bit; has anybody seen it?

My alternatives are Capote and Wall Street.
 
 
Capote is good but it is a biopic of the man with the most annoying voice in the history of forever, so be prepared for that. Haven't seen Wall Street.

I ended up watching Wall Street, but I'll probably watch Sweet Sixteen sometime this week, thanks. And I almost never watch an English language movie with the subtitles on, kind of a habit. I made it through The Wind that Shakes the Barley okay.  

On Wall Street, I thought it was interesting, but not enthralling. Charlie Sheen was quite good, Martin Sheen was better. Michael Douglas was really good, but not a huge amount better than what I remember of his other performances ( The Game, Traffic ). Daryl Hannah wasn't very good, but I didn't think she was as downright terrible as some people say. So yeah, not bad, not extraordinary.

Agreed. Movies like that make me wonder: 'whatever happened to Tom Cruise?' In the same way daft people say things like 'whatever happened to Edward Norton?'
 
 
Speaking of Norton, has anyone seen Leaves of Grass? It's really rather good.
 
 
Edward Norton is oddly reminiscent of Christian Bale. He's a great actor coming from films like Fight Club and American History X, but been reading up on directors having trouble working with him - was that the reason he got taken off Avengers? I don't know much about it.

Still think he could star in another good film, but he has been off the radar recently.

Agreed. What a couple of people have said to me is ridiculous, however: that he got Oscar nominations for two of his early roles ( Primal Fear and American History X ) and hasn't since, so he's potential that failed.   By that logic, people like Gary Oldman and John Cazale are pretty much useless actors.

Already seen.   Absolutely love it.

I hope they've managed to write it well enough so that the loss of the characters Elizabeth/Will don't impact the dynamic that much. Plus they've lost Gore Verbinski...

I really hope it doesn't just flop. There's a 5th/6th film on the cards (would be filmed back to back) and I'd really like them come to fruition.

Rob Marshall is a much better director than Verbinski. It's a bit of an odd choice of movie for him, but the one certain thing is that it will look sublime.

Completely unrelated; I finished reading The Gunslinger earlier (it's the first fiction book I've read in years that hasn't been by either Terry Pratchett or Chuck Palahniuk) and it was incredible. It's stuff like that which makes me wish I was a director, I know exactly how I'd film it. Instead we'll get Ron Howard dumbing it down and stripping it of it's meaning. Yipee.

Valkyrie was a step in the right direction, but now it is a return to form with Mission Impossible (which I'm looking forward to admittedly) and a slight deviation with some upcoming musical.

The two films which would have set him on the right track, role in the Timecrimes remake (not so keen on the remake itself) and At the Mountains of Madness, have dissipated into nothingness.

Glad Avatar lost, I just don't see it as a proper science fiction film, regardless of what anyone says. Predator v Donnie Darko boils down to action sci-fi vs intelligent sci-fi. I'd go with the latter.  

I'll be glad if a Philip K Dick adaptation wins.  

 
Reading some of those match-ups is just making me wince. The Matrix vs Brazil? Wall-E vs Gattaca?

However, Serenity vs Spider-Man is justice at work.

 

Glad Serenity won. Why is Spider-Man in there anyway? Because it contains science fiction elements like radioactive spiders or heroes/villains who have origins stemming from some science?

Should have differentiated between the films that are purely science fiction and ones which have science fiction elements but are more rooted in another genre (hence could have held its own competition) like superhero or dystopian films.

And if you can manage that, next time try it with Reservoir Dogs. (:

 

Challenge accepted.
 
 
 
Tbh I know pretty much nothing about directors as a whole (I only know maybe 3, 4)

 

Who would you say you know, out of curiosity? I've been asking this question a lot lately to people in real life, because I'm never sure how much of my level of interest would translate over to a general filmgoer.

 
but I'm more concerned with Marshall changing the 'feel' of the film? I don't know. I have no idea what generally happens when a new director takes over a franchise.
 

It depends very much on the director. If it's someone like Aronofsky (who was going to direct the new Wolverine film before he walked) then it's very much going to be a case of moulding it to suit him. If it's a brand new director (such as David Fincher was when he made Alien 3) then the studio tends to control it how they want.

In this case, not too much will change in terms of emphasis. Marshall isn't a particularly strong director, so he's not going to start trying to send things in a radical direction or anything like that. But if you look at his previous films (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha, Nine) as well as his background in choreography, it's clear that he cares a lot about the appearance of his work. Disney never give a lot of creative control over lightly so you don't need to worry too much about it changing, but the sets and costumes will really pop.

Of course, the issue then is that without strong direction the series is going to descend into even more of a vehicle for Johnny Depp with an increasingly incidental story, as the films have always suffered because nobody dares to reign him in.

A few, although mostly from film adaptations of novels rather than the books themselves.

 
And how would you film it?
 

It would be the most expensive arthouse film ever made.   I'd channel a ton of influences, including notably There Will Be Blood and The Way Back.

Spoilered as I wouldn't want to inadvertently ruin the story for anyone:

Spoiler:
The opening would be as in TWBB, about 15 minutes of silence until the gunslinger meets the farmer. I think it would be important to show routine and not skimp early on with setting the atmosphere (which I can almost guarantee Howard will not spend any time on).

I also think it would be very important not to have any kind of narrator. The plot shouldn't progress or be explained any faster than it does in the book. The downside of no narration would mean that the actor playing the gunslinger would have to be bloody good in order to convey all of the emotions and thoughts that are written but never said.

The flashbacks would be done at the same time as they're introduced in the books, which is generally when someone tells them in conversation. To start them I'd have the character begin a sentence, zoom into his eye to the old scene, and then gradually have the monologue fade out. I'd detail them depending on who was narrating - the Gunslinger would be detailed but without much visual creativity, the boy's would appear much more whimsical and those featuring the MiB would be hurried and blurred.

I'd use an auditory cue as a symbol whenever the gunslinger's soul is being blackened and eroded. Ideally something original but when I was reading I was thinking of the instrumental version of Mad World, which could work particularly well during scenes like the shoot-out in Tull or the end when the boy is left.

In terms of how I'd separate the movie then I'd probably divide the scenes 50% desert (including waystation), 5% forest (I'd only show the prophecy scenes and move on), 10% mountains, 10% cave, 15% golgotha.

Deserts would be shot very similar to how they are in the Way Back, the cave scenes would be illuminated similar to Buried i.e. just with proper light sources, which would make them look very eerie (and also be the reason why I'd cut quite a lot of the scenes out, as it wouldn't work for an extended time). From when the boy drops as he leaves the cave to when the MiB turns to bone I would shoot it in black and white, to really bring across the feeling of a shattered soul before moving on.

In terms of cast:

Gunslinger - I was originally thinking Daniel Craig, but Javier Bardem is an absolutely fantastic choice so hat's off to Howard for that
Boy - difficult one, as there aren't that many good child actors. Probably someone like Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada, although he's probably too old for it now so you'd have to find some new talent.
MiB - Johnny Depp (or Daniel Day-Lewis)
Woman from Tull - Helena Bonham Carter, she's pretty much made for that role.
Priestess from Tull - Dawn French

I have other ideas as well, but I think I've rambled enough...

I think I'm the only person in the world that things PoTC 3 was the best one of the trilogy... (well, what used-to-be-a-triology)

 

Yes. Dead man's chest was the best hands down, 3 was just a tad convoluted and the plot felt a bit all over the place, but I do think it was the 'grandest', had the best visuals and felt like more of an epic adventure film

^ On a slightly related note (just cos I'm linking Joseph GL to Zooey in my head)

I'd like to see Zooey Deschanel in another quirky free-spirited but fun to watch indie film, she's criticised for being typecast and all, doing the same roles (which is kinda true) but I just really like watching her on screen

And if she wants to do another sci-fi thriller, she should avoid M night Shyamalan movies and proof read the script

I cannot express how much I adore Maggie Smith. I genuinely think she's the greatest actress of all time.

Life's been a bit quiet on the film front lately...stupid uni sucking my life away!  

Watched The Weather Man this morning as procrastination though. I usually find Nicholas Cage annoying for some reason, but quite enjoyed the film though. Makes you think about grown up life and all that, especially as I'm about to leave the uni bubble myself.

Managed to finally see the Social Network as well, and really enjoyed it. In fact it was so good that it didn't even feel like two hours long, doesn't happen often. Speaking of Jesse Eisenberg (kind of), anyone seen Adventureland? Worth a watch?

It would be the most expensive arthouse film ever made.   I'd channel a ton of influences, including notably There Will Be Blood and The Way Back.

Spoilered as I wouldn't want to inadvertently ruin the story for anyone:

Spoiler:
The opening would be as in TWBB, about 15 minutes of silence until the gunslinger meets the farmer. I think it would be important to show routine and not skimp early on with setting the atmosphere (which I can almost guarantee Howard will not spend any time on).

I also think it would be very important not to have any kind of narrator. The plot shouldn't progress or be explained any faster than it does in the book. The downside of no narration would mean that the actor playing the gunslinger would have to be bloody good in order to convey all of the emotions and thoughts that are written but never said.

The flashbacks would be done at the same time as they're introduced in the books, which is generally when someone tells them in conversation. To start them I'd have the character begin a sentence, zoom into his eye to the old scene, and then gradually have the monologue fade out. I'd detail them depending on who was narrating - the Gunslinger would be detailed but without much visual creativity, the boy's would appear much more whimsical and those featuring the MiB would be hurried and blurred.

I'd use an auditory cue as a symbol whenever the gunslinger's soul is being blackened and eroded. Ideally something original but when I was reading I was thinking of the instrumental version of Mad World, which could work particularly well during scenes like the shoot-out in Tull or the end when the boy is left.

In terms of how I'd separate the movie then I'd probably divide the scenes 50% desert (including waystation), 5% forest (I'd only show the prophecy scenes and move on), 10% mountains, 10% cave, 15% golgotha.

Deserts would be shot very similar to how they are in the Way Back, the cave scenes would be illuminated similar to Buried i.e. just with proper light sources, which would make them look very eerie (and also be the reason why I'd cut quite a lot of the scenes out, as it wouldn't work for an extended time). From when the boy drops as he leaves the cave to when the MiB turns to bone I would shoot it in black and white, to really bring across the feeling of a shattered soul before moving on.

In terms of cast:

Gunslinger - I was originally thinking Daniel Craig, but Javier Bardem is an absolutely fantastic choice so hat's off to Howard for that
Boy - difficult one, as there aren't that many good child actors. Probably someone like Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada, although he's probably too old for it now so you'd have to find some new talent.
MiB - Johnny Depp (or Daniel Day-Lewis)
Woman from Tull - Helena Bonham Carter, she's pretty much made for that role.
Priestess from Tull - Dawn French

I have other ideas as well, but I think I've rambled enough...  

 

You've given this a lot of thought, Phalanges.  

Spoiler:
But I think your approach and technique may change once you've read the later novels, as it does somewhat feed back.

Are you sure about considering Daniel Craig? I mean, he's a great actor but you have to have that naturally rough and weathered look, you could also opt for Christian Bale. Daniel Day-Lewis and Viggo are far, far more superior choices than Daniel Craig considering the character of Roland, and considering roles they've played respectively.

Helena Bonham Carter would actually be much, much more suited to another role. Someone you haven't came across yet.  

I like your take on the book. Straying away from your medicine course/career very slowly but surely.  

What do you think of the format with films and TV series filling in the gaps? All in all, I don't think the real deal will turn out well at all. There are so many awful parts in the later books that should just be omitted and skipped altogether.

Howard needs to realise he shouldn't opt for a direct adaptation of the films, but a different take or version. A direct adaptation will fail, undoubtedly or just not translate well into the screen - no matter how well he tries to do it. And how they're going to approach the material itself is beyond me, there is so much insane stuff that goes on in the books - some of it is beyond the talent of someone like Ron Howard to translate to screen successfully, in my opinion.

Curious to hear your (future) thoughts on the ending of the series but you have a long way to go, just like Roland.   Man, I want to say something that I think is a good idea for the films but can't.    

As long as they don't cast Shia Laboeuf  
 
 
I just watched Incendiary. Has anyone else seen it? I thought it was a bit rubbish. Interesting to make a film on the topic of terrorism, but to make it ridiculously unrealistic and a little confusing at times was a mistake.

Michelle Williams' London accent was really impressive, though!
 
 
Oh yeah, I saw You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger last night. Really liked it, only negative was Naomi Watts who I thought was terrible. But definitely a winner from Woody Allen this time, he's been so hit and miss for the past ten years.
 
 
Tempted to watch Inception and then Monsters Inc.

Or I could do some Jurisprudence reading...

Nah.

He's been hit and miss since Hannah and Her Sisters, tbh, and arguably earlier. His only good films of the last decade were probably Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Still, it's good to hear he's back on track, if the film is indeed as good as you claim.

Figuratively anyway, like the way I felt just seconds after getting out of my seat at the cinema when inception finished, just like..... woah

haha, sounds nice - btw The Rock and Sarah Michelle Gellar are in Southland tales if you haven't seen it.. tis quite funny too.

Brief Synopsis: Southland Tales is an ensemble piece set in the futuristic landscape of Los Angeles on July 4, 2008, as it stands on the brink of social, economic and environmental disaster. Boxer Santaros is an action star who's stricken with amnesia. His life intertwines with Krysta Now, an adult film star developing her own reality television project, and Ronald Taverner, a Hermosa Beach police officer who holds the key to a vast conspiracy

Massively going back through the thread seeing as i was absent up until today.

 
Just watched Battle Los Angeles. It was pretty good. What I couldn't help feeling, throughout the film, was "This would make a great video game." It feels like a cross between Crysis and Modern Warfare. I mean, there's even a bit where they have to hold a position against enemy forces for three minutes.

 

 It might've done had they bothered to put any effort in.

Not bad

.

 

 
Yes. Dead man's chest was the best hands down, 3 was just a tad convoluted and the plot felt a bit all over the place, but I do think it was the 'grandest', had the best visuals and felt like more of an epic adventure film

 

 
I think I'm the only person in the world that things PoTC 3 was the best one of the trilogy... (well, what used-to-be-a-triology)

 

I think the only POTC film i've really liked is Curse of the Black Pearl. Whenever i've watched the other two i just end up drifting in and out of paying attention.
 
 
Damn, I wanted 10th in the posting league, my football team are 10th in league two!
 
 
Limitless is the kind of film that is enjoyable but leaves you feeling cheated. It aspires to depth but wants to keep all of it's crowd-pleasing and happiness too. And it leaves gaping plot holes and just forgets crucial elements of the story (a hint; if you're making a film about addiction and introduce a powerful side effect don't forget about it after 5 minutes). Overall there's worse ways to spend a monday night but there's far more memorable ways. There was one scene that I really liked but a lot of the other editing appeared to be done on a shoestring - the neuron graphics looked outdated compared to the opening of Fight Club, which is at least a decade older.

Might write a more in-depth review of it later. If only because I want to vent about de Niro.
 
 
Balls.
 
 
Arnold Schwarzenegger may be in a tv show... hahahaha. I'm bored

Don't think for one second that an actor of his stature would have any trouble getting decent roles if he wanted. He's probably the biggest sell-out in cinema, and I'm beginning to seriously wonder how much talent he's actually got left.

He was completely anonymous in this role. The film could have been made so much better and believable by someone like Michael Gambon playing it.

I dunno, are there really any good, serious roles being written for a man his age any more, especially ones which would get funding?

It's not a case of there being good serious roles (which there are), but at least picking roles which aren't degrading or acting well in bad films. Look at Anthony Hopkins - he is routinely in bad films, and he's consistently the best thing about them.

Actors around his age like Nicholson, Gambon, McKellen, Kingsely, O'Toole, even Hoffman are still producing good work. It's a complete non-argument to pretend he's doing the best with what he's got, and insulting to give him a free ride the way the industry is.

"I hate the awards part of the moviemaking process," he continued. "And besides, on Social Network, I didn't really agree with the critics' praise. It interested me that Social Network was about friendships that dissolved through this thing that promised friendships, but I didn't think we were ripping the lid off anything. The movie is true to a time and a kind of person, but I was never trying to turn a mirror on a generation." [...]

"Let's hope we strove to get at something interesting, but Social Network is not earth-shattering. Zodiac was about murders that changed America. After the Zodiac killings in California, the Summer of Love was over. Suddenly, there was no more weed or pussy. People were hog-tied and died. No one died during the creation of Facebook. By my estimation, the person who made out the worst in the creation of Facebook still made more than 30 million dollars. And no one was killed."

Fincher himself, generally agree with him on TSN

Finchers' wikipedia page is an interesting read... got some possibly good projects coming up

Meryl Streep, and then I get a bit confused. So many names persistently doing their best to crowd out the others.

It's sad, really. I mentioned this in the first thread as well, how I don't really know many good actresses (though it's better than before). It makes me feel sexist.

I don't think it's sexism. When you think 'greatest female actress evar', it's generally either Streep or someone from the Golden Age; Hepburn, Hepburn, Bergman, Kelly, etc. Could be to do with the popularization of method acting; for some reason, there don't seem to be nearly as many famous lady method actors as there are famous dude method actors.
 
 
It's funny that you say that, because I'm the complete opposite. I'm all about the great female actresses and know very little past the obvious about the male actors.
 
 
 
You've given this a lot of thought, Phalanges.  

 

Not really, something I've found myself doing lately is picturing what I'm reading cinematically. It happened ever since I read Survivor, which is probably the most filmable book I've ever read.

 
Spoiler:
But I think your approach and technique may change once you've read the later novels, as it does somewhat feed back.

Are you sure about considering Daniel Craig? I mean, he's a great actor but you have to have that naturally rough and weathered look, you could also opt for Christian Bale. Daniel Day-Lewis and Viggo are far, far more superior choices than Daniel Craig considering the character of Roland, and considering roles they've played respectively.

Helena Bonham Carter would actually be much, much more suited to another role. Someone you haven't came across yet.  

 

Spoiler:
The reason I suggested Daniel Craig is that in my mind the character of The Gunslinger is someone who was once a noble but has slipped on harder times. Rough Craig up a bit and you have that. Viggo would be a no from me for that reason, as I can never really picture him as having played anything other than an outcast/survivor. It would be important to me that some polish would shine through now and then. DDL is too evil to play him, I'd rather have him as the MiB. Bale would be a possibility, but then he wouldn't offer too much different from Craig and would be harder to work with (and command a bigger salary).

 
I like your take on the book. Straying away from your medicine course/career very slowly but surely.  

What do you think of the format with films and TV series filling in the gaps? All in all, I don't think the real deal will turn out well at all. There are so many awful parts in the later books that should just be omitted and skipped altogether.

Howard needs to realise he shouldn't opt for a direct adaptation of the films, but a different take or version. A direct adaptation will fail, undoubtedly or just not translate well into the screen - no matter how well he tries to do it. And how they're going to approach the material itself is beyond me, there is so much insane stuff that goes on in the books - some of it is beyond the talent of someone like Ron Howard to translate to screen successfully, in my opinion.

Curious to hear your (future) thoughts on the ending of the series but you have a long way to go, just like Roland.   Man, I want to say something that I think is a good idea for the films but can't.    

As long as they don't cast Shia Laboeuf  
 

Yeah, you have to bear in mind that I've only read one book so my thoughts are very much a work in progress. I've got to wait for the library to order in Drawing of the Three now.   Also I read the original edition rather than the revised one, so my uncompromising approach is a reflection of the inaccessibility of the original work, which I gather has since been made more readable.

I don't really think I'm qualified to comment on the TV/film concept, because I gather that they are going to be making it on multiple book rather than one film/TV series per book, which I have no idea how it will work because I have no idea how tonally similar or narratively cohesive they are.

I don't think there would need to be too much of a reimagining of the novel, aside from the things that must happen in all translations in the cutting of unimportant scenes and the visual stylings. But at least in the first book the story is a pretty solid structure, so there doesn't need to be too much messed around with it. I would question whether Ron Howard is the right man for it for completely the opposite reason to you - he's pretty notorious at dumbing down stories he adapts, and I don't want to see a film which explains the premise to you without retaining any of the mystery of the original.

I don't think I'll be leaving medicine any time soon to go off and direct though, I'm happy to think I know best without ever finding out if I could actually do it.  
 
 
 
Meryl Streep, and then I get a bit confused. So many names persistently doing their best to crowd out the others.

It's sad, really. I mentioned this in the first thread as well, how I don't really know many good actresses (though it's better than before). It makes me feel sexist.  

EDIT: On another note, I'm sitting down to watch The Butterfly Effect now.  

 

I think the industry is just inherently sexist, tbh. There simply aren't as many good female roles written as male, and the career of an actress is so much shorter than that of an actor.

Only one female-directed film has ever won an Oscar for best picture, and the only female-focused film I can remember winning the main award was Chicago. Compare that to the amount of male-dominated films winning and doing well.

Been looking forward to this since I first heard about it at Sundance.

Have you heard of the Bechdel test? It was started just to show how male-dominated the film industry is. To pass the test, the film must have at least 2 named female characters who talk to each other about something other than a man.

Nicholas Cage should really be in said film
 
 
Just watched A Single Man. I must say I wasn't that impressed with the storyline and characters, and it was a bit over-stylised for my liking. Colin Firth was really good though, and actually Nicholas Hoult was better than I was expecting... Overall I didn't mind the film, there was just something a bit off.

What are people's opinions on it?
 
 
The dialogue in Tarantino films is just...
 
 
anyone seen valhalla rising? just watched it.

like....wtf......
 
 
Just got four free tickets for suckerpunch on 31st March from IGN screenings. Looking forward to this. Only a day before but free so meh. It's one of them group ones. May have 1 or 2 spots for free for anyone who is close to Sherperds Bush. Depends on if any of my mates can't go.

Finally watched Amelie, it's brilliant. First french movie I actually watched. Downloaded Le diner de Cons now. I hope Dinner for Schmuks didn't use most of it.

Yeah I have, although I think you're being a little disingenuous in it's origins.   It was originally a joke in a comic to enable a character to get out of going to the cinema.

I think it's an interesting experiment (although appearances can be deceptive; for example Kill Bill doesn't pass the test) but it's ongoing presence can compound the problem rather than alleviate it. It would be easy to pass if you shoehorn in a scene between two characters, and yet this doesn't attack the root of the problem of integral female characters.
 
 
 
Definitely Inception and Monsters Inc!  

That reminds me, I said I'd write a review of Inception, didn't I? Oops.

 

You still have five days to do it!
 
 
TV ads' for Sucker Punch look so good   Zack Snyder really knows how to get his films great advertising and promotion.

*Refer to the theatrical trailer for 300 for refrence
 
 
RIP Elizabeth Taylor
 
 
RIP Elizabeth Taylor.  
 
 
Accidentally deleted a post I'd written with regards to the earlier issue of actresses.   It was largely a concurrence with Phalanges, so it doesn't hugely matter.

Anyway, I'm sitting down to watch Blow now. I've heard good things about Johnny Depp in it.
 
 
Elizabeth Taylor: One of the most beautiful women to have graced cinema. R.I.P.  
 
 
 
You still have five days to do it!

 

Well, I only have two really, I'm going to Helsinki on Saturday and leaving my computer behind! Hmm!

It depends how much I'm willing to procrastinate during the next two days, hehe... A lot, probably!  
 
 
Oh darn. Still need to do that Inception review.

May add it to my blog too. hehehehe *people that add multiple 'hehes', it comes across oddly on the internet *shrugs*
 
 
Also, I haven't seen The Shining or The original Texas Chainsaw massacre.... quite want to see both. Make of that what you will

The Shining is one of very few movies which actually does scare me! Halloween is one of the others. Not a very good film but it's damn scary (for me at least)...

I find more 'believable' horror films scary, such as ones with serial killers and stuff, and the ones with monsters and things not scary at all...

Hmm fair enough and the original Nightmare on elm street I'd imagine (just cos it fits with those classic slasher movies)

I'm generally the same recently, most horror films made nowadays just never scare me, Paranormal Activity I'm looking at you, it was like Jumpy and shocking at moments but really scary

then again not all modern horror / slasher films are bad, I thought the Friday the 13th 2009 remake wasn't that bad, also The Strangers is really good imo - can't wait for the sequel

I haven't seen any of those   I'm really rubbish with horror films, I haven't seen many at all, they just don't really appeal to me... I have a few friends who love almost all crappy modern horror films, and I have no idea why. So many of them are really similar and 'scare' you in exactly the same way. Don't even get me started on the Saw series

Haha fair enough, I can recommend ya some good ones if you're interested - the strangers and friday the 13th included  

Lol yeah don't we all, some are ok just for a good laugh though, cos they're more unintentional comedy than horror like Drag me to hell (omg, it's so laughably bad but it was made bad on purpose I hear)... Mirrors, When a stranger Calls (remake of a Japanese film about getting a voicemail message... then you die, seriously xD)

The Nightmare on elm Street remake that was out last year, I was laughing out loud with my friend at the back cos it was so bad and so were other people so yeah you should go see some recent ones just for the Luls

Please do recommend me some good ones, just in case I ever feel in the mood to be scared   There are loads of horror classics I haven't seen as well, hmm. Perhaps I'll try to get into horror films, we'll see.

About to watch True Grit now, exciting!
 
 
I am currently reading Sleazoid Express. A book all about NYC's grindhouse cinema. I need to rinse my eyes.

that is all.

P.S. PIRATES 4!!!! yeah.

P.P.S. Norweigian Wood made me want to commit suicide.

it was a "i haven't read the book and just broken up with boyfriend 3 days ago" suicide.
oh god. the Radiohead sountrack didn't help. I thought it was going to be this beautiful, emotionally mysterious but ultimately positive arty japanese film. Little did i know there were about 4 lines of dialogue and the world's most awkward sex scene this side of Watchmen.
 
 
It doesn't look half bad:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JerVrbLldXw 
 
 
Hm. Don't really like Captain America as a superhero, but that doesn't look horrible. And I expect Hugo Weaving to do some glorious hamming, so it'll probably be worth it for that.
 
 
Looks alreeet, Chris Evans is a great actor and will make a good Human Torch/Captain America, or as I've called him before 'HumanTorchAmerica'

Thor will probably be the comic book film of the year though imo
 
 
Coming round to the idea of these films referencing each other, and ultimately leading onto The Avengers.

Over the Green Lantern?
 
 
Feel like watching something today  
 
 
I dunno, X-Men: First Class looks promising. Matthew Vaughn is a pretty good director, and anything that explores the relationship between Magneto and Xavier (one of the most interesting in comics, imo) is aces in my book.

Yet to be seen, I still doubt the Avengers is making a wise move by being released next summer (I think it's too soon but meh)

but yeah, yet to be seen. I like the Green Lantern trailer, looks great but Thor has blown me away - it just looks hands down like it will be more entertaining and possibly more faithful to the comic

I remember when TGL trailer came out, loads of people were slating it, saying it looked crappy, cliché etc meh

I've glazed over X-men First class too.... looks pretty good

Knew something was missing. So wrapped in thinking about Avengers films that I forgot about X-Men: First Class. In that case, I too think X-Men will be the biggest or the comic book film of the year. Looking forward to that.

This. Green Lantern is going to flop massively and the Avengers films will be met with the apathy that greeted Iron Man 2. X Men looks incredible comparatively.

Hmmm wouldn't be so sure, I don't think it will be a commercial flop, it will be a flop in the eyes of most comic book fans I imagine but Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively should be sure to pull in big enough audiences

Depends on peoples' appetite for comic book films this year, it will be the 4th out after The Green Hornet and Thor, X-men First class so yeah

The Avengers films needs better direction and time on production, they've apparently already started filming it... and they switched the actor playing Bruce Banner / The hulk again, stupid

*Scratch that, TGL will be the 5th comic book film out if Captain america's out July 4th... lol

When I said flop massively I meant critically and in terms of general opinion rather than commercially, which isn't easy to predict, often carries less weight and is far less interesting (in my mind, anyway).

Probably X-Men, I don't care about the Avengers in the slightest any more. The comic-book film I'm most looking forward to is Tintin though.

Although this year is really quite tame compared to the complete insanity that next year will bring with Spiderman, Superman and Batman all in the space of a few months.
 
 
Jeez, 2012 is going to be the biggest year in comic book film history, is it not?

You have the juggernauts; Superman, Batman and Spider-Man, the combination of Marvel heroes in The Avengers and in the background (being squashed to death by the juggernauts) Wolverine 2 and Ghost Rider 2.

I still maintain that it's going to be another Spiderman 3. Thor has also, wisely, dumbed down the 'magic' or 'supernatural' aspect of its story, and turned it into science. Amidst other great releases from other genres, don't think I'll be going to see any in the cinema except for X-Men.

You upset Christian Bale's intense concentration.  
 
 
Feel like going on a film binge, which I haven't done in ages. I think I'm going to watch a new film a day for a week. Any suggestions from people? Only rule is I can't have seen it before, doesn't matter if it's good, bad, mainstream, obscure... I'll try and get a review out of each one I see. It would be nice to get a bit of variation as well.

That rules out absolutely every porn film ever made, then.

 
 
 
Wait, didn't see the part about bad films being allowed. We should just recommend really awful films, put him through some torture...

If you want a more focused film binge, you can't go wrong with the work of John Huston. Obviously, watching every film he's ever done is going to be difficult, but the man made an unreal number of classic films (as well as some ridiculous duds like Escape to Victory). You could also do something with the lesser-known and under-appreciated Scorsese works; The King of Comedy, After Hours, The Age of Innocence, The Color of Money, etc.

I want to watch at least one bad film, just because I don't feel like I watch enough bad ones.   I'm definitely going to take one or two from your list - I'd never even heard of Big Fish!

I'm starting tonight with Sin City. For some reason I never got around to seeing that...

Yeah, I wouldn't mind going through someone's work at one point (month-long Hitchcock session   ). Fancy a bit of breadth at the minute though.
 
 
Decided on my list largely based on my pile of unwatched:

Day 1: Sin City
Day 2: Big Fish
Day 3: Perfume
Day 4: Middle Men
Day 5: Machete
Day 6: Slacker Uprising
Day 7: Venus

Breadth. Hmm. Okay:

John Huston's The Dead (best adaptation of a James Joyce work I've seen, though admittedly there haven't been too many)
Kind Hearts and Coronets
Greenberg
Punch-Drunk Love
Double Indemnity
The Element of Crime
Chungking Express
L'Avventura (I hate this movie, but it's adored by film buffs. Very polarizing.)
Weekend (again, quite polarizing, but I enjoyed it)
Synecdoche, New York

edit: too laaaaate
 
 
The Room, Phalanges, watch The Room. Greatest movie ever.
 
 
Just watched "Red Dawn", and it's absolutely brilliant.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_I4WgBfETc 
 
 
Sin City is a true work of art.

EDIT: And one of the most disgusting reviews I've ever read -  http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/218296_sincity01q.html

Or do you mean with adverts in the corner/at the bottom? I dislike that as well.

Yep, they're all people I really like. I'm pretty excited about seeing it now, thanks for telling me about it!

The biggest stumbling block I have at the minute for this binge seems to be finding a cheap version of Venus. For a film that's only five years old with two very talented actors and an Oscar nomination it seems so bloody obscure.

 
Am I the only one who really struggles to watch films on ITV/Channel 4/any other channel with adverts?

 

Yeah, I usually record them and then fast forward through, but it still doesn't exactly help the immersion. The only films I really consider watching with ad breaks now are the docs More 4 sometimes shows, because they're really good and nowhere else shows them.

 
Yes.

It's pretty silly, people find faults in every film but yeah I've seen people on online forums accusing it of uber feminism and ushering some high feminist agenda on movie going audiences, sexualisation and objectification of women, criticising it for not having a male hero, it just goes on and on and on

people should take a movie for what it is, reading that far into it, you'll always find something wrong and hate it
 
 
 
The biggest stumbling block I have at the minute for this binge seems to be finding a cheap version of Venus. For a film that's only five years old with two very talented actors and an Oscar nomination it seems so bloody obscure.

 

It's available for rental on LOVEFiLM, why not sign up for the free trial, order it, watch it, then cancel your 'membership' before the free period runs out and you have to start paying anything.  
 
 
I'd like to watch something today, not sure what...

Don't you have to have a shortlist of films though and get one sent out from that list, rather than just picking the one you want? I tried it once years ago and remember that happening a lot.

Watch Big Fish, then we can compare notes.  
 
 
Also everyone remember to do an Inception review for the reviewing competition!

And if anyone fancies doing a bit of reading take a look at this thread:  http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/show....php?t=1564587  - it would be great to get a few more votes.
 
 
hahaha found the name of that film 'Battle for Terra', the plot and all is awfully similar to a very popular successful film, I needn't say anymore but yeah

Most of the criticism I've seen has been that Snyder basically focuses on visual flair and style over everything else, leaving the audience with a very pretty, but ultimately insubstantial film. I haven't seen Sucker Punch, but based on his past work, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case. I don't really rate him.
 
 
Pfaagh, Jurassic Park lost to Metropolis.
 
 
Crap, I forgot about the Inception review comp

Still 3 days left!
 
 
I'm about to watch Interview With the Vampire   Will let you guys know what I think of it afterwards...

I've decided it's probably best that I don't enter the Inception review competition. I realise I've had ages to write it, but I always do stuff at the last minute, and I didn't realise the deadline would be when I was on holiday   Oh well... I'll enter the next one, I promise!

Okay, as a long time fan of Star Wars, I'm happy to say that I'm voting for both Alien and Aliens. If there's anything at all I can do about it, it will not come down to Star Wars v Empire Strikes Back.

Of those that are left, I'd go for Serenity, Aliens or Blade Runner.

Toughest decision of my life but I went with Back to the Future. Sorry, man.  
 
 
Watched Paul. Agree with the consensus that it's not up to par with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz (Edgar Wright films). Still eagerly anticipating the third film in the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy, 'The World's End'.

You don't need to worry about that, given that 2001 will smash through Empire Strikes Back.

*And saw Interview with a vampire today... great film, one of the best vampire films I've ever seen, I like the more traditional portrayal of them as opposed to sparkling in sunlight Twilight style. Brad Pitt and Tom cruise in the same film too, nice

Is that all anyone can say about it? Jeez. Try looking at it in its own right, how about that? It's a good film.

Will it, though? 2001 is very good, but Star Wars is more populist. And ESB is the best Star Wars film.

I was quite interested in Sucker Punch, but it seems critics are reacting badly. Anyone seen it, or seeing it?

I did.

It was nothing special.
 
 
Rooting for a 2001 vs Blade Runner final.

Also, Empire is probably the highest form of sci-fi entertainment...but 2001 is just something else.
 
 
Next up: Shoot 'Em Up. Nothing like having a shoot out whilst having hot sex.
 
 
 
Will it, though? 2001 is very good, but Star Wars is more populist. And ESB is the best Star Wars film.

 

Ah, but 2001 carries that superiority feel if you vote for it, because it's more of a work of art. Although in reality form would suggest ESB will blow it out of the water, given that 2001 was only able to just get past the Fifth Element.

A just final would be Blade Runner vs 2001, that would be pretty awesome. I can't imagine anything will even remotely trouble Blade Runner on the way to winning the whole thing though.
 
 
There will be dire consequences if Inception beats 2001.

(just voted, and it's quite close...)

Inception is overrated.
 
 
 
hopefully not :/

Hmm... I just watched it. I have to say I wasn't overly impressed   I quite liked all the old fashioned stuff, I just thought all the modern-day parts and the whole 'interview' thing seemed really forced and weird. I understand that it's based on a book, but really it wouldn't have made any difference if they'd just ditched all the new bits...

I agree that it's better than all the Twilight-style crap, though (not that I've ever actually seen Twilight   )

Also, hot vampires  
 
 
Solaris should've gone up against 2001, that would have been fitting.

And Metropolis should go against Blade Runner, which'd also be fitting. Although I wouldn't have been able to vote.

Sad at how few foreign films got through, only Metropolis and Akira got past round 1. Still can't get over how Metropolis lost to Jurassic Park, probably due to it's small audience.

You realise that the whole point of Twilight is hot vampires?

Well, that and a fat unpopular girl's fantasy about how high school should have gone.

But I don't find any of the guys in Twilight hot  

Robert Pattinson does look like a foot, though   And that picture is genius...
 
 
I'd remove that before Phalanges pops in.  
 
 
 
I did.

It was nothing special.

 

xD mehh Paul is forgettable imo. Pegg and Frosts' best work is behind them, not to say that they can't make another good film - just need another great concept

well fair enough, yeah agreed the acting did seem a bit 'odd' in places, then again Louis was like a 200 year old vampire and all, the dialogue wasn't ever gonna be that normal, it took a while to get used to haha

I'm not too familiar with the book though, another vampire novel I do like - The Vampire Diaries, also watch the TV show   it's not that bad

why is Tom Cruise so good at 'playing' crazy, nutjob characters... maybe he's just playing Tom cruise

'Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter' seems pretty interesting... actually really want to see that

Haha, yeah.  
 
 
Carrying on with my Maggie Smith binge, I watched California Suite. She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this and I think it's probably one of the best supporting performances I've ever seen. What's funny is that hardly anyone knows about it because besides Smith's and Michael Caine's scenes, the film is so so so so average.

I really quite like the idea of a bracketing thing for films, despite how reductive it is really. I might have a word with the admins and see if we can try something around June/July...
 
 
Is there a type of films any of you particularly dislike? I can't stand 'dumb comedies' or the piss take films. They annoy me to the bone!

Parody films. Well, I used to like them but Date Movie, Superhero Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie and Vampires Suck have turned me cold.

Hopefully Johnny English, Austin Powers 4 and the future Pegg-Frost-Wright film will fix that.

Look at this  The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It    but an awesome title.

I really tried to watch them and attempt to indulge. But: Date Movie?? Meet the Spartans? I though Twilight was bad - but Vampires Suck? :s

It's almost as if they are trying to ruin the viewing experience....
All in all I'm glad I'm not the only one

"I feel like something's bad coming my way.. like seeing an asian person driving a car"

Scary movie 3 - watching now. Charlie Sheen being in it just makes it awesome again, retro-winning

Romcoms generally... don't watch too many of them - also period dramas, so boring
 
 
 
Watch Big Fish, then we can compare notes.  

 

No go, unfortunately - I can't really go out and get new movies at the moment, so it'll have to be something I already have.   Tell me if you think it's a must-watch, and I'll try and see it shortly.

I might watch Metropolis, I've been looking forward to that for quite some time now...

The first 30-45 minutes is incredibly dull, largely because it's really unengaging. However, if you stick with it then after about an hour it morphs into something really quite touching. I wouldn't describe it as must-watch - it's not built as thoroughly or as well as Forrest Gump - but in it's own small way it feels more personal. It's probably worth checking out if you've got the time and the inclination.

One thing I found particularly sweet was how different actors play the characters at different ages except for Helena Bonham Carter; it's as if Burton can't imagine her any different to how she is now.
 
 
Natalie Portman's in like 4... major films this year if you count Black Swan as this year too, Thor is gonna be great

Also, anyone with a twitter. let's follow each other and stuff

OK yes she is BUT two of them are gonna be crap...

Black Swan was amazing - that's a given.
Thor might be quite good or a complete waste of time...hopefully good.
No Strings Attached = URGH (btw so weird she and Mila Kunis, both just having given brilliant performances in Black Swan, have gone on to make No Strings Attached and Friends With Benefits respectively...)

Hmmm, sounds quite interesting - I'll have to check it out sometime.

I watched Metropolis today, and really liked it. The plot was quite good, though I thought the ending was a bit dodgy, but what really struck me was the techniques they used to convey the fundamentals of each scene: I though the superimpositions and symbolism both worked well to accentuate the tone of the movie. I haven't really watched many old movies (this is easily the oldest I've ever seen), so perhaps I should and try to figure how much of a technical landmark this was in film-making...

EDIT: Wrt Natalie Portman, isn't Hesher also out this year? That could well be a very good movie...

Today's kinda chilled.. not as hot and sunny as last saturday unfortunately
 
 
I haven't seen Black Swan yet, but I'm guessing it was a good film 'cause of the Oscars and stuff...

Thor will probably be one of the most popular superhero/comic book films of the year. If the trailer's anything to go by, they've got a pretty strong plot and put the fight and action scenes only where needed...

I thought No Strings Attached was ok, but it looks like Friends With Benefits will have an altogether funnier cast...

Your Highness looks like a mediocre Comedy: enjoyable, but not Award-Winning...

Watching Ladyhawke on Film4- Love the soundtrack  
 
 
The only superhero film i'm interested in this year is X-Men.
 
 
This is a promising idea for a film:  http://www.monstersandcritics.com/mo...s-light-on-OCD 

I think with OCD is that it is well known however at the same time hardly anyone knows what it actually is. Most people associate OCD with ''oh he's so OCD he arranges everything in a straight line'' or ''I just cleaned my room I'm so OCD!'' - In reality and for people who suffer it is incredibly serious and lot more sinister and life effecting than just that. According to statistics a great deal of people suffer from it, however it's not really highlighted much in the media tv/ films etc

While I'm going to give money for it I really don't expect anything to come of it. I hope it does, however.

Metropolis lost to Jurassic Park, what a ****ing tragedy.

Also everyone needs to get into Japanese cinema, it's godly. Quite tempted to make a World Cinema (and Music?) soc at uni, not sure how popular it'd be though, as there are already two film socs already.

A good place to start is Seven Samurai, then pretty much all of Kurosawa's films; Ikiru, Ran (based on King Lear), Throne of Blood (based on Macbeth), Rashomon, Hidden Fortress, Dersu Uzala, Yojimbo...

Some of my other personal favourites (from other directors) are; Tokyo Story (Ozu), The Human Condition I, II & III (Kobayashi - Usual Suspects?), Ugetsu (Mizoguchi).

Ugestu is Mizoguchi's most famous work, but I prefer Sansho the Bailiff, mainly due to this ghostly scene...(spoiler).

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuQ6FWL3HJc 

It's quite unlike anything you will ever see.

A few years ago (before Batman Begins and the seriousness that followed) they were planning to make a Green Lantern film with Jack Black as a far more comedic take compared to the relatively straight route this Ryan Reynolds version seems to be taking. Which one would you have preferred to see?

I would have hated for it to be Jack Black, and really I don't feel that Green Lantern is appropriate for a comedy. In general, I prefer the more serious superhero films. Green Hornet is an exception; I think that could have been done the way it was or straight.

Ohhh Charlie Sheen. To think that he was once employed by Disney.

 

Makes you miss Mask of Zorro. Remember that film?  

 
 

 

Been cheating on me with futuredoc... I see you went with the doctor over the lawyer.  

 
Oh hai misscupcakes, haven't seen ya round here for a while

It's a good film. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. End shootout is extremely brief but awesome.
 
 
2 days until the last episode of Silk. If you haven't watched it already and don't have anything to watch, I recommend it:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode...ilk_Episode_1/

Is 3:10 to Yuma worth watching?  
 
 
It's not the greatest western ever or anything, but it's solid entertainment and features some enjoyable performances, Ben Foster being particularly good.

To be quite honest I was cheating on the doctor with the lawyer in the first place  

and thanks for the rep this morning btw   made me wonder until the doc told me what it was about  
 
 
Keeping Mum is much better than I thought it was going to be, it might have been Patrick Swayze's last film? I'm too lazy to be googling such things.

Yes! So good. I need more cheesy swashbuckling action films in my life. Swords > guns every time.
 
 
Anyone else looking forward to Source Code?
 
 
Source Code looks very good, i'm hearing great things about it too.

Could anyone recommend me a film.. maybe a comedy that I could watch before I sleep? Nothing too heavy..
 
 
Anyone seen The Lincoln Lawyer yet? Have a feeling I may have missed discussion on this, but yeah, worth a watch?

Anyone else looking forward to Source Code?

 

Yeah, the premise is cool but I found out that Jakes' character is sent back just 8 minutes in time to stop the disaster that happens and save the day... just 8 minutes, yeah still bit of a task

****

I ended up just watching Burn after Reading, found it actually quite funny, Brad Pitt and george clooney are hilarious in it
 
 
 
Source Code looks very good, i'm hearing great things about it too.

 

I'm not sure what to think until I see it tbh... I loved Moon and i think the cast looks VERY good and obviously I've heard really good reviews but... I think the premise reminds me a bit too much of Twelve Monkeys and Assassin's Creed lol. But yeah it should be good I hope!

You mean like the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film?  

Then came along Legend of Zorro... What did you think of that? Catherine-Zeta Jones is extremely attractive in the Zorro films. I've... observed.

xD yeah exactly, he's hilarious as an angry man character, him and Tom Cruise

and Ape   you may be the first Tsr user since the legendary Profresh to get the legendary blue gems, then the flashing multi-coloured gems

no one believes you can get them, cos no one's seen them in 4 years  
 
 
 
 

About time I watched a film.

 

watch 'Push' if you're a fan of sci-fi action movies and cool effects... it's gotten fairly bad reviews from some critics but who cares, I think it's great   also, Chris Evans is in it. He's great in action roles
 
 
 
Anyone seen The Lincoln Lawyer yet? Have a feeling I may have missed discussion on this, but yeah, worth a watch?  

 

I saw it. I enjoyed watching it, it's certainly suspenseful which is the point, but it's nothing overly special. It's like the majority of crime stuff, once you've seen it you won't watch it again because you know "whodunnit" and how it ends.

Yeah, I'm not holding out much hope for next Pirates, not after the utter brain boggle that was the third film. Legend of Zorro wasn't anywhere near as good as the first one, but I guess sequels rarely are. It also annoys me that the kid is incapable of recognising his own FATHER with a little black mask on. Fair enough, the films were never made to be realistic but that's a stretch too far.

One word: Superman.

Oh look, a building is crumbling I'm just going to randomly nip into a grocery to pick up some food I conveniently forgot to buy. Superman suddenly appears and bears a striking resemblance to Kent except no glasses. Therefore it can't be Kent.

That'd be a good Specsavers advert.

What makes it all worse is that Lois is supposed to be a journalist, for crying out loud. Being observative is her job.

Anyways, I discovered the Bechdel test the other day and since then I've been applying it to loads of different films- it's actually shocking how many don't pass!

She's a fine actress who exudes exactly the confidence needed for the part, even if she doesn't necessarily match up visually. Lois Lane was originally a redhead anyway, so if they don't correct that then they have a legitimate anti-fanboy excuse.  

Anyway, I remain confident that this is going to suck. It's hard to get away from the fact that this film is going to combine Zack Snyder with the biggest Marty Stu ever, so anything good that comes of it will almost certainly be accidental.

yep, I agree that she's a great actress and all but I just can't really see her as Lois Lane.... dunno if she'd have the comic timing right or play off Clark Kent/superman that well *shrugs* we'll just have to wait and see

Lol. It's funny that people are saying that now since Sucker Punch has had a wide release, I hope it won't suck but it's what another reboot technically, it's not a sequel to Superman returns as the cast is changed again. It's hard to tell exactly how audiences will take it in

I dunno about Natalie in superhero films. I'm waiting for Thor to judge but I dunno...that and things like No Strings Attached. I don't think they suit her!
 
 
Looks like Empire is going to win. Serenity is also beating Terminator.....?

edit; at least it won't be an all Star Wars final. If Blade Runner doesn't beat Serenity...it won't be the first tragedy.
Pfah, Serenity is inferior to all the films it beat bar the first - Spider Man.

The Empire vs Blade Runner...
 
 
My hopes are on Blade Runner, my money's on ESB.

yeah I'm the same, have to wait and see how she does in Thor but I believe in her ability to act well in a range of roles

kinda agree, but again she seems to able to slot into different genres which is never a bad thing. She has drama, fantasy, sci-fi down so far anyway. Rom-com... maybe not hah

you a big Rachel Bilson fan btw

Wouldn't say big fan but I liked her in The OC and... I suppose Jumper wasn't bad lol. She's just the default setting of my brain when I think "brunette, 20s, associated with comic books" cos of the Wonder Woman bit in The OC lol.

BY THE WAY does anyone else find it strange that Smallville is meant to be "young" Superman yet Tom Welling is older than both Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill?

Well, considering he started Smallville when he was ~23   And Smallville has moved away from that, they had a 'No tight, no flight' rule which is hinted at being broken (and has been to some extent).
 
 
Smallville's still on?

Spoiler:
Smallville should have ended last season IMO. I think the whole Red-Blue blur disguise etc was a bit cringy, and the use of Zod as the villain was long overdue. I think they rushed most of it. Don't get me started on the "fight" with Doomsday, it made me stop watching it for about 5 episodes. Trainwreck.
But the earlier seasons were the reason why I watched it for so long, it was a great alternative to watching the earlier films and the more recent ones. Great background story etc.
 
 
For those of us that are on Smallville Season 4, spoilers would be appreciated.

Yeah, it went a little downhill. Earlier seasons were great, I liked the sort of feel they gave off. The blur was fail. Doomsday was a complete letdown.

But they're saying the finale is going to be the best ever and live up to everyone's expectations/everything we wanted. Not been watching this season. But I'm going to give it a try near the finale.

Terminator 2 will probably be the biggest tragedy of that round. I doubt anyone will ever make a better action flick.

I have no idea about anything Star Trek except the 2009 film. I've already formed a bias that it doesn't deserve to be there and have made a habit of voting against it.  

Terminator 1 shouldn't be in there, if 2 had been against Serenity it would have given Serenity a real run for its money and probably even beaten it.

I really hope they end how they started, in terms of the quality of course! But I'm really glad that will mean Smallville will finish in time to anticipate the Man of Steel film in 2012 =].
I'm sure it's not coincidental though!

And nahhh, I've been working a lot this year, but I plan on watching it on the internet sometime,  . Have you been? Is it building up to a great finale?

Nope, not been watching it at all. I'm the same as you, but yeah planning on watching it soon. Something oddly satisfying, when catching up, about not having to wait another week for the next episode. It should raise the anticipation for Snyder's film.

Thinking of getting into some Superman comics (Red Son, Kingdom Come and others) inbetween the Smallville finale and the film.

You don't mess with the Zohan is so funny xD loved the last 10-15 minutes of it

Not a smallville fan but may just draft myself in to watch Season 10 and see how it ends, watched it intermittently all over the place whenever it's on

I've also just gotten into 'Castle', Nathan Fillion's awesome, he's really good with comedic timing and being a lead in general but yeah I quite like it
 
 
 
Watched 3:10 to Yuma yesterday loved it so much, thought it was better than True Grit.

Watching You don't mess with the Zohan now, so funny at times, don't normally do stupid funny, but this is hilarious. The main guy is so awesome, I think he could take Jason Bourne, he's that skilled  

 

Me too! Was 3:10 to Yuma on Five or FilmFour, I don't remember? It actually made me well up in the end, when Christian Bale dies. So good.

Guess what. I'm watching You Don't Mess With The Zohan now too! Makes me want to become hairdresser... NOT. But, it's still very funny!
 
 
Kingdom Come

Glad you approve.   Delving into all these in June. Red Son seems to have a very interesting premise and Kingdom Come sounds exciting. Though I'm best checking out the background of some DC heroes as cambo suggested a while back.

In your opinion, (in addition to Dark Knight Returns, Year One, The Killing Joke) is Long Halloween also worth checking out?

Definitely! And Dark Victory, which is the sequel to The Long Halloween. Haunted Knight is by the same guys, in the same general continuity, and worth it if you can spare the time/money.
 
 
Machete is freakin' awesome. My opinion of Robert Rodriguez has skyrocketed over the last week.

 Hilarious Review 

 
If it had not been preceded by ANTICHRIST, MACHETE probably would be the worst movie ever made. Not only is it full of gruesome, despicable, extremely bloody violence, graphic nudity, extreme sex, racism, and Anti-American content, it is also very poorly acted and directed.

I've not actually seen much of Smith's work. Might give Clerks a watch later on. Also, just after googling around found out that Zack and Miri Make a Porno was done by Kevin Smith! It definitely had a certain Apatow feel to it, could just be Seth Rogen though...

Clerks is brilliant, still feels fresh after 17 odd years. Chasing Amy is arguably better, and is also probably his most mature film (although I haven't seen Jersey Girl, so don't quote me on that). None of them are exceptionally directed, and he has made some genuinely bad movies (Cop Out, the mess of misguided fanservice that is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back), but his body of work is largely enjoyable.  
 
 
Not to forget that Red State is out soon which looks fairly promising.

The dialogue in clerks is hilarious, just the scenarios and things they talk about. Haven't seen Clerks 2 though but I'd like too

great points they raised, how many Stormtroopers did die in the splosion of the first death star and didn't other surviving troopers know the design was flawed, why would they willingly work at the New, 2nd death star

Stormtrooper: Oh hey, yeah I just got a new shift, patrolling the space around coruscant, long hours and all but the nights in the city are mad. Hell the whole planet is a city afterall, where have you been moved to?

Stormtrooper 2: Oh, just the new death star that's still being built... minimum wage pay, SUPER long hours. It's a shame about the first, those damn rebels must have like had the design plans or something or used 'the force' cos it was damn near indestructible, right

stormtrooper: Yeah... indestructible, you do know the whole system has one huge major flaw right, that undermines the whole thing, getting asigned to the death star is practically a death sentence... you should get a transfer **** dude

Stormtrooper 2: Nah I'm sure they worked it up, cemented over the exhaust port or something. I'll be fine

stormtrooper: I hope so. For your sake

His dialogue is a joy to behold.  

As for Star Wars, there shouldn't be any sound in space either. You can find all kinds of logical wrinkles with that most wonderful series (this one is the best:  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...EndorHolocaust  ), but it's generally best to pretend that all of the impossible stuff that happens in the Star Wars galaxy happens in a universe where all of it is possible.  
 
 
Also there's this other film set in a restaurant with Ryan Reynolds about the things he does with work colleagues to pass time, it's a bit quirky and alternative like Clerks. I'll find the name soon (really want to watch it)

It's called 'Waiting...'

Randomly came across a trailer for Gus Van Sant's new film, it looks terrible

It has reminded me that I still need to watch Blue Valentine though...
 
 
It's such a coincidence that I watched Rope yesterday and then discovered that Farley Granger died today. He gave such a subtle performance, but one that was perfectly pitched. RIP Granger.
 
 
Character cameo in Thor is interesting

Cool film. Kind of like 3 stories mixed in here. But this one really stuck out.

Spoiler:
Josh Radnor bumps into some kid in the subway. He kind of gets left behind and so on. A cool kind of friendship builds.

The entire cast did a great job. You'll like this film if you're into Spoiler:
happy endings.
 
 
For what it is, Battle: Los Angeles is pretty good. It won't be winning any awards, but it kept me well entertained for a couple of hours  
 
 
Wanna see The Eagle. Also want to see Jamie Bell in more roles in big budget films, pretty talented actor
 
 
I haven't actually saw a movie in ages.  
 
 
  Hailee Steinfeld is reportedly attached to an as-yet-unnamed project based on the fairytale Sleeping Beauty.
 
 
So, when you think of potential actresses to play Agatha Christie's celebrated lady detective, does this woman pop into your head?

If Shia Le Bouef ever plays Poirot I will kill someone.
