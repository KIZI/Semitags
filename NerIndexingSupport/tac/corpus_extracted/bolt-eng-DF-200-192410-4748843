With the World's most beautiful woman thread so popular, i thought we needed a bit of balance here!
I think James Mcavoy  http://www.channel4.com/entertainmen...mcavoy_300.jpg  is Beautiful!
 
 
a bit of a generic answer but Johnny Depp all the way!! I honestly think he is the most perfect looking man on the planet.
Im practically salivating just thinking of him haha
 
 
obvious really: the two best looking men are my boyfriend and Johnny Depp  
 
 
  Johnny Depp is beautiful!! #MB#

oh so very sure  
 
 
Am i the only person who doesnt think Johnny Depp is that hot?

Cristiano Ronaldo is the worlds most beautiful man in my opinion, obviously.  

Ricky Martin, Enrigue Iglesias and Wilmer Valderrama all come a close second though.

*sweats* um...er...that's not true...!
 
 
 

i don't care what anyone says ben affleck is perfect!!

so is he

 
 
 
Jude Law *swoons* and George Clooney- there is something about him that makes you think he would be brilliant with women..and he's handsome (yes, old, but handsome!) and has a lovely voice.

Nope, you're not the only one...he's good-looking, sure, but not that much.

I like Tom Welling, Wentworth Miller, Chad Michael Murray (ha dont we all   ) and Jake Gyllenhaal    
 
 
There are hoardes of women who faint at the very sight of Johnny Depp but I don't think he's that nice...nor Clooney.

I think James D'Arcy is fit he's been in a few Poirot's, damn! And John Barrowman and Tom welling. I used to be obsessed with Orlando Bloom and make buckets of saliva over him but not any more. Now I love Michael Palin

Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is great.

 http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0182666/ 
 
 
Without a doubt, Cillian Murphy

 
 
 
that manny from lost who is all hairy - SAWYER.
 
 
I myself have the most ridiculous crush on a certain Michael Shanks  

 

He has a really really nice body too  

-ahem-

More 'obvious' choices would be Jensen Ackles, as someone already suggested:

 
(Google him, seriously, you won't regret it  

And his partner in crime, Jared Padelecki

 

Wowzers.

and jude law:
 http://www.georgecaroll.com/male%20s...aw/jud_law.jpg 

they're my top 4
 
 
Wentworth Miller is the most beautiful man on the planet.

FACT.
 
 
Dermot Mulroney, yes please. Jared Padalecki, yes yes please.

I'm gonna have to say Matt Willis... in a non-conventional sort of phwoarness.
 
 
Ah! Everytime I see Matt Willis now I think of that guy who was in Big Brother for a couple of days  
 
 
I am seconding (thirding? uh fourthing? whatever) Jensen Ackles

 

and Jared (lol love whoever photoshpped this 2x the nekkid)

 

Gale Harold-why is he bare footed in a window? I don't know. Do I care? not one bit

 
 
 
 

 

 
Rob Lowe from the West Wing  

 

 
Gym Class Heroes dude.

 
Tyson Ritter of All American Rejects (lame band but besides the point..)

 

 
 
 
My favs at the moment, in order (with commentry):-

Wentworth Miller (from the Mariah Carey videos! I think he looked best in those..yumm)
Ioan Gruffudd (in Boy and Man)
Michael Vartan (Monster-in-Law. Never followed ALIAS so..)
Hugh Dancy (Blood and Chocolate, not a very good film-it had potential- but his yumminess was decently displayed!)
 
 
Tuomas Holopainen

 http://material.talentum.com/talentu...es/1053832.jpg 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Without wanting to sound in the least bit cheesy and girly I actually think my boyfriend is the hottest guy ever. Never come across anyone more amazingly good looking, actual perfection  

Dougie poynter though when hes not looking quite so 'emo' has a really beautiful face
 

Id soooooo give one to Quinn Allman aswell
 
 
 
 Ian Somerhalder 
 
 
 

 

 

 

i think that's enough  
 
 
who's the first one? ^^ i feel like i recognise him
 
 
 
Originally Posted by lucyb-90

patrick dempsey, mcdreamy from grey's anatomy!!
 
 
 

This guy is the sex. I bet he's so dominant in bed  
 
 
I really dig the 'hot geek' look the Rob Lowe has. I would also consider:

 

 

But really, lets face it girls, the answer is so very obvious.

Mmmm Jose Mourhino is HOT. Also, whoever said Tyson Ritter, I agree - yum.

But Rob Lowe?? NO way, he's so cheesy and American looking  
 
 
Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow pure RAWR
 
 
Prison Break aka Wentworth Miller... but only minus the hair...
 
 
the guy who plays Aragorn in Lord of the Rings, but only as that character, he doesn't look right blonde. Not the hottest guy in the world but I felt he deserved a mention!
 
 
Some of my favourites:

Cesc Fabregas
Robin Van Persie
Jonathan Rhys Meyers
Frederic Michalak
Milo Ventimiglia

When I was about 16 I used to be in love with Legolas...not Orlando, though. There's a difference, yes.

He's ok, but I've only seen pictures of him when he looks like he needs a shower

I um... think that might be part of his appeal to some people.    

In any case, he's better: ;yes;

 

as is he:

 
 
 
The D&G one? That's David Gandy
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnXePJBhVA 
 
 
junglemonkey could equally be referring to the British Dior Fahrenheit ad or the Chanel Allure Homme Sport one.
 
 
I love practically all the men on this thread!
 
 
David Beckham is beautiful!

 http://enscreenshots.softonic.com/s2...kham4_1024.jpg 

 http://www.virginmedia.com/microsite...dads/img_1.jpg 

He is just yummy.

And Jesse Metcalf (with slightly less scary eyebrows) is a stunner! And in terms of older men, George Clooney is my shouldn't but definitely would!
 
 
jeremy irons. brains and beauty. you'd have to hear him speak to see how lovely he really is!

hahaha, you said it not me  

And to Schokis, when I read the book (before the film came out) I thought Legolas was hot, like in my mind, if that makes sense. And I thought Aragorn was a sleaze for liking two girls! haha
 
 
 
giannis aevazis, actor

You know, I did actually think when I started watching Heroes that he was a really good looking man.

I would agree that some of the men here are very good looking - like Johnny Depp and Jude Law - but it's beyond me how someone like Christiano Ronaldo could be mentioned in the same sentence as the word 'beautiful'; he's got 'I'm a self-obsessed ****' written all over his face. And he looks like a kid.

PS. I am straight, honest

yes, you're totally right! one of my friends said she couldn't see why I like him because "he's old and scarred"...mm that's part of his charm  
 
 
I'm a guy, but I appreciate hotness. With that said, I nominate

Patrick Dempsey
Tom Welling
Jensen Ackles

Oh, and James Franco.
 
 
matt damon is fit as well

i now like ashley taylor dawson (darren on hollyoaks coz he adds the comedy to it)

you look a bit like him I think actually.
 
 
Upen Patel
 
 

John Abraham
 

Dino Morea
 
 
 
 
 

Zach Braff, I just find him really cute looking  
 
 
 
Owen Wilson.
Don't ask me why but I like his nose. I generally like people who look a bit different to the whole clothes-catalogue boring definition of good-looking.

 
Ralph Fiennes.
He does the quiet, tortured English thing pretty well in his films.

 
Keanu Reeves.
Striking-looking even if he isn't that great an actor.

 
Richard Armitage.
AKA Guy of Gisbourne rocking the pleather and eye-liner in that crappy Robin Hood remake the BBC did a while ago (he was the only good thing in it!).

 
Jimi Hendrix.
When he was alive, obviously.

As for the person who mentioned Micheal Palin, I've got a friend who likes him and Bob Geldof, another who loves Bono and another who thinks Darren Brown is nice.  
 
 
definitely gotta be wentworth miller

Wow, you guys actually made a thread for me   Thanks everyone  
 
 
Well there is the God of perfection that is Johnny Depp

 

But I can't seem to stop thinking about Rupert Grint lately

 

And then of course there is the super sexy, super nerdy Topher 'Forman' Grace

 

Oh the choices

I think it's to do with the dark, medium length hair which is sort of curly. Maybe I subconsciously thought he was good looking because I'm self-obsessed and saw a resemblance

Cliche; I know, but I'd have to agree that Johnny Depp is perfection.

Mathias Lauridsen and this guy are both rather beautiful too...  Gaspard Ulliel 
 
 
christian bale   he's just so perfectly handsome!

 
 
 
Does anyone else like Johnny Burrell?
 
 
I say Cillian Murphy. He's my avatar. But it's definately not the best picture of him out there.
 
 
Yep, I'd agree with Christian Bale. Especially since Batman...

I'd also add in Peter from Heroes a.k.a Milo Ventimiglia and Julian Rhind-Tutt to the melting pot of male, erm, goodness.

Jesse Metcalfe for that gorgeous cheeky look he has, and also that looooverly body he has

Nope, just looked at it now though! Some odd people on the internet these days  
 
 
'I can say “I am resonating with the presence of a new house” but if my inner guidance system or emotions ‘balks’ when I say that or I feel I’m not making an honest statement about what I’m saying then I might as well be mumbling a nursery rhyme (by the way this is why ‘positive thinking’ sometimes fails).'

I see.....  
 
 
for some reason, axl rose looks beautiful in this picture
and i do believe it's the only one i've ever seen of him that's good looking
 
 
He looks like a lady there!

Er, yeah, thats what it is  
 
 
mmmm.. hot guys...

I am generally quite fickle on my opinion of the world's most beautiful man. However I think it depends on what you classify as beautiful, the most beautiful guy I know is beautiful both because of his looks and intelligence. Intelligence is beauty not just general looks hence it is incredibly hard to judge whether celebs are "beautiful" because we don't know them.

Personally a man of beauty is Jonny Depp, who has always (until his most recent choices) chosen a quirky character in a film, quirkiness is his appeal. In his interview his great intelligence is revealing thus contributing to his beauty in my eyes.
 
 
Johnny Depp all the way and Christian Bale is pretty hot too
 
 
Patrcik Swayze at his prime. in my opinion.

 
 http://www.imdb.com/gallery/granitz/...0Patrick&seq=4 

I didn´t even know who he was until I was told I look like him, which is good then lol

YUUUUUSSSS
he wins for me by a mile :OP

edit:
on second thought he doesn't win, because he s not really beautiful, he's just charistmic and the most amazing person ever
but, he's not most beautiful...
um so far on this thread I'd say James McAvoy or Johnny Depp
in fact last night my mum was going on about how beautiful Johnny Depp was in Edward Scissorhands and she doesn't say stuff like that often
"he is just so beautiful, so beautiful, he just is" or something like that, so I'd say he has to win because in some things i.e. no POTC he is beautiful as opposed to just 'hot'

Patrick Swayze was nice back in the day!
I feel quite wrong for saying that though, Im not sure why

and I hardly know of Freddie Ljungberg but yes him too, his body is beautiful like artwork really

"Chad Michael Murray (ha dont we all )" - who? seriously? i don't knoew of him

edit: just thought. the guys from Buffy were generally quite nice :OP
but then, I've only just watched Buffy (yes im many years behind) so I would think of that before most ppl, and I'm only up to Season 3

edit:the guys I heroes whose father was murdered.. he is beautiful

and in Love Actually, when i frist saw it I loved his story the best,
there is some bit where he zips up his top and paces around and keeps changing his mind and turning around
and apprently, he did many turns and it was a joke/practise or somethig anf he couldn't beleive they used that take... or something, sorry i heard it ages ago on the DVD
i like that bit, and its all cold and smoke breathy (ya know when u can see your breath, lol) and he zips his top up really high and theres the Dido song playing and like he freaks out some man by hvaing a screaming fit right next to him without warning. quality, lol

They've got to be twins! Both have the same second name, both welsh, they look identical and they both seem to have an aptitude for presenting!

thank you! i've been wondering that for ages but none of my friends watch blue peter. (and i only watch it when im bored and feel like laughing at the fake happiness). their facial features seem really similar and although jones is REALLY common, their hair and physique are just too alike!

I found this on the blue peter website

Q. Do you have any brothers or sisters, and do you get along with them?

(From: Katherine, age 12, London )

A. I have a sister called Mererid. She's 18 months older than me and she's a Physiotherapist. She recently came to watch Blue Peter in the studio and she really enjoyed herself. She's getting married next year and I'm playing the violin at her wedding. Yes we do get on. We don't see much of each other because obviously she's busy with her work and I'm flying, driving, training and biking all over the place for Blue Peter. She lives in Cardiff still, but she's just come back from Uganda where she spent a year doing VSO (Voluntary Services Overseas) and I went to visit her. She's pretty cool and I really respect what she's doing for a living.

Probably...everyone in Wales with the second name Jones is probably related somewhere along the line   "

sorry its all messed up i just copied and pasted, i don't have the botherance to edit it

so i don't think so! *doh*!!!!

edit: on the other hand,m he plays violin, how.. talentful and good, that kind of thing makes me like ppl more, tho of course not every1 hets the chance, i may be really good at violin of my parents had let me, :O( ah my life might be complretely differe, who knows, i realy thought i would have done well at it, so many ppl told me, botherations
 
 
Hmm, I cant believe they could have all those similarities and not be related, but I dont want to ruin the image of there being two people that gorgeous in the world, so I'll just ignore anyone who says they arent related  
Also, maybe they were separated at birth and they dont know it, or maybe there's been a fall out between them... ooo the possibilites!

Woops sorry i didnt realise this thread even existed ohhh great im glad the equilibrium is restored, ha ha. Soz for the confusion!

I dont see any harm in liking Johnny Depp the guys a legend, n im not gunna stop liking him just cuz half a million others do and its so called cliche! lol  

I personally think liking Tom Welling and George Clooney is cliche and slighty over rated. he he.  

This fellas not bad either:   James McAvoy...After watchin him in Becoming Jane! He luks well sexxi in this film!

Lol! Cool thread, OP    

Well my friends and I used to crush on Craig Wing, but I think we have a winner here and his name is Johnny Depp. Which isn't surprising because I definitely rate him too  

Pity he's happily married, last I saw of him he was on a boat declaring his true love for his wife :/ Ah but at the same time it was all very sweet to read a nice story like that, so meh.

It is something about the Dr not the white coat but the scrubs an the stubble they ineviably have from working those looonggg hours. Maybe actually its the stubble in general as jon bon tends to have it too.

Ah well heres to 4 years of hospital placements to find me a suitable Dr

I have to go for Russell Brand...Ignoring all the mad hair etc (though I think that adds to it   ) the man is BEAUTIFUL. Had the pleasure of being about a metre away from him at a show recently and mmmumppphhh he's better up close

Gaspard Ulliel
 

Hayden Christensen
 

Shane West
 

Gael Garcia Bernal
 

Johnny Depp
 

Jonathan Rhys Meyers
 

Goran Visnjic
 

Paul Walker
 

Ashton Kutcher
 

Jake Gyllenhaal
 

Best of all - Adam Brody
 
 
 
Wow. Just wow. Some beauties, and some utter beasts.
I cannot comprehend Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Rupert Grint (sweet Jesus), Christian Ronaldo (or however you spell it), Adrian Pasdar (Nathan from Heroes), Chris Martin or Elvis. And ELIJAH WOOD?!?!

Some of the most feminine and delicate men are to me the most beautiful.

Jared Leto/Ian Somerholder fans, I give you... Chace Crawford
 
Have to bask in the beauty of Jared Leto (in the old days). He looks like a girlier version of my bf haha.
 
Joseph Fiennes (especially in Shakespeare in Love)
 

Jake Gylenhaal is beautiful but not attractive, for some reason.

Oh, and I totally have a strange thing for James Spader as well! He's not even good looking but his character in Bostol Legal phwaor  
 
 
Dear God that Chace Crawford guy is hottttttt.

What's boston legal?   I used to watch Boston Public ages ago (stopped back in 2003/4), is that the same one?
 
 
OOOOOOOH my. I have this poster (well, cut out of a magazine) on my wall. I put it up about three years ago and y'know..awh  

And this advertisement is amazing.
 
 
 
Johnny Depp
Ville Valo
Noel Fieldings
Russell Brand

If we're talking famous men.

But honestly, the most beautiful guy I've ever met is the one I call mine.

I don't think so, Boston Legal is about a law firm? They have the same creator though it seems, David E Kelley
 
 
agreed on Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Johnny Depp, and Chad Michael Murray.

I'm currently lovinggg Penn Badgley (John Tucker Must Die, Gossip Girl):
 
Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe):
 
and Alex Turner isn't the most beautiful guy by any means, but I love his voice and he always makes me laugh during interviews, so I feel obligated:
 

there are definitely more that I'm not thinking of right now, haha
 
 
no one mentioned colin farrell?
 
 
jonny depp
johnathan rhys meyers
clive owen
 
 
Johnny Depp <3
 
 
Okay

OMG YES to:

James McAvoy (accent + pretty + talent = YUM)
Patrick Dempsey
Eric Dane (whoever put McSteamy up)
Jared Leto

and don't anyone hurt me but
 
Daniel Radcliffe (even though he's the shortest person on screen in any potter film)

 
Zac Efron (I'm crossed between thinking he's too pretty for comfort or just extra groomed   )

I know I shouldn't but Christ I do.

and eww to Alex Pettyfer (he's about 12, and has five thousand colours in his hair and has a spotty back. Ew.)
Johnny Depp's fine, but just as Cap'n Sparrow.
 
 
Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice)
Jude Law (All the time)

haha, sorry but I despise him. just not my type--way too pretty. I feel like he wears makeup everyday.
Chance Crawford is a bit better. very similar looking, same type, but less made-up looking. I think you'd like him:

ah I know! he's like really tan in that picture, too. haha. idk--he isn't conventionally handsome. but his voice is fantastic, and I like his personality/sense of humor (which is somewhat sarcastic) from what I've seen in interview and at concerts. he's my current celebrity crush =P
I don't think the alexa chung thing will work out...their names are just way too similar, lol
 
 
Does no-one remember those adverts for Milk in the 90s, that involved a really hot guy jumping into a swimming pool?!
 
 
Young Marlon Brando

 

Paul Newman

 

And last but definitely not least, David Cameron

 
 
 
^ At times David Cameron can look quite the hottie but that is possibly the most unattractive photo of him ever.

By the way, loving some of these photographs. Whoever put Penn Badgley and Chace Crawford up: THANK YOU.

I was just going to post that James Franco reminds me a bit of James Dean.
so I google image him.

I feel like some more Gale Harold Pics seeing as I only know one other person on this forum who watched QAF US

To be honest, though.. what can they do about it? Shave it off?

That's a half-serious question, by the way: What if a guy is naturally hairy and doesn't want to be? Would he simply shave it off? I can't imagine stubble being sexier than hair..

There are seven men I find gorgeous, I call them The Magnificent Seven.

- David Tennant (though I wouldn't say he is beautiful... I just think he oozes charm and he is so cute I just want a cuddle. Will have to refrain that on the day I see him on stage, in July. Erm.)
- Ralph Fiennes (seeing him on stage in March for the 3rd time   )
- Richard Armitage (blue eyes + dark hair + deep voice = I feel weak in the knees)
- Colin Firth (as in Mr Darcy)
- Clive Owen
- Gerard Butler (the Dear Frankie look, not the 300 ugliness)
- Rupert Penry Jones.

I have a bit of a thing for Hugh Laurie too (V. sexy as house but also I like his real accent better) my BF makes fun of me for liking old men  
 
 
So right about Hugh Laurie's real accent, Pixie. When I first watched House, I was so gutted... He could have been a British doctor in America, after all...

Yeah I was watching it thinking 'wow it's like 'smashed' all over again!'
I like his bleached hair too but it did hurt his poor little head hee, I miss the coat more than anything though!

And lol Laced definitely great minds! until proven otherwise hehe
 
 
The coat was very cool. I did like the shorter military-esque one he wore in the first half of series seven though, and the punk look from when he killed the New York slayer.  
He looked amazing most of the time. ;yes;

Oh, so that makes you AND sean who are both straight, and yet seem to spend a considerable amount of time on this thread. Maybe there's something you're both not telling us?    
 
 
well i like to spread my wings so to speak and delve into the unknown
 
 
"Delve" being the operative word there....?

edward norton
 

ryan phillipe
 

caleb followhill (with lovely short hair   )

colin farrell

 

and would definitely second brad pitt, james dean, clive owen, dr carter, cillian murphy, james marsters, river phoenix, jeff buckley, will smith, bret, swayze, jude law, mourinho, owen wilson...  
 
 
Mmm..Jeff Buckely I DO agree with!
 
 
Went to see Sweeney Todd yesterday. It just reminded me how very striking he is visually. I wouldn't say he's handsome but he has very delicate beautiful features and of course, DAMN HOT.
 
 
will smith ey?!

You obviously think about beautiful men a lot more than everyone else then.

Kind of.  
But hey, if you like him, do you really care what other people think?
 
 
No. Although that may only be because my best friend has been obsessed with him for years; I may have just got used to it :P
 
 
I don't find him stunning or anything, but I think he was pretty good looking in his younger days. ;yes;
Plus his voice is lovely.  
 
 
Yeah, he has got an amazing voice. Personally, I find this more attractive:

Ok disclaimer: I am definately not homosexual, but even blokes know when other men are ugly or not and I thought I'd add something different.

Steve Reeves, in my opinion, was probably the most perfectly porportioned male to have ever lived on this planet.

 

He played Hercules haha.

He was basically a living grecian statue.

Yknow I always find it strange when guys say, "Oh I don't know whether he's good looking, I'm not gay." Good for you. ;yes;

I personally think that's a bit OTT on the muscle front, but to each their own and that.

I like this guy after all, and loads of people seem to think he's ugly.

Spoiler:
 
 
 
He's not ugly at all! He's lovely.   You have good taste!

He's alright, a bit too chiseled for my taste tough.
 
 
 

Nicholas Hoult

 

Cillian Murphy

To each their own.

 http://www.jonathan-rhys-meyers.net/...0meyers_01.jpg

Ooooh Henry - good choice. He's got some serious charisma about him. Va va voom?
 
 
Ok so I'm not putting him into the running for worlds most gorgeous guy, but I found him whilst surfing the net today and I was like YUM!

hottie  
 
 
They definitely aren't the most beautiful but...

 

 

 

 

All of them are/were footballers! Haha.

N.B: I'm straight.
 
 
Wow! What a brilliant thread!  

Hmmm-- I have so many favourites, where to start? Orlando Bloom is absolutely lovely of course; Brad Pitt (although he's not what he used to be); Jensen Ackles (just pure hotness), Jude Law (just *swoon*-- he's so gorgeous and handsome, coupled with the loveliest personality), and Johnny Depp!

Also, I've developed such a thing for the guy who plays Cedric in Harry Potter and the GOF! He's also just been cast as Edward in Twlight... he's just so gorgeous! I can't wait to see the film-- partly because I love the book, but partly because I can drool over him for most of them! Robert Pattison I think his name is!

you will find the most perfectly proportioned male, or perfect body is mr arnold, the terminator, the govner, the bodybuilder.

He is a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
 
 
Why is it that straight men seem to find male bodybuilders more attractive than women do?

You need to do the exercises to appreciate how 'perfect' arnold's body is (not in a homosexual way). His body is in perfect proportion, yes there are bigger bodybuilders than him nowadays but noway in such symmetry, and proportion as arnold. his perfectly chicelled shoulders is unblieveable... i would kill to have arnold's body back when he was in his prime

Oh I'm not criticising him, I'm just curious, cos in the threads asking which body shape girls prefer very few say they like huge muscles, but it's something guys seem to aspire to. I was just wondering why.

because girls think they're supposed to not like muscle so they pretend not to. Actually they do. Buff blokes always have fit gfs. fact.
 
 
I think body builders are vile, IMO. They look like over steroid pumped cyborgs, not sexy at all. Less muscle is more!
