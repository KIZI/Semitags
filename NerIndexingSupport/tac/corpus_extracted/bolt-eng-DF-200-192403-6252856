I've noticed, that a lot of girls seem to be gravely disappointed in guys of today.

Just wondering, what reasons do you have for your lost faith in the men of today? and why do you believe that every guy you meet will be like the one you have described above?

EDIT: On both the Male and Female threads :

I do not trust most guys/girls: 69%
I do trust most guys/girls : 31%
 
 
Oh shut up
 
 
Small willies.

Are you seriously suggesting that some irrational female people have 'lost faith' in every single one of the ~3.4 billion male people on the planet?
 
 
I've been used/lied to and led on quite a bit. Tbh it was only recently when I met someone new that I realised how bad I actually am.

I used to get upset but now I just withdraw emotionally. Maybe it's because I haven't met the right person. I'm still open to the idea of love but I do have some major trust issues.

Sounds like a female version of me tbh. Instead of emotional withdrawal I just get very very bitter and apathetic. Hell, I'm full of apathy most of the time anyway

Well the ones that didn't reject and embarrass me either cheated, or slept with me then buggered off. It'd be nice to have a positive experience...
 
 
I trust most guys. Most of my friends are guys. Romantically though, I wouldn't trust any of them...they're the kind of guys who drop their house keys down drains. God knows what they'd be like with girlfriends.
 
 
Thats funny....cos ''SHE AIN'T LOST FAITH IN MY WALLET''.....now i ain't saying she's a gold digger!

Girls have very high standards. especially if they are white. they expect you to pamper them constantly, have this job, have that car, and so on. some of them are just cruel to guys. ppl say black girls are rude but white girls are heartless they way they reject guys.

Cool post.

But we're specifically talking about girls that may have been cheated on or lied to etc.
 
 
Starting at the beginning?

- I was physically and emotionally abused, as well as slept with out with my consent sometimes, by a my first 'boyfriend'. He also cheated and lied, repeatedly.

- anyone after that was only for sex and then they buggered off regardless.

- my second real relationship (outwith dating and 'seeing' people) was full of emotional abuse, cheating, lies, he stole £400+ from me and also barely wants anything to do with our son and has said some pretty callous and disgusting things in terms of my son.

All in 4 years, two of those lads lasted 3 years in total. Men, to me right now, are ****.
 
 
I think we all know the answer really. Girls have a strong sexual/lustful attraction to hot, confident badboy types, and even though they say they want a nice guy, most won't settle for one until they want a secure life and a good financial base to have kids.

Secretly they love the drama this causes in their life. The short term pain and hardship is overpowered by that strong sexual/lustful urge.
 
 
Solution : Stop the gf/bf business and get married if you really love each other. Dying while fornicating means you get burnt eternally..

waa? why you quote me?  

...i'm white and i don't give a crap about cars or pampering, though i would love to marry a psychiatrist  ...not for the money but for free therapy, he can do whatever he wants to me as long as my brain is always happy and has unlimited access to antidepressants. That is all.

So because you went for some jerks, all men are ****?
 
 
It's true and it because.
Men want sex.
Women want,Money,Shelter,Sex and most importantly LOVE

Hello imso,

How do you do?
 
 
 
It's true and it because.
Men want sex.
Women want,Money,Shelter,Sex and most importantly LOVE

 

Women expect far too much from men. They are unrealistic in their expectations.
 
 
Because I don't actually go for bad boys (I know, shock horror), but most of the guys I have got with have PRETENDED to be nice, only to be a bad boy in disguise   It is so hard to trust a nice guy when bad guys act like nice guys a lot of the time too. It means you're all tarnished with the same brush, unfortunately  

Granted, my faith is not totally lost, as I have been with some genuinely nice boys   It is all a matter of distinguishing.
 
 
Loool I am so bored of hearing females say 'All men are the same,all men are dogs' etc. Sure,there are definitely some guys out there who are cxnts. They purposely go for nice girls who will treat them well,but they'll normally end up mistreating the female + fxcking her over. But there are also lotsssssss of girls out there,who attract the wrong type of guys (For whatever reason),or they will purposely ignore the nice guys. I've seen it so many times. Then they question why they continuously get their heartbroken.

I wouldn't say I have lost hope in men,but I am extremely wary when a new guy steps into my life (although I try not to show it) When I was younger,I was dumb and naive,but obviously,when you grow up,you learn how to judge others characters,so normally I can tell what a guy is about in the early stages of our 'friendship'. There are plenty of nice guys out there once you open your eyes  
 
 
Some guys are dicks, some guys are awesome, some guys are merely OK. That's pretty much how it has always been and always will be. I think that the majority of these girls who have 'lost faith' in guys either have extremely ineffectual dick-head radars, are actively attracted to dick heads, or are whining about it for attention.

One of my best friends says stuff like "There are no good guys out there, they're all either gay or married" and "guys are all scum". Her dating record reads like a who's who of human crap (Thanks Ross Geller for that line): She's dated a serial cheater with anger and aggression problems who thought it would be funny to try and force her to perform fellatio on his best friend; a wrestler and dad-to-be who left his pregnant fiance for her, and then slept with four girls while they were dating and told all his mates that she's a 'little slapper' and a 'happy little ****', and now she's just started dating a beefy as hell amateur football player. Wonder how that's going to go down. Seriously, if she wasn't attracted to all the absolute scum of the Earth, she'd have a much better life... /rant

I've been messed around a few times/led on by guys who act like they want a relationship with me but actually only wanna get into my pants.
and one of my ex's is just a massive psychopath who played mind games with me for a good year. I would pay good money to never have to look at him again -_-

but, I wouldn't say I've lost faith in guys. I'm single, which is fine by me, because tbh I'd just like a nice guy who isn't gonna mess me around. not necessarily to be my boyfriend or anything, just... someone... if that makes any sense?  
either that or no guy at all, hence why I haven't let myself get involved with 'player' type guys etc, it's just asking to get hurt.

Hear, hear! That's exactly how I feel to be honest   I am actually seeing a guy at the moment who is very nice, we're not in a relationship though.. but I really get you when you say you just want someone who is nice, not necessarily a boyfriend.

You say you've given up posting in your signature yet you've made over 20 posts in the last day.

I honestly do not see why you keep coming back on here. All you do is get abuse. The smart option would be to delete the account and start afresh under a new pseudonym but no, you keep coming back, responding to the criticism in such a way that it makes me believe you like all the negative attention you get.
 
 
Yes I've been messed around before..I won't go into it.

I hate it when people disregard a whole sex because of one jerk. He was one guy by letting him influence all your other relationships you are letting him win. There's someone better out there if you'd give them half a chance

ah, glad I'm not the only one then! It's like, I just want someone nice to be around, without all the complicated official-ness? like, something simple.   I won't try and explain any more but you get what I mean!

No guy wants to be in the friendzone lol

That's like a shoulder to cry on but who you'd never sleep with. Shame on guys who fall for this.

  That's where you are wrong, we're at it like rabbits   He's definitely not friend-zoned, we're just not official

I would reveil the truth about guys. I wouldnt say this in real life because it might jeopardise my chances with the girls i know, but aleast by saying this on tsr it ****s up other peoples game (thats the few guys on tsr who actually got game).

Its simply really, all guys want their dicks wet. Yes its that simply. Ive never come across a guy with a different agenda. Never!!!

Btw what did you think of the latest naruto chapter

no, someone who's nice but not necessarily a boyfriend, who I could also sleep with - is that I meant. Kind of like fwb but a bit more meaningful. Sort of.

Haha - that probably is an understandable suggestion.

Yeah it was epic, Itachi is definitely the epic. Naruto still has a lot to learn, we need a part 3.

Dude Itachi is not just epic, he deserves a statue. He has done more for the village than all the previous hokages. Atleast they should carve his face in the mountains like the previous hokages.

I really liked this chapter because itachi got rid of shisu eye. I didnt like the idea of naruto having a sharigan even if he cannot use it at will. Also itachi is going to stop the impure world resurrection technique does that mean we would see kabuto vs itachi, because that is total epicness although itachi is by far stronger.

Or maybe itachi could fight kabuto's trump card. I think thats the coffin that kabuto used to scare madara into forming an alliance with him. Who could be in that coffin for kabuto to call it his trump card?. Who could scare madara this much
 
 
My last relationship was an abusive load of cr*p. Spent two years being bullied by someone who was suppose to care about me.  

But I haven't lost faith in guys at all.
I've learnt a lot from that relationship and I am a bit more clued up (I'd like to think!) and would be able to spot the signs of a guy who isn't worth my time much quicker than before.

But definitely haven't lost faith. Just because I encountered one b*stard doesn't mean all men are like that.

They're such lame phaggots it's unreal. They'd do well if they all got together and had one massive homosexual orgy.

Anyway, women are very poor judges of character. I don't even know why they stay in relationships where they get beaten, raped and abused, all the while saying "he loves me, he doesn't mean it, he's just had a hard day"
It's nobody's fault but your own ladies.

lol. Silver Arrow spot on.

Why did you stay in that relationship?
 
 
I hate being tarnished with the same brush as a bad guy or just generally being untrusted because of a girls previous bad experiences.

I had it recently, I wanted her to see I wasn't like the usual guy after only one thing and that she meant more to me than that. She even commented on liking me so much because I was not like most guys. But then after a bit of time it's as if she just couldn't believe it. Like it's too good to be true. She knew she was falling for me emotionally but then fears she'd get hurt if it went any further and then ended or something.

I know she's lost faith in guys but when does a girl like that "realise" that not all guys are the same.......

Why do some people have so much baggage   Seems there is no easy way to reassure someone like that either.
 
 
I thought this would be a thread about a hospital.

This, I've lost count of the amount of times I've been introduced to female friend's boyfriends, realised they're a **** within about 30 seconds then 2 months later it's revealed they've slept with 5 other people or whatever.

The problem is girls love the whole confidence thing yet they don't understand if a guy comes up to them and is incredibly smooth talking and confident, he's obviously done it many times before and will do it again.
 
 
Lied to by every boyfriend at one point, cheated on.. current bf is too upset to see me atm but not too upset to see his best friend?

And most of the guys in my family have done something just horrible...
 
 
I have the faith! Maybe because I've only been involved with guys I was already friends with, therefore they are less inclined to screw me over since I'm already a matelet. Also I like to imagine I'm pretty good at sensing when a guy is a player, they have that smug look and look at you like you're a walking vagina. Possibly. Who freaking knows?

There was one unpleasant incident where a sort-of boyfriend tea leafed nearly £200 from me, but he was a little druggy bi*tch so it wasn't massively surprising. Luckily he was so merry on drugs he didn't notice me stealing it back so all's well that ends well. In this incident though, I had no one to blame but myself. He was clearly retarded and bad news.

Woman's intuition is key!
 
 
 
lol. Silver Arrow spot on.

Why did you stay in that relationship?

 

To this day I don't really know. I think a combination of being naive and too forgiving.

The first year it was nothing major and I kept forgiving him and letting it go. I just saw it as minor couples arguments and something that we could work through.
When we moved in together that's when it really got bad and by then I couldn't leave because I didn't actually have anywhere to go.

I'm out now though and moving in to my own place in just over a week  
 
 
 
Girls have very high standards. especially if they are white. they expect you to pamper them constantly, have this job, have that car, and so on. some of them are just cruel to guys. ppl say black girls are rude but white girls are heartless they way they reject guys.

 

no no, we don't expect YOU to have these things, we look for guys that already have all this or potentially will have it. it's natural selection - you go for a mate that stands out with good qualities. We don't benefit from a guys having a great job ourselves BUT this shows that he can put his mind to something, achieve things and be strong in life.

and stop being racist, it's so old now and pathetic

oh dear God lol!
 
 
The girls in this thread are just proving all the guys correct and making themselves look idiotic.
 
 
Obviously trying to hoover up positive rep from heart broken girls.
 
 
I don't have much time for guys anymore. As soon as I started caring, my grades and self-esteem dropped and I got all depressed etc etc
I'm now in upper sixth and I don't really care about guys, most of them are immature or needy. I'd rather study hard now and get into a good uni 'cause whatever relationships people are in before uni, most are going to disintegrate pretty quickly in uni.

This isn't for fun, I need to write about this subject in particular soon so it was worth making a thread.

Results are a little surprising though.

Haha, this is very true. I remember in our late school/early uni days the guys in my group of home friends would almost immediately be able to tell if the new boyfriend one of the girls brought along to something was a dick or not. We'd all be in complete agreement, but all the girls were utterly oblivious. And we were always right.

Maybe men are just better at judging character. Like spacial awareness or using powertools.

I have to agree with this to be honest. The thing is, I don't really think girls are bad judges of character - it's just that they struggle to let a bad guy go once they have him and he knows this. Because they think 'he'll change' or something.
 
 
You can't judge all guys based on previous experiences- if you do, you're not even giving them a chance to prove you wrong and show you that perhaps they are different (it's not impossible!   )
It's natural to become more cynical if your past romantic relationships haven't been exactly wonderful, but it's best to try to ignore these feelings otherwise you could be jeopardising a potential relationship before it's even started.
Of course if the guy does f*** up, then you are perfectly entitled do file him under the "heartless jerk" category   just try not to project any pent up frustration on the poor lad who comes after him!

Oh we are. I have my reasons as well, I'll probably make another thread on it since it's a counter to this one..
 
 
All my past boyfriends have not been very good. I do blame my own judge of character, and considering relationships are a two way thing some of it is probably my fault also. That doesn't mean I think all men are the same, it just means I can't really be bothered taking the risk right now when I've got enough to do.  
 
 
I wouldn't say I trusted "most" guys but I consider myself a good judge of character, and unlike some girls I don't mindlessly throw myself at just anyone who shows some interest.
 
 
personally i think it's all to do with your own personal expectations
if you've been on two dates with someone and in your head you're boyfriend/girlfriend but then he stops calling/goes out with someone else that is not a fault of the guy but a fault of the girl getting two ahead of herself

if you expect too much from someone in the early stages of a relationship then it's not surprising one can think a guy is mistreating her

Actually girls don't do that at all.

They throw themselves at hot guys, who usually have confidence, have a bit of a badboy edge to them, and are good with girls.

Well that's basically what I meant. A fair number of girls are either really bad at telling the difference between a good guy and a dickhead, or they deliberately choose dickheads because they have some weird self-esteem problems or whatever. My point was that I don't do that.  
 
 
^ I really hate that type of guy to be honest, I prefer someone quiet and a bit geeky.

But there's a difference between throwing yourself at any guy who shows interest and throwing yourself at hot, confident guys, regardless of whether they show interest.

There's a theory that girls who had **** father figures (abusive, setting a bad example, didn't live with their mother, cheated etc.) are addicted to guys who treat them like **** too. I'm inclined to agree with this theory. Probably why chav girls with dysfunctional families go for badboys who treat them like ****.
 
 
Better to be safe than sorry  
 
 
I give all guys the same trust I would when meeting a new person, it's only fair.. you can't generalise all males to be untrustworthy.
 
 
I do trust most guys because i trust in my own judgement of character
 
 
 
I trust most guys. Most of my friends are guys. Romantically though, I wouldn't trust any of them...they're the kind of guys who drop their house keys down drains. God knows what they'd be like with girlfriends.

 

I read this quickly and thought it said ' they drop their girlfriends down drains'.   Oh dear.

Please do. I'll look forward to reading it.

A lot of my friends have this sort of lack of trust with lads, I dont really understand it but I guess its all down to personal experiences.

I also think the fact that were all young people here, the people that we know that say they dont trust men are still maturing, still learning new things about themselves and what they want, and maybe insecure about themselves.

Now, obviously Im not saying theyre the reasons but they may be factors. Who knows.
 
 
 
Starting at the beginning?

- I was physically and emotionally abused, as well as slept with out with my consent sometimes, by a my first 'boyfriend'. He also cheated and lied, repeatedly.

- anyone after that was only for sex and then they buggered off regardless.

- my second real relationship (outwith dating and 'seeing' people) was full of emotional abuse, cheating, lies, he stole £400+ from me and also barely wants anything to do with our son and has said some pretty callous and disgusting things in terms of my son.

All in 4 years, two of those lads lasted 3 years in total. Men, to me right now, are ****.

 

To be honest I am biased but please believe me when I say not all men are like that nor do they (as a whole) deserved to be lumped together in one despised group. I freely admit I am not perfect, I have an ex wife with whom I had a child which I see at every possible opportunity at minimum she stays with me every fortnight but we separated for the right reasons and now we get along fine. My life with my second wife has born two children to who I hope I am a good father, me and my wife have been married 13 years and still very much in love. In essence I suppose I am trying to say that not all men are bad but what is more important is that both you and any future partner are content to be yourself with each other and then you will never be unhappy with the person you are with. In a side note both my wife and my ex-wife are the best of friends and regularly meet for coffee and a chat to discuss/moan about.................probably me but I don't mind because life is too short to worry.

Agree. As long as I don't have to hear them whine about it I don't care to be honest but they usually burden everyone else with their relationship troubles and look for sympathy. A girl I know always goes for people who are 'well known' locally for dealing, fighting, etc then posts on facebook looking for sympathy when they cheat because shock horror, it turns out they don't have much in the way of morals.

i am in that category. i am smart (financial lawyer) hot (ex model) and decent. but my dating history, of ALL the guys ive dated are as folows:

- guy who never actually split from his ex gf and instead was cheating and told me he wasnted to sleep with me because he'd "never done a virgin" and " had slept with all races except for a latina so far"
- guy who never stopped sleeping about and pretended to be a virgin so i would sleep with him, he also started dating a real hot hunni while dating me
- guy 3 who "didnt believe it was in mens biology to be monogamous" so we had an open relationship, while he slept about. unfo i found out after 8 months that actually he had a finacee who wasnt aware he was non-monogamous. he told me " she loves me so much that even if she knew i was cheating she would never leave me" which was true - when i told her she said "please dont tell him i know, otherwise he will dump me"
- guy 4 who said he was a 28 year old successful musician who actually was a 40 year old myspace musician, unemplyoed, living with parents, sleepig about with teenagers and eventually moved a girl in with him while dating me and saying he would marry me.
- guy 5 who was grossly immature
- guy 6 who said he was 30 but looked like 50 with a weird weird foot and shoe fetish
- guy 7 who was a famous MARRIED millionaire, who had been married less than a year before cheating constantly on his wife
- guy 8 who i work with, we had been flirting for two years anf fancied each other loads, had very intimate conversations about detailed sexual things, who lied to me repetedly saying eh was single when in fact during that time he had two fiancees and is currently engaged.
- guy 9 who i knew from my prev job, who is engaged to a lovely girl and had just bought a house with her, started dating me saiying he was single.
- guy 10 who called me 'not a proper adult' and made fun of me because i woudlnt have sex with hmi on the second date whenhe didnt even know my last name. he then text me asking if just oral was ok. wtf.

so yeah my opinion of men is pretty low at the mo.

 
Starting at the beginning?

- I was physically and emotionally abused, as well as slept with out with my consent sometimes, by a my first 'boyfriend'. He also cheated and lied, repeatedly.

- anyone after that was only for sex and then they buggered off regardless.

- my second real relationship (outwith dating and 'seeing' people) was full of emotional abuse, cheating, lies, he stole £400+ from me and also barely wants anything to do with our son and has said some pretty callous and disgusting things in terms of my son.

All in 4 years, two of those lads lasted 3 years in total. Men, to me right now, are ****.

 

hunni look at my dating history if it makes you feel better. we women are much storonger than men, who mainly keep their brain in their pants.
 
 
 
i am in that category. i am smart (financial lawyer) hot (ex model) and decent. but my dating history, of ALL the guys ive dated are as folows:

- guy who never actually split from his ex gf and instead was cheating and told me he wasnted to sleep with me because he'd "never done a virgin" and " had slept with all races except for a latina so far"
- guy who never stopped sleeping about and pretended to be a virgin so i would sleep with him, he also started dating a real hot hunni while dating me
- guy 3 who "didnt believe it was in mens biology to be monogamous" so we had an open relationship, while he slept about. unfo i found out after 8 months that actually he had a finacee who wasnt aware he was non-monogamous. he told me " she loves me so much that even if she knew i was cheating she would never leave me" which was true - when i told her she said "please dont tell him i know, otherwise he will dump me"
- guy 4 who said he was a 28 year old successful musician who actually was a 40 year old myspace musician, unemplyoed, living with parents, sleepig about with teenagers and eventually moved a girl in with him while dating me and saying he would marry me.
- guy 5 who was grossly immature
- guy 6 who said he was 30 but looked like 50 with a weird weird foot and shoe fetish
- guy 7 who was a famous MARRIED millionaire, who had been married less than a year before cheating constantly on his wife
- guy 8 who i work with, we had been flirting for two years anf fancied each other loads, had very intimate conversations about detailed sexual things, who lied to me repetedly saying eh was single when in fact during that time he had two fiancees and is currently engaged.

I'm sorry but you must be a ****ing terrible judge of character, the problem isn't men it's you. How you believed a 40 year old was 28 is absolutely beyond me.
 
 
 
personally i think it's all to do with your own personal expectations
if you've been on two dates with someone and in your head you're boyfriend/girlfriend but then he stops calling/goes out with someone else that is not a fault of the guy but a fault of the girl getting two ahead of herself

if you expect too much from someone in the early stages of a relationship then it's not surprising one can think a guy is mistreating her

 

but what if he leads that girl to think they are in a relationship ie they've been close firiends for years, he texts her stuff... a relationship is exclusive when the couple decides it is, not be a number of dates. and once they have that agreement steppping out is cheating.

he should at least tell the other girl he doesnt wanna see her any more rather than leaving her hanging, otherwise one date he is like all mushy cuddling, talking about babies and life plans and the next, he is dating another girl. but the first girl doesnt even know, and is still texting him 'hi hunni how was ur day' and 'hey, tried calling you earlier' totally unaware he has dumped her. meanwhile he is snogging girl number two and saying the exact things he was tellign girl 1 a week ago. but his phone keeps buxzzing and he says 'zomg this girl keeps calling me and texting me....i wonder why' duhhhh

that dude is a moron and a playah

uhhh
a) he was asian so his skin didnt age
b) he had the hot bod and 6 pack and shaved chest of a 17 year old
c) he was a musician with a MYSPACE profile with a bunch of pro shirtless pics
d) he lived with his parents and talked about 'gigs' and 'uni'
e) he was friends with a load of other girls from my school and uni who all thoguht he was 28. all his online profiles said he was 28, even his youtube one.
 
 
 
I've noticed, that a lot of girls seem to be gravely disappointed in guys of today.

Just wondering, what reasons do you have for your lost faith in the men of today? and why do you believe that every guy you meet will be like the one you have described above?

 

woah good one op - look at the poll!!

Oops I didn't realise Asians had the gift of eternal youth. From the sounds of it you've been hit on by the sort of sleazy creeps who try it on with every girl they see, except where most girls spot it immediately and avoid them like the plague you've failed to see it and ended up dating them.

sounds like you're holding a grudge here
if a guy isn't calling you back or replying to your messages then sleeping dogs need to bet let lie
otherwise you look a bit clingy...especially if you double message someone like you're suggesting, it's all about independence
it's your life in which they are merely a guest
 
 
I'm vice versa, a guy who has lost faith in girls. I'm happy to have girls as my mates but I don't want another relationship, they turn crazy quickly.

uhh yeah if you look at asians in their 30s and compare them to white girls/guys in their 30s, they age much less.

and obvv most girls dont spot these creeps right off, i mean look at this thread and poll   fail bro

no this hasnt happened to me, but i can see how it could happen. in my experience, most peopel who claimed a girl is 'stalking them' and 'wont stop texting them' has lead them on in some way and enjoys the attention
 
 
 
I've been messed around a few times/led on by guys who act like they want a relationship with me but actually only wanna get into my pants.
and one of my ex's is just a massive psychopath who played mind games with me for a good year. I would pay good money to never have to look at him again -_-

but, I wouldn't say I've lost faith in guys. I'm single, which is fine by me, because tbh I'd just like a nice guy who isn't gonna mess me around. not necessarily to be my boyfriend or anything, just... someone... if that makes any sense?  
either that or no guy at all, hence why I haven't let myself get involved with 'player' type guys etc, it's just asking to get hurt.  

 

This. Similar to friends with benefit, but not quite, both loyal only to each other - someone to trust or talk to without being judged (where you don't have to keep everything bottled up), not official, just something between you two, almost like a secret unspoken relationship. Can't explain it. But you probably meant something else entirely.

It sounds pretty much like a relationship though. There is a girl i have been dating months who keeps saying very similair things. She got messed around by her ex and wants to stay single. And yet she lets me take her on dates, says she has a really good time. She kisses me, holds my hand. Comes home with me (We had sex once, she has a problem and is getting it sorted, but she is comfortable to sleep in just her knickers). However she still trots out this 'i don't want a relationship' line and i think we pretty much are acting like boyfriend and girlfriend.

Perhaps when her issue is sorted she just wants to be fwb but more, but less than a relationship?

That is actually exactly what I meant.   Like fwb only... more? Like a relationship but, not quite. I kind of wanna say more like my best friend than boyfriend but, more than that too. It's hard to explain haha but you did a pretty good job.

What is the missing thing that makes it not a relationship though (i'm very interested)
 
 
 
What is the missing thing that makes it not a relationship though (i'm very interested)

 

I really don't know tbh. It's difficult to explain.
Whenever I put labels on relationships, that's where it starts to go wrong for me. Like, I've had an experience where I was seeing a guy for months, it went really well but then as soon as he became my official 'boyfriend' it just fell apart entirely and I guess since then I'm just, reluctant to have a boyfriend.  
that and the fact that I want someone who I know is interested in me for more than my looks (not trying to be vain), that's the main reason any of my "relationships" start and I want someone who knows me better before they decide they're interested.
 
 
 
Starting at the beginning?

- I was physically and emotionally abused, as well as slept with out with my consent sometimes, by a my first 'boyfriend'. He also cheated and lied, repeatedly.

- anyone after that was only for sex and then they buggered off regardless.

- my second real relationship (outwith dating and 'seeing' people) was full of emotional abuse, cheating, lies, he stole £400+ from me and also barely wants anything to do with our son and has said some pretty callous and disgusting things in terms of my son.

All in 4 years, two of those lads lasted 3 years in total. Men, to me right now, are ****.

 

You see, this sort of thing makes me sick. Not you, rubix, the way you were treated. I mean, if you and I were around each other and I had genuine feelings for you, I'd have no real way of making you know that I'm not like that, would I?

Slightly offtopic, rubix, but please let me give you a hug some time.

The one difference is, these guys are getting sex, while you're being too nice around women and getting nothing. I'm not saying act like a ****, but just find the middle ground at least.
 
 
The first guy dumped me TWICE. Because he liked another girl.
I lost my virginity to the 2nd guy, he said he really liked me and wanted to go out with me, and that I was beautiful blah blah haha, then I never heard from him again and he told his friends everything.
The 3rd guy used me for sex
Next there was someone who led me on for months, only contacting me when he was drunk
Then there was someone at uni who lived 20 seconds from me, he would ask me to go home with him after nights out then literally blank me when he saw me in the street sober. Then when I saw him drunk again he would act like he hadn't blanked me and say he wants to see me more. Wtf?!
And the latest guy was acting like my boyfriend initially, then asked if it was just a bit of fun?!! And proceeded to treat me like a piece of ****, ignoring, snapping at me etc etc.

The result of a mixture of my naivety and a percentage of men being *****

How do you feel about the way women feel about men in general? [Referring specifically to the responses in this thread]

As she said, men to her right now are ****. So it'd be incredibly hard to tell a girl that you're not like other guys - especially when they hear it all the time from many different men. Even though you might be sincere and genuine, most may feel you have an agenda because of their past experiences.

As much as I don't want to say it, this is true. It's not really about being nice but it's the correlation the word brings with it. Women know that men will say/do almost anything to get with them which is why they're weary of the guys around them.

Yeah, but I'm something of a beginner at this 'game,' to be honest. I don't know... but I'm not altering my personality, or putting on an act. Though to be fair, you've never seen me in person. I'm not as shy as I used to be, and it seems I do know hot to act around women... even if I haven't done that much of it to date.

If everything you've said is true, I'll give up again.
 
 
 
My last relationship was an abusive load of cr*p. Spent two years being bullied by someone who was suppose to care about me.  

But I haven't lost faith in guys at all.
I've learnt a lot from that relationship and I am a bit more clued up (I'd like to think!) and would be able to spot the signs of a guy who isn't worth my time much quicker than before.

But definitely haven't lost faith. Just because I encountered one b*stard doesn't mean all men are like that.

 

What kind of signs are you looking for that would tell you a guy is not worth your time? It seems like at the beginning of most relationships, both the girl and the guy try their very best to please/impress each other and then once they've gotten used to being in their company - the real 'them' starts showing and it goes downhill from then on.
 
 
 
If everything you've said is true, I'll give up again.

 

Hmm there is no need to give up per se. The way I get attention/attraction [and it's not like I do this on purpose] - I just keep myself as busy as possible and don't make myself available at every chance.

Hypothetical situation: If you're doing your work/essay and your phone rings [it's the girl you met the other day] - will you drop your work and talk to her about her problems for a considerable amount of time or will you tell her that unfortunately you're busy/have an important essay to do so you'll have to speak soon another time?

Most people will probably think this is a 'game' but it's not, it's weighing your time between two 'items' based on importance. Sure, maybe it won't increase her attraction towards you - but since that isn't what you're looking for, she might find it nice that you're really focused etc.
 
 
 
You see, this sort of thing makes me sick. Not you, rubix, the way you were treated. I mean, if you and I were around each other and I had genuine feelings for you, I'd have no real way of making you know that I'm not like that, would I?

Slightly offtopic, rubix, but please let me give you a hug some time.

 

It makes me sick too, and yeah in that post I said men are sh*t to me atm, but part of that was again due to the prick who calls himself my sons father doing/saying stuff that day, and the other part was simply because I am in no way, shape or form ready for another relationship. I don't want to be with a man just now in a romatic way full of feelings and emotional attachment.

No, you would have no way of telling/showing me you aren't like that, but when the time is ready for me to get back on the saddle, as it's called, I would just have to take that leap. No one else is going to be able to convince me that someone won't hurt me again and to put my walls down apart from myself. My faith in men just now has been lost and tarnished, I'm not going to lie about that - anyone who knows me, knows this fact! - but faith, like everything lost, can be found again, it just takes time.

Ask me this question in another couple of months - a year and I probably, hopefully (unless I am extremely unfortunate) won't have the same answer because my feelings of hurt (since some are so recent) will not be there.

And aww, why the hug?
 
 
 
i am in that category. i am smart (financial lawyer) hot (ex model) and decent. but my dating history, of ALL the guys ive dated are as folows:

- guy who never actually split from his ex gf and instead was cheating and told me he wasnted to sleep with me because he'd "never done a virgin" and " had slept with all races except for a latina so far"

so yeah my opinion of men is pretty low at the mo.

hunni look at my dating history if it makes you feel better. we women are much storonger than men, who mainly keep their brain in their pants.

 

While I feel for what you've been through over the years, don't you think your judge of character is a little poor? There are all these little signs that girls and guys say to make themselves look more awesome than they actually are and get their partners to have exceedingly high expectations.

Oh, I know about this. The problem is that most of the girls I'm friends with generally text me; if they ring me it means they need to talk to my an hour ago, and it's urgent. I'm not going into detail, but it's happened before, where it was truly urgent and she really did need someone there.

But in your hypothetical situation, I'd most likely say I'll phone up or visit later on, that what I'm doing needs to be done already. I'd never lie, though.
 
 
I haven't lost faith in guys, just in my own ability to pick out decent ones  
 
 
 
I've been used/lied to and led on quite a bit. Tbh it was only recently when I met someone new that I realised how bad I actually am.

I used to get upset but now I just withdraw emotionally. Maybe it's because I haven't met the right person. I'm still open to the idea of love but I do have some major trust issues.

 

You're pretty much a female me   but trust issues run so deep for me I've given up on the whole dating thing, foreveralone.jpg etc.
 
 
Girls never trust on guys  
 
 
Y'all be reading/watching Twilight too much. Men can't operate around women because all we think about is "Don't **** this up, say something sexy and be mysterious~ but we can't because we get a mental block. Since I'm in a women's thread let me give you some advice - Don't say "You're funny/I've heard you're funny tell me a joke" I've had it a few times and damn, It's hard to come back from that, everything goes into shut down.
 
 
It's so easy to cheat. I've never done it, I've come close but that line is so easy to cross, even more so if you're feeling a bit insecure or mad at your partner. I think expectations are too high, it's hard to be perfect. I love my boyfriend but if things ended, I wouldn't want another relationship for a while, no-strings is much easier. Just my tuppence though, I know everyone won't agree  
 
 
  Statements like these have left me with very little faith in men.

 
I think we all know the answer really. Girls have a strong sexual/lustful attraction to hot, confident badboy types, and even though they say they want a nice guy, most won't settle for one until they want a secure life and a good financial base to have kids.

Secretly they love the drama this causes in their life. The short term pain and hardship is overpowered by that strong sexual/lustful urge.

 

 
Women expect far too much from men. They are unrealistic in their expectations.

 

Apparently if a guy sucks in dating he can play the nice guy card. Shy, boring, fat, ugly, average, small d*ck, socially awkward, bald well just play the nice guy card because girls love bad boys.

Who cares if this nice guy also has a strong lustful attraction to beautiful young girls and if he had the chance he'd walk over a plain nice girl to get to the young beauty. Oh no because he doesn't have that chance and girls do because guys just want their d*cks wet let's act like men are nicer and have more realistic standards.  

Oh no don't try to improve yourself because girls have too high standards and it's far too much for a girl to ask that:
she be attracted to the guy (   it's completely unfair for girls to reject based on looks despite the fact that guys approach based on looks)

the guy be confident (   something that every adult should have is just too much to ask in a guy)

the guy have a job & car (   far too much to ask a guy to fulfill what adults at a certain age should)

It seems like there's too many self proclaimed nice guys & asking for a confident attractive guy whose fulfiled the basic developmental stages of adulthood is just asking for too much  
 
 
 
Anyway, women are very poor judges of character.

 

So are men otherwise they would be able to detect which girls would be open to their approaches.

They'd also avoid getting 'friend zoned', played by gold diggers, and used like atms.
 
 
 
The girls in this thread are just proving all the guys correct and making themselves look idiotic.

 

Really?   I have yet to see I girl proclaim she loves bad boys.

Only 1 girl so far by your post of this bs was with bad boys.
 
 
 
Strange. Allot of guys are disappointed with the calibre of women to.

 

Yes they are however I find that most guys disappointment stems from hurt pride & bruised egos from rejections. Basically guys not getting what they want (that hot girl doesn't want me because I'm not hot she's so shallow) or having a girl want a guy whose more than just nice (I have to be more than nice ugh her standards are too high).

While most girls disappointment stems from hurt feelings & broken hearts. Basically girls getting treated like **** by guys they were in relationships with or used by guys.
 
 
 
So are men otherwise they would be able to detect which girls would be open to their approaches.

Pfft shadap. What does being able to detect girls coming on to you have to do with character? Women don't know how to communicate that theyre interested. They just sit there looking stupid expecting people to be able to read their minds and know exactly what they want.
How exactly DO women show they're interested? I've approached girls thinking that they're interested only to get a look of contempt and disdain.

Being friend zoned is something that comes with experience so you can't really judge someone on that; it takes a few tries before you learn how to avoid being put there. As for being played by gold diggers and used as ATMs then that's a no-brainer.
 
 
You need another option?
"I'm a guy and I don't trust any girls"
 
 
 
You need another option?
"I'm a guy and I don't trust any girls"

 

Perhaps the girls you've met, yes. Unless you're writing off an entire gender on the basis that they have vaginas?

Perhaps the girls you've met, yes. Unless you're writing off an entire gender on the basis that they have vaginas?

 

Considering I've met a fair amount, In my eyes I can tarnish all with the same brush?

Same. Thought it was just me...

Tarnish away. But what are your reasons for not trusting them?
In fact, this attitude might just make you more attractive to females in general. Thinking they could be the one to change you etc..

Mainly past experiences

Very true fact, And this does actually happen.
 
 
Right I'm sorry but all the girls complaining about guys buggering off after they've shagged them, a little word of advice: Keep your pants on! Seriously. It's not rocket science.

I'm fortunate in the fact that I'm yet to come across a serious **** of a man. My 3 closest friends are guys, and great ones at that and I have everything I could possibly want in my boyfriend. I've always waited for the right guys to come along (friends of boyfriens)as a serious problem that I've seen a lot of my female friends encounter is that they jump atthe first guy that shows interest, these tend to be the **** & chuck types.
 
 
After reading this thread I feel I don't have a bloody chance now. All the decent sounding birds seem to have just got head****ed by ****ers.

This, the amount of TSR threads where girls complain about getting used and if they'd just taken things a bit slower and kept their pants on for a while the guy would have moved on if he didn't have genuine intentions. Personally, I find the **** and chuck guys quite easy to spot but it's seems a lot of girls have trouble with that.
 
 
 
I've been used/lied to and led on quite a bit. Tbh it was only recently when I met someone new that I realised how bad I actually am.

I used to get upset but now I just withdraw emotionally. Maybe it's because I haven't met the right person. I'm still open to the idea of love but I do have some major trust issues.

 

^ This is bob on. I recently met someone new and I've become a lot better than I used to be. I'm not expecting him to be constantly cheating on me like I was used to and I don't get worried about who he's with or what he's doing which I guess is a good thing.   I used to be trusting until I was given a reason not to, but now unfortunately it's kind of gone the other way around but hopefully that's just temporary.  
 
 
 
Pfft shadap. What does being able to detect girls coming on to you have to do with character? Women don't know how to communicate that theyre interested.

 

Most women do know how to communicate their interest.

Don't relay your experiences with low interest girls as the majority or standard

 
I've approached girls thinking that they're interested only to get a look of contempt and disdain.

 

Exactly my point
 
 
 
I've read this 3 times and still don't understand what you're trying to say.

 

Apparently if a guy sucks in dating he can play the nice guy card. Shy, boring, fat, ugly, average, small d*ck, socially awkward, bald well just play the nice guy card because girls love bad boys.
I'm sick of guys using 'I'm a nice guy' to excuse all or most of their dating troubles because most of the times their issue isn't that they're so nice they're a pushover.

It's usually because they're shy, fat, ugly, bald, socially awkward, and so on.

Who cares if this nice guy also has a strong lustful attraction to beautiful young girls and if he had the chance he'd walk over a plain nice girl to get to the young beauty. Oh no because he doesn't have that chance and girls do because guys just want their d*cks wet let's act like men are nicer and have more realistic standards.  
Sick of guys acting like they have more realistic standards because men's standards aren't more realistic than women. The only difference is guys don't get much opportunity to go after only their most preferred type.

Oh no don't try to improve yourself because girls have too high standards and it's far too much for a girl to ask that:
she be attracted to the guy (   it's completely unfair for girls to reject based on looks despite the fact that guys approach based on looks)
Sick of guys playing the girls standards are too high for guys to excuse not trying self-improvement

the guy be confident (   something that every adult should have is just too much to ask in a guy)
Confidence I laugh when guys act like this is too much to ask for because it's expected in most adults to have a healthy self esteem.

the guy have a job & car (   far too much to ask a guy to fulfill what adults at a certain age should)
Another thing I laugh at when guys whine about it. There comes a point when a job & car is expected of an adult.

It seems like there's too many self proclaimed nice guys & asking for a confident attractive guy whose fulfiled the basic developmental stages of adulthood is just asking for too much  
Guys play the girls love bad boys card too often to excuse their own failings so they can look like victims. When in all honesty it's just that these guys are inept and want the easy way out aka a girl he wants who fits his criteria to like him just as is.
 
 
 
Yes they are however I find that most guys disappointment stems from hurt pride & bruised egos from rejections. Basically guys not getting what they want (that hot girl doesn't want me because I'm not hot she's so shallow) or having a girl want a guy whose more than just nice (I have to be more than nice ugh her standards are too high).

While most girls disappointment stems from hurt feelings & broken hearts. Basically girls getting treated like sh*t by guys they were in relationships with or used by guys.

 

So trivialising guys feelings of disappointment and broken hearts now?

I'll add that to the rap sheet for why some guys find the calibre of women so poor of late.  

I can safely say most of my disappointments with women have involved relationships with them. Rejection is easy, crazy/immature/malice is hard.

It's true that it's very self righteous for someone to put their failures with relationships down to being too 'nice', but if you look at this thread there's plenty of girls who have gone out with complete tools and complained about it when it's their own fault. There's a difference between wanting to go out with someone who's confident in themselves and someone who's just a ****er, and lots of girls in this thread have clearly gone for the latter.
 
 
I noticed one whiney bitch moan about how men do a ton of stuff wrong but let me answer to her (she's the one with italicised made up comments) with my comment.

Lots of blokes are really nice and we do have completely pure ideals BUT we're too lazy to get into shape, to get a job and keep a car going etc. Which is wrong, you wouldn't fancy a girl who was out of shape, chipped nails and greasy hair would you? It's a double standard and lots of us, including myself have previously not realised the need to improve yourself from the basic out look just so we can keep up with the competition. Most people carry the idea "why should i, if she doesn't like me for me..." BUT how is she going to learn more about you, how is she going to get to know you if you don't entise her with one of the necessary aspects of a relationship, a positive physicaly image. How you look denotes how you think!

BUT, this girl has some deluded idea that every boy has the same problem, maybe aside from a couple of people. My presumptive personality leads me to believe that this is because her sorry ass was dumped by a boy who wears denim tops, chinos and a V neck. Just because he can apply fake tan better than you and raid the local Topman it doesn't mean his confidence is good. Lots of girls look backwards and have given up on talking to a guy because he confronted you nicely, you liked the way he looks, so thought you'd delve deeper. No, many girls seem to go looks -> love him.
No specific girls have annoyed me enough to write this angry comment but full of **** girls who dictate the rules that "all men miss" because they had their ass dumped recently annoy me.
Y'know those facebook statuses which pop up bi-weekly "all guys are the same", "what a dick!", "guys only want one thing"; They're literally beginning to help me filter my facebook of silly people. If you pick a dick, don't follow the same strategy and eventually moan because you found another dick. "he's fun in a club, he has a car, him and his mates are 'the lads of the town' and he wears kewl clothes, i'll take him" guess who'll get hurt.

  now thats an argument. Instant win.

Instead of getting all butthurt why don't you tell us HOW women communicate interest?
 
 
I trust some guys, but when it comes to first impressions, I take it with a pinch of salt. (Since, in my experience, guys big themselves up a bit, even if just to friends.)
I was cheated on for 3 months of a 9 month relationship, didn't realise for the first 2, during the last month, I was hoping he'd tell me himself. Nope.

And you've pretty much proved sil3nt_cha0s' point about unrealistic standards here, you criticize men passing plain girls over for attractive ones but then you say you expect a guy to be confident and have a good job and car on top of the usual physical attributes. Kind of hypocritical tbh.
 
 
 
Starting at the beginning?

- I was physically and emotionally abused, as well as slept with out with my consent sometimes, by a my first 'boyfriend'. He also cheated and lied, repeatedly.

- anyone after that was only for sex and then they buggered off regardless.

- my second real relationship (outwith dating and 'seeing' people) was full of emotional abuse, cheating, lies, he stole £400+ from me and also barely wants anything to do with our son and has said some pretty callous and disgusting things in terms of my son.

All in 4 years, two of those lads lasted 3 years in total. Men, to me right now, are ****.

 

 
 
 
Women have horrible taste in men until around their mid 20s, so it's not men they should lose faith in but their ability to pick decent men. You'll all realise this in time.
 
 
Perhaps if they repeatedly stopped going for dickheads their wouldn't be a problem, I mean animals are meant to adapt and learn but it seems to me women just love to get walked all over.
 
 
 
so yeah my opinion of men is pretty low at the mo.

hunni look at my dating history if it makes you feel better. we women are much storonger than men, who mainly keep their brain in their pants.

 

Your whole post reeks of a very weak, shallow-minded woman with zero strength of character.

And your last comment is just incredibly sexist, im glad you think my brain is in my pants.. but rest assured even if it were, you would be the last thing on the planet it would be attracted to. You horrible disastrous little fiend.
 
 
 
nonsensical rambling by a slightly bizarre and obsessive, embittered woman.

 

^^^

I'd also argue that by the time people get into their mid 20s, they generally become more settled and capable of making better decisions. So it's not just the women who perhaps learn from their experiences and become less driven by status anxiety, but also the men who become more experienced and feel more in control of their situation in life ie less likely to act like d*ckheads because it won't wash so well anymore. So it's win-win all round, and why I'm generally sceptical of "serious" relationships pre ~24 years of age.

Totally agree with you.
 
 
Many of the posts remind me of that picture where a girl is talking to a guy about her woes and says, "I wish there were more guys like you out there". He thinks, "Bitch, I'm like me".
 
 
 
You need another option?
"I'm a guy and I don't trust any girls"

 

Haha true, though I made a thread specifically for guys but only 1 person replied.

Isn't this what is happening in this thread this very moment?
 
 
In all fairness, i think i need to calm down given my earlier response and we all can be content in the knowledge that confused naive girls our age, only manage to convince other naive girls that men are all of the above. Smart girls and the male population can clearly see that the only ones acting the way these girls act, are a minor percentage.. a statistic that will always present itself in a population the size of ours.

I think I've become more honest about my feelings. However, I can still be very suspicious and paranoid.  
 
 
 
Y'all be reading/watching Twilight too much. Men can't operate around women because all we think about is "Don't **** this up, say something sexy and be mysterious~ but we can't because we get a mental block. Since I'm in a women's thread let me give you some advice - Don't say "You're funny/I've heard you're funny tell me a joke" I've had it a few times and damn, It's hard to come back from that, everything goes into shut down.

 

How about "You make me laugh"? Guys I've said that too seem to respond rather well to it. And well, most girls I know likes a guy who can make her laugh. Also some guys (Im not going to generalise and say 'all' guys) like a woman who can make him laugh.

Responding to the OP, a lot of girls (including myself) have been lied to by guys. For some girls, it puts them off men for quite a while. And we tar you all with the same brush. Personally, I know there are some really decent guys out there, its just finding the one thats right for me. By no means have I lost faith in guys  
 
 
Guys don't have a clue what they want.
One minute they like you, the next they don't.
One minute they want to be with you the whole night, the next they're 'not sure'.
One minute they're all over you, the next they have a damn girlfriend.

This thread popped up at a very angry period of my life right now.
I've given up.
One good experience with guys is all I'd need to change my opinion and, as of yet, I haven't had one.
 
 
 
Isn't this what is happening in this thread this very moment?

 

this thread is epic op. I thought i was alone in my awful dating history but it seems 3/4 of girls dont trust most guys! Alot of bashing from 'nice guys' aka overweight, inept socially, boring etc dudes. But i think you made a great thread. Out of interest WHY do you think most girls dont trust men nowadays, is it the playah pick up culture? And why do you think there was only 1 reponse to the 'im a guy and dont trust most girls' thread compared to 8 pages of replies to this one?

Thanks, yeah it's been pondering my mind for a very long time now. Girls don't trust guys these days because of what guys have done to them in their previous relationships. I wouldn't really say it's player pick-up tactics as it seems to work on so many girls now its not even funny.

However I think it's incredibly silly for people to judge others in this way. I mean if we said that all black people are dirty - we'd labelled a racist and rightly so, but when we say all guys/girls are bastards/bitches it's somehow ok..

As for the 1 response.. it's just

A) Guys are happy with the way women treat them and they are happy as long as they are getting their sex, nothing else matters.

I actually expected that thread to have more responses.

Ha. Apologies.

I always assumed it was girls who didn't know what they want as what they say they want is different from what they actually want..

As for the hot/cold behaviour; it could be because they're not interested or because they want to appear 'busy' etc any 'games' you might know they play.

You need to judge characters better - yeah it's been said 1000x but it's true. Little things like these are signs that you stay away from those type of guys.
 
 
This is because girls are stupid and they go for the wrong guys. They're all like sheep, no offence intended.

PS. I know that my post wasn't very intelligent, nor was it backed up with any evidence, but I just can't be bothered because no matter what I write, most girls reading this will probably still have their own "thoughts" and "opinions".
 
 
I haven't lost all faith in men. I'm aware that some break the trust that is put in them but it just makes you more cautious about who to trust and to be more careful when trusting someone in the future. Just lessons of life, to be learned by all at some point.
 
 
It could just as easily go the other way; I'm tired of this all "all guys are cheating, lying scum" stereotyping. Personally I've witnessed mostly girls doing the heart-breaking; with all their games, friend-zoning and being generally wishy washy. I do appreciate that I am generalising a lot here, but the girls who stereotype guys like this usually fall into this category. Maybe they should stop blaming the opposite sex and take a good hard look at themselves.

-end of opinionated and generalising post-

"You're funny" is perfect, It appeals the ye old ego of ours. I hope I meet someone like you or similar, head screwed on. That's what we need, will at least give us half a chance.
 
 
 
I think I've become more honest about my feelings. However, I can still be very suspicious and paranoid.  

 

I've found that too. I used to be such a doormat, for everyone. My "friends" of the time abused it loads because they knew I'd feel guilty not doing what they wanted etc but now I say what I think, and not what people want to hear. I did think that it would make me rather unpopular but in actual fact quite a lot of people have said they appreciate the honesty and not many people are like that so it really worked out best for me in the end.   I've found the paranoia have gone down somewhat since I've been with someone who doesn't abuse my trust. Life is good!

Well guys are supposed to (apparently) act interested but not too interested. We can't call all the time but we can't call too little and all that jazz. I would just speak to someone when I wanted to if it was up to me, but there's this amazing invisible code you have to follow so you're not called clingy or seen as not interested.
 
 
I don't trust anybody, regardless of gender...

OK, I have a few select people that I do trust but I really don't trust people....

That might be due to my lovely disorders though.....  
 
 
 
So because you went for some jerks, all men are ****?

 

If we don't base our views and opinions on our experiences, what should we base them on instead?
 
 
I apparently have self-esteem and confidence issues so I don't trust people (regardless of gender, both in terms of friendship/relationship whatever) for quite a while after meeting them, and probably almost never 100%. Like, I don't think I'm particularly attractive or interesting so should someone actually like me my first assumption is that they have some sort of ulterior motive.
I know it's unhealthy, but I can't help it.

They're probably being careful not to look desperate for fear of being friendzoned/being seen as always there and having the girl lose interest.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, guys can't win. If we're all over you, we look clingy and desperate, if we try to keep a little distance we look uninterested.

Oh, and this too.

Basically, girls only need to look at themselves and realise guys have this behaviour because it's essentially forced upon them by girls (guys will naturally deviate towards the things that get girls interested the most).

This. If being super nice and calling girls/spending time with them all the time worked, every guy would be doing it and we wouldn't have the ridiculous pick up artist *******s where you act like as much of a **** as possible and see great results.
 
 
I had a tough time trusting anyone, including myself, for a variety of reasons. I don't trust people instantaneously when I meet them because I think trust has to be earned. I was cheated on, lied to, and generally treated like **** by my ex but I never joined the "I hate men brigade" because I thought it was pointless to. I know from my experiences with friends - I have a few male friends - that not all men are complete *****. If I'd have joined the "I Hate Men brigade" I wouldn't have trusted myself to start a new relationship, which although it's had it's fair share of ups and downs, I wouldn't change for anything. Sometimes it's best to take a lying, cheating, scumbag ex and just look upon it as an experience, rather than the benchpost for all future relationships and friendships.

I agree- however "All the sandwiches I have ever eaten were bad, therefore I beleive that all sandwiches are bad" is closer to what she was saying.

As a guy who's lost faith in women, certainly in any kind of romantic sense with damned good reason, having been mentally abused and cheated on by my exes. I'd say it's not just women who have this issue, members of both sexes have equal ability to lie, cheat on and abuse their partners.

We are conditioned by our own experiences and those of the people around us, men were until recently statistically more likely to cheat on and lie to their partners/girlfriends. If you are a woman and have cheated on and lied to repeatedly as have those arround you, consciously or not you extrapolate those experiences, because your conditioned to response is to view every man as a liar and a cheat.

If you are brought up in a situation where you are conditioned that the only person you can trust and rely upon is yourself, because everyone else will betray you or let you down when you most need them.

To open up to and trust another is exceedingly hard without having them reinforce your pre-existing conditioning, which can very easily cause them to actively avoid romantic entangements, I know this from my own personal experience.

This. If being super nice and calling girls/spending time with them all the time worked, every guy would be doing it and we wouldn't have the ridiculous pick up artist *******s where you act like as much of a **** as possible and see great results.

 

Yet another bad behavior by men is all women's fault  

Guys get great results because pick up artistry is psychological manipulation/mind games and that works on most people. It's a people thing not a gender thing.

But whoa thanks for showing that men are only nice to get laid and get what they want & that there are extremely few genuine acts of kindness in the male gender.  
 
 
 
It's true that it's very self righteous for someone to put their failures with relationships down to being too 'nice', but if you look at this thread there's plenty of girls who have gone out with complete tools and complained about it when it's their own fault. There's a difference between wanting to go out with someone who's confident in themselves and someone who's just a ****er, and lots of girls in this thread have clearly gone for the latter.

 

Yet this but has nothing to do with guy's putting their failures on being too nice.

It's like a few guys dating brunettes so I decide the reason the reason I'm failing is because I'm a blonde.

So how does a girl making a mistake picking a guy allow guys to put their failures on being too nice? It doesn't.

So how does a girl mistaking arrpgance for confidence all allow guys to put their failures on being too nice? It doesn't.

Yet for some reason guys play the victim card because a few girls make a few dating mistakes.
 
 
 
I noticed one whiney bitch moan about how men do a ton of stuff wrong but let me answer to her (she's the one with italicised made up comments) with my comment.

 

Hmm I wonder if I can

This thread is about why you lost faith in men did you expect people to be singing the praises of the male gender  

I have no need for your answer because I wasn't asking you anything.

If you feel the need to be all butthurt threr's a thread for guys titled why you lost faith in women you whiney bitch.

 
[Lots of blokes are really nice and we do have completely pure ideals BUT we're too lazy to get into shape, to get a job and keep a car going etc. Which is wrong, you wouldn't fancy a girl who was out of shape, chipped nails and greasy hair would you? It's a double standard and lots of us, including myself have previously not realised the need to improve yourself from the basic out look just so we can keep up with the competition. Most people carry the idea "why should i, if she doesn't like me for me..." BUT how is she going to learn more about you, how is she going to get to know you if you don't entise her with one of the necessary aspects of a relationship, a positive physicaly image. How you look denotes how you think!

BUT, this girl has some deluded idea that every boy has the same problem, maybe aside from a couple of people. My presumptive personality leads me to believe that this is because her sorry ass was dumped by a boy who wears denim tops, chinos and a V neck. Just because he can apply fake tan better than you and raid the local Topman it doesn't mean his confidence is good. Lots of girls look backwards and have given up on talking to a guy because he confronted you nicely, you liked the way he looks, so thought you'd delve deeper. No, many girls seem to go looks -> love him.
No specific girls have annoyed me enough to write this angry comment but full of **** girls who dictate the rules that "all men miss" because they had their ass dumped recently annoy me.
Y'know those facebook statuses which pop up bi-weekly "all guys are the same", "what a dick!", "guys only want one thing"; They're literally beginning to help me filter my facebook of silly people. If you pick a dick, don't follow the same strategy and eventually moan because you found another dick. "he's fun in a club, he has a car, him and his mates are 'the lads of the town' and he wears kewl clothes, i'll take him" guess who'll get hurt.

  now thats an argument. Instant win.

 

So you think a few bitter comments from women equals an instant win?

Men totally dominate the area of bitterness AND hatred directed at the opposite gender.  

In fact most guys policy is if a guy gets hurt by a woman it's because it's hard to find a good woman but if a girl gets hurt by a guy it's because she likes bad boys/dicks.  

What argument are you talking about?  
 
 
 
Instead of getting all butthurt why don't you tell us HOW women communicate interest?

 

No butthurt from me here.

I guess the fact that you were choosing girls who had no to low interest in you bothered you.

Quite sad you've never met a woman interested enough in you for her to communicate it.

You missed the entire point about pick up artistry. Why do you think it even exists in the first place? Because men are trying to decode women, essentially. Men are simple creatures. Women are complicated creatures. Men have to stoop down to a woman's level in order to satisfy their biological needs and urges.

There are extremely few acts of kindness in the male gender because if men do that, women will just view them as a nice pushover type of guy, and women will just use the guy for whatever she can get.

Men have to find ways of getting laid because women don't put out enough. You have to get involved in sad little game playing, throw money at her, show you're committed in some way yet not get too interested etc. It's just overly complicated and men wouldn't have to do this if women just put out more easily.
 
 
I'm a girl and I do trust most guys. I find guys to be less backstabbing and more straight-up than girls, so I get on with them a lot better. I don't trust most girls tbh because I know how bitchy they can be.
I haven't lost faith in the men of today, not yet anyways...

Ah but i have you see. I've had girls come up to me and literally rub themselves against me, take my hand and lead me away and also danced with me. I've just had no interest in taking things further.

The fact that you can't seem to answer my simple question and keep avoiding it like the plague indicates you're very lonely deep down inside and would kill to have a vagrant show even look at you lovingly.

Bitter suggetss my experiences have left me with a negative view which isn't true. I'm just really tired of seeing girls complain and place blame on anyone but themselves. Granted a minority of men do complain saying that women are interested in bad boys etc. but those people are typically very sour men orrrrrr they play the nice guy card when it's not useable, so to speak.
On the other hand MOST girls not a minority will pop up on facebook after finding out that the boy they met on a night out or on facebook was meeting several girls the same time as her or still having sex with his ex bla bla. Most girls make awwwful decisions when it comes to picking partners and they never grow out of it because they won't accept that they are too blame. They're silly friends only make the situation worse by telling them exactly what they want to hear. I've seen so many girls come out of long term relationships with boys that have cheated on them and hurt them and they'll gladly get back with him or go with boys exactly like him just because of their appearance and/or good personality traits, completely neglecting the overpowering negative traits and the persons past.
 
 
 
I would reveil the truth about guys. I wouldnt say this in real life because it might jeopardise my chances with the girls i know, but aleast by saying this on tsr it ****s up other peoples game (thats the few guys on tsr who actually got game).

Its simply really, all guys want their dicks wet. Yes its that simply. Ive never come across a guy with a different agenda. Never!!!
Btw what did you think of the latest naruto chapter  

 

Girls know and some fear this. This is why a lot of us, we don't like being approached by guys, don't trust guys and are sometimes rude to them.

I'm not a toy, I don't want to be preyed upon because of what's between my legs. I don't like it, so I'm rude and as a result don't trust men. I prefer to date older men inj their late 20s as the younger ones tend to be more indiscrimate with their shagging and see a relationship as restrictive rather than something progressive.

Yeah put out for a few years and then be called sluts afterwards. Maybe some men should stop being unattractive and desperate, that might work  
 
 
 
that's confusing. yes, base it on your experiences but dont be so closed minded is what he is saying..

...i had a bad sandwiche once. ALL sandwiches are bad? doesnt sound right? :P

 

But sometimes, you could have only one or two curries and having not liked them, you declare you don't like curry at all and won't give it a chance. Sometimes there is only one type of curry you like. Doesn't mean all curry is good to you.

I've been told BY MEN that most men are ********s. This is even by my ex boyfriend, who I dont reckon is that good of a person but he tries. Also got told by an older guy that most men aren't great to women.

This is pretty confusing. There are a lot of wolves in sheeps clothing. So much so that I question my judge of character.

Sex is a natural urge and if someone doesn't have it for a long long time, they get desperate.

Unattractive, well, can't really be helped. Guys don't have makeup to improve their looks like girls do.
 
 
I did everything I ever could for my ex girlfriend. I supported her through a lot of emotional problems with her mum and I stopped dating another girl so I could go out with her in the first place. I gave her more than she could ever have wanted (or so I thought).

The lesson I learned is that I should have been more selfish and thought about what I wanted because the moment I needed support she cheated on me.

Thats because they're not judged as much on their looks as girls. For some reason this then makes some guys think they can **** about being fat and unattractive hoping their **** banter will land a gf and when they fail, they start threads on Tsr.  

He can go gym/dress better/get a haircut/use stubble as a cover up/be confident to improve his chances instead of waiting for some girl to "put out".

I thought that too. But in a recent thread on here (cba to dig it up), guys are judged just as much on their looks, but they're also judged a lot on other things too.

"Be confident" is not part of looks. Some people find it seriously hard to put on muscle or their genetics just don't allow for a good looking, muscular body. Dress better - most guys dress pretty similar, there's not the variety of clothes as there is for girls. Jeans, shirt and decent shoes. Most other things make a guy look weird (eg. no one walks around in suits, as much as they look good to a lot of girls). Haircut - fair enough, you can get a better haircut. Stubble - a lot of guys have to wait till their mid 20's for proper stubble growth. Oriental asians (for example) never get stubble growth anyway.

Actually guys can wear makeup.

Or they can care for their skin, get some fashion sense and hit the gym.

I actually can. No avoiding here.

It is funny though that you listed an example of how a girl shows interest but you weren't interested in her. Especially when you previously claimed that women are incapable of showing interest  

No loneliness here & unfortunately I get a lot of lovesick puppies following me about. They do make good entertainment.

I'm still laughing at the contradiction in your posts.

I just love the oh it's only a minority of men that behave that way hile the majority of women behave this way.

Seriously? Thete's plenty of threads all over and even sites dedicated to this. PUA has made millions on this. It's not a minority.

It's just that it shows up in areas besides Facebook.

Funny how you put never accepting blame it seems to be a guy thing as well. Most guys either blame others (guys act like this because of girls) or mimimize/excuse their behavior (it's only a minority)

I've seen plenty of guys put up with bitches because of their looks or the sex. Your point? It's a people thing not a gender thing.

nope they're not. The amount of guys I've seen try to get away with all sorts of crap because they think personality!!!!! is enough. funny how they're all still single.

Who said he has to be muscular? He just doesn't have to be a fat piece of crap or too gaunt and his chances will go up enough to make a difference to his sex/love life. Not every girl can have an hourglass figure due to her genetics... does that mean she shouldnt try to improve?  

There are loads of styles topics for men to choose from so thats a **** excuse. Guess what anyway? Women like the classic clean-cut look on men. Skin can be vastly improved by using the right products if stubble is not an option. If they feel that makes them gay then tough ****, they deserve their acne ridden face.

 
Myth.

 

Prove it if you're so sure.  
 
 
 
"You're funny" is perfect, It appeals the ye old ego of ours. I hope I meet someone like you or similar, head screwed on. That's what we need, will at least give us half a chance.

 

I know if a guy says Im funny it makes my day, theres nothing quite like making someone smile or laugh  
Yeah, you guys are stereo-typed quite a bit. Having said that, girls are. Guys are either described as cheating ****** or girls are described as slutty, so no one can win haha.

Maybe you're right, maybe i'm mixing with the same people over and over.
 
 
 
Prove it if you're so sure.  

 

Just look at Twilight, girls going mental over a **** film because a good looking bloke gets his shirt off in it. I don't think you'd get a reaction like that from men even if the fittest girl ever got her baps out on film.
 
 
I think there's always an initial level of trust or respect given when i don't know someone, and then their actions determine whether that goes up or down. Any other way sounds silly to me.
 
 
 
I just love the excuses guys use for not improving themselves.  

So how does execrise and washing your face equal looking like a phaggot?

 

I highlighted the part where she said "guys can use makeup".

Where the hell did I refer to exercise or washing your face in that?  
 
 
 
Just look at Twilight, girls going mental over a **** film because a good looking bloke gets his shirt off in it. I don't think you'd get a reaction like that from men even if the fittest girl ever got her baps out on film.

 

Ahem. Kelly Brook 3D. How did a 30+ glamour model with no acting skills land a part in such a big film?  

Ahem. Kim Kardashian. 14 million watched her tape on her wedding night alone. Would Kerry Katona get the same response?

Ahem. "Sports" Illustrated, Nuts, Maxim, Zoo. Most womens magazine have a skinny but beautiful actress on the front 10 out of 12 months. Why is Playboy much more popular than Playgirl?

They're going nuts because they want to be with that guy for his looks and character. If he was just an extra **** all would have happened. Thousands of girls like Ron from Harry Potter. Does that mean girls don't care about looks at all?

I said it was a myth men weren't judged as much on their looks as girls, not that it was a myth that men judged on looks. Both genders are as superficial as each other, except girls want looks and then more. You think that ginger prick who plays Ron Weasley would be getting all the attention if he wasn't rich and famous? My arse would he. Same thing with Michael Cera, girls say they love his nerdy awkwardness or whatever but if he wasn't big and famous he'd get overlooked completely. Kelly Brook 3D, I've never even ****ing heard of that, can't have been a big hit like Twilight.

To be fair, I don't wear make up (I'm a guy   ) but my face is still clear.. guys don't need make-up to look good. Just saying.

This reminds me of people on Facebook joining groups like 'all hot men are jerks, all nice men are ugly and all nice, hot men are gay'. It just sounds so arrogant and as if nobody is good enough for you.

It's called Piranha 3D not KB. It came 3rd in the US and 4th overall in the box office and gotten 70+% positive ratings on Metacritic/RotTom. Clearly not a flop if a sequel is coming out soon.  

Men: social status (and then confidence, social proof, looks)
Women: looks (confidence, sluttiness/chastity. nothing else)

If men were judged on looks AND social status as much as women are judged on looks then the Ginge and Cera would still be virgins albeit very rich ones. So if girls demand looks and more why are millions of girls crushing on two very average personality-wise and facially ugly guys?
 
 
 
Of course they don't they're not judged as harshly.

 

They are judged as harshly, it's just girls want to make you believe they aren't. Guys are judged on their looks AND their status, social position, personality, hobbies etc.
 
 
 
personally i think it's all to do with your own personal expectations
if you've been on two dates with someone and in your head you're boyfriend/girlfriend but then he stops calling/goes out with someone else that is not a fault of the guy but a fault of the girl getting two ahead of herself

if you expect too much from someone in the early stages of a relationship then it's not surprising one can think a guy is mistreating her

 

This is very true, but I think (some) guys can be guilty of leading a girl into thinking they'll have a relationship when in reality they're seeing other girls as well. When I was younger I didn't realise this and inevitably got hurt.

At the moment, I see a lot of my female friends get cheated on, used and when you see and hear so much bad stuff about guys on a day to day basis, it's very difficult not to have your faith in them knocked a bit.

I was talking about judged as harshly on looks.

If you want to make the claim they arejust compare how many hot girl/ugly guy vs hot guy/ugly girl couples there are  

So what guys are judged on more than looks. Seems like guys should be grateful after all if girls chose partners like guys just based mostly on looks there'd be a lot more whining from guys then there is now.

I put mostly because most guys judge chastity, her ability to sexually service him, and pleasantness as well.

Most people would prefer a test with 100 questions rather than 1 yes or no question.

Kelly Brook wasn't the focal point of Piranha 3D in the same way that Rpattz and the other one were in Twilight though. Even if you're correct about women valuing looks less than men, how is valuing social status and confidence above all else any more noble or admirable than placing emphasis on the physical? And several girls in this thread have written off nice guys as all being fat, ugly etc which sort of proves my point. If you want a laugh read some of the threads on here about ideal guys, I think you'll find in general, the threads men have made about their ideal woman are far more forgiving and realistic.
 
 
All this misandry helps single out the worthwhile, sane girls. Keep up the good work  
 
 
 
I actually can. No avoiding here.

The point wasn't that valuing any of that was more admirable but that girls value looks in a partner less than men

But once again I applaud how guys try to excuse/minimize their own faults  

Sort of? Now compare that to how many guys get into pua or want to land the hot gir with just their personality. Guys exceeded in that area so your point is not even sort of proven.

Forgiving & realstic in what way?  

Ideal stil doesn't change the notion that guys still value looks more.

"Nice" guys are different from GOOD guys. Nice guys who act nice to hot women (and totally ignore ugly chicks/everyone else in the world) in order to curry sexual favours for that big ass Teddy they bought ARE NOT ****ING NICE. Are you doing this deliberately? Really? When did I say one is better than the other? I'm just saying it as it is. No personal value judgement of mine is in there because frankly I don't really care about what others do. I just dislike it when people talk out of their asses.  

Ok if Kellly Brook isn't convincing... how about that Rosie Huntington Whitely supermodel who is the lead actress in Transformers despite having zero acting credentials?  
 
 
Oh please.

First girlfriend cheated on me, second girlfriend was an ultra jealous violent cow. My uncle recently tried to commit suicide because his wife ran away to Australia with his kids because she was bored.

Women are just as bad, possibly worse.
 
 
the fact that they he will always try and impress his mates with his 'experiences'
 
 
 
Yet you haven't. Bitch please.

 

I haven't beause at first I found you pathetic & sad. After all I was under the impression you were asking this because all the girls you met had no to low interest since you claimed girls can't communicate their interest.

Then I saw no reason because you contradicted yourself providing examples of girls communicating their example.  

Or were those examples just lies you tell yourself to stop your tears of misery?  
 
 
 
I was talking about judged as harshly on looks.

If you want to make the claim they arejust compare how many hot girl/ugly guy vs hot guy/ugly girl couples there are  

So what guys are judged on more than looks. Seems like guys should be grateful after all if girls chose partners like guys just based mostly on looks there'd be a lot more whining from guys then there is now.

I put mostly because most guys judge chastity, her ability to sexually service him, and pleasantness as well.

Most people would prefer a test with 100 questions rather than 1 yes or no question.

 

Let me rephrase what I said because you seem to have misinterpreted something which could never possibly be misinterpreted by any normal person:

Guys are judged as harshly on their looks, it's just girls want to make you believe they aren't. Guys are judged on their looks AND their status, social position, personality, hobbies etc.
 
 
 
All this misandry helps single out the worthwhile, sane girls. Keep up the good work  

 

I've yet to see any misandry.

I've seen some strong subtext of misogyny though.
 
 
 
Oh please.

First girlfriend cheated on me, second girlfriend was an ultra jealous violent cow. My uncle recently tried to commit suicide because his wife ran away to Australia with his kids because she was bored.

Women are just as bad, possibly worse.

 

Nope. Women are JUST as bad as men in terms of fidelity. Not more. Women because they want a superior partner. Men because they want more than one partner at any one time. Anyone who says otherwise without concrete proof is a misogynist/misandrist trying to score dumbass political points. Men aren't noble, women ain't sweet. Deal with it.  

 
The point wasn't that valuing any of that was more admirable but that girls value looks in a partner less than men

But once again I applaud how guys try to excuse/minimize their own faults  

Sort of? Now compare that to how many guys get into pua or want to land the hot gir with just their personality. Guys exceeded in that area so your point is not even sort of proven.

Forgiving & realstic in what way?  

Ideal stil doesn't change the notion that guys still value looks more.

 

+1
 
 
 
Most people would prefer someone who was just a racist than someone who was a racist, homophobe, anti semite and islamophobe.

 

That situation is not really applicable to the dating world unles you were gong for faults thatstrike a person out.

I was going for the fact that guys have more to work with to get a better deal than women. Hence judged on more they can compensate for what they lack in 1 or other areas works with testing because it gives specific scenarios for both genders.

In your scenario members of the both genders can lose out because the deciding factor is faults
 
 
If everyone is so angry about the guys that they have around them then why do you choose them for your company!?

I think we all know that there are plenty of decent, moral guys out there, it's just that you dislike them because they either aren't confident enough or aren't good looking enough.

Actually the real life scenario is that women lead these guys on emotionally and sexually because having someone hopelessly in love with them boosts their confidence.
 
 
Its not that I don't trust them, I've just lost faith in them being able to carry any sort romantic feelings.
Though I can bet its my fault lmao.

Now I see them as a sexable or not sexable meat.

It's so sad : D

ANYHOW - guys are ordinary people. They lie and cheat and are cruel, just like girls who lie, cheat and are being so so cruel.

I've been forced in sex, I've been cheated on as well, but its not because guys do that, it's because that specific son of a bitch does that.

The two go hand in hand in this argument sweetheart.

Strong subtext.

Personally I think you're both right. There are plenty of women that do this and plenty of guys that I've seen doing what the other poster said.
 
 
 
Forgiving & realstic in what way?  

 

Simple statistics, let's say a man's ideal partner is based entirely on physical attractiveness, so <10% of girls match his ideal.

Let's say a girl is slightly more forgiving with looks and around 20% of men are attractive enough for her. Oh but they have to have a car, lets assume 50% of men drive (being young and all), that means in total 10% (0.2*0.5) now match. He has to be confident and have great dress sense and a great job, so lets say 10% giving us a total of 1% of the general population.

The more criteria you take into account the harder it becomes to find someone fulfilling those criteria. Hence, men's standards are more realistic.

Lots of sense here. The problem is when people look at the examples they've encountered in their own life and think that's representative of all women/men.

You keep talking more nonsense in a further bid to avoid the subject at hand. You are utterly clueless.

Bollox. The guy never says he likes the girl to her face until she gets emotionally distraught by something so he can take advantage. Some heartless bitches do it just for ****s and giggles but just like the guys are saying about women who stay with abusive partners: IT'S MOSTLY HIS FAULT FOR HAVING SUCH BAD COMPANY DERP DERP.

But you gentlemen don't like that medicine do you?  

Anyhoo most of the time he's trying to get into her pants buying her crap left and right whilst she is thinking about another guy who isn't a doormat and doesn't need to pay for affection in hard cash. Just a thought.

Exception to that rule right here. I think however, homosexuality might be more suitable for you at this point.

In most cases the guy hasn't even told the girl his feelings so any 'leading on' is really just misreading or hopeful thinking.

That's a good thing  

Sorry about your history  
 
 
tbh girls can be just as bad as guys in relationships. Both genders have equal potential to screw up a relationship in whatever way, and you can't categorise it as women doing it for emotion or men doing it for sex or women wanting a 'superior partner' or men wanting numerous partners. Some men and some women are just horrible people. Men just get more slack for it.  
 
 
I had a boyfriend for 3 years, we split up when I found out he had slept with over 10 girls while with me. Every other guy I have got close to only ever seems to want one thing. I have yet to meet a guy to show me that they aren't all the same :/

What!? I've done this many times before almost immediately after I've realised I like a girl. I wouldn't ask a girl out that is emotionally distraught.

EDIT: I can't read.
 
 
We grew up with Disney, many of us can't help but have high expectations (:
Imagine being told you're getting... jelly and ice cream for pudding but you get given... dates. in a bowl. instead  

I'm kidding, I'm still quite happy with guys myself, but maybe thats ^ how some girls feel? ;D

The more criteria you take into account the harder it becomes to find someone fulfilling those criteria. Hence, men's standards are more realistic.

 

That's sad if attractive confident guys who have a job and can dress themselves are so rare. Then again not surprising since most men try to avoid self improvement & think confidence a trait most adults should have is some difficult skill.

Also the doesn't seem more forgiving but definitely more realistic simply because they only use one criteria.

It's common sense the less requirements you have the more people may fit in.

But what makes it realistic is the specifics of the criteria. After all guys have some pretty high physical standards. It may be hard to find a person of that criteria (slim, pretty, long hair) when you're seeking like most guys are a girl more attractive that you based on pure lack of attraction on her side.

Seems like men lucked out on their dating ooptions while most girls are going to have to take what they can get.
 
 
I know many men who are untrustworthy, but it doesn't make me lose faith in men. My boyfriend is very trustworthy and he's always been honest with me, yes he has made mistakes, but I still trust him 100%. The way I see it, everyone is different and you shouldn't assume all guys are cheating bastards just because you know a few guys who are.

Nope never really seen that except in crap movies. Seen plenty of guys completely humiliated in public though. Also very few people blame women who have abusive partners in reality (and most stats since the mid 90s have consistently shown that women are as abusive as men, they just come out worse when they do get abused because of strength differences. But thats for another thread)

 
 
Anyhoo most of the time he's trying to get into her pants buying her crap left and right whilst she is thinking about another guy who isn't a doormat and doesn't need to pay for affection in hard cash. Just a thought.

 

Yes because men are incapable of love and only care about sex, always. Sexist presumptions.
 
 
 
You keep talking more nonsense in a further bid to avoid the subject at hand. You are utterly clueless.

 

Nonsense.

So you didn't state girls can't communicate their interest?  

So you didn't later give several examples showing girls communicating their interest?  

I'm going to go with those examples were bs and you're pushing this despite prcontradicting yourself because you have no idea how girls express interest because no girl has ever done so with you.
 
 
 
In most cases the guy hasn't even told the girl his feelings so any 'leading on' is really just misreading or hopeful thinking.

 

Same could be said of the girls who think they were used for sex.
 
 
 
This is just really wrong.

 

You're right. Men never do anything wrong, bless their gentle souls.  

kay I'll finally make an on topic post in this thread. On the whole I like men because I haven't ever had an actual issue with them offline but the ONE thing I cannot stand about them in general is their inability to take criticism without getting defensive. Look at them swarming the thread. Go moan about women in one of the other billion anti-vagina threads on TSR but can you not just let us whinge for FIVE MEAGRE SECONDS without you butting in and rationalising everything to suit your own egos.  

Go start your own threads tbh and I wouldn't dream of complaining in there unless you quote me. GTFO gentlemen.

 
Exception to that rule right here. I think however, homosexuality might be more suitable for you at this point.

 

Exhibit A: Male specimen finds threads. Sees criticism. Pulls "you must be a lesbian!   " card.
 
 
 
Girls know and some fear this. This is why a lot of us, we don't like being approached by guys, don't trust guys and are sometimes rude to them.

I'm not a toy, I don't want to be preyed upon because of what's between my legs. I don't like it, so I'm rude and as a result don't trust men. I prefer to date older men inj their late 20s as the younger ones tend to be more indiscrimate with their shagging and see a relationship as restrictive rather than something progressive.

 

Tbh i wouldnt reveil anymore about agenda's in case it backfires.
Anyway even if you date older guys, that doesnt mean they arent in it for regulars.

Anyway most girls are way too naive when it comes to relationships and most of time they will end up getting used or cheated on or whatever.

I always laugh when a 16 year old girl dating an older guy says she is mature enough to handle it.
Although girls might be smarter than guys when it comes to academia, when it comes to relationships guys are way smarter. You might come across the pathetic guy who has been used or cheated on, but in most cases guys come out alot happier
 
 
 
This is just really wrong.

 

Not really plenty of nice guys are friend with the girl they like and when she comes to him as afriend to share her troubles with he takes the time to profess his feelings.

In those cases the guy tells his feelings unlike the whiners who complain about being the shoulder to cry on but never getting laid by their friend who they like. Amusing because they're the shoulder because that's what friends do.  
 
 
 
Yes because men are incapable of love and only care about sex, always. Sexist presumptions.

 

Well this male is obviously incapable of reading because everyone can clearly see that we were specifically referring to "nice guys" and not " every man who ever lived".

Next excuse please.
 
 
 
I apparently have self-esteem and confidence issues so I don't trust people (regardless of gender, both in terms of friendship/relationship whatever) for quite a while after meeting them, and probably almost never 100%. Like, I don't think I'm particularly attractive or interesting so should someone actually like me my first assumption is that they have some sort of ulterior motive.
I know it's unhealthy, but I can't help it.

 

a girl with self-esteem issues, that's probably the most surprising thing ever
 
 
 
Exhibit A: Male specimen finds threads. Sees criticism. Pulls "you must be a lesbian!   " card.

 

You're just reading what you want to there honey (pretty good sign of a neurose). I'm suggesting homosexuality would be a good choice for you, in your current state of mind.

Especially since you're now just treating men as objects to be mocked. Off to the psych ward for you!
 
 
I don't trust them because of the sheer amount of guys who try to cheat on their girlfriends with me, and the poor girls seem to be clueless. (I always say no, totally against cheating.)
But 'cause those girls apear oblivious with their 'perfect' lovey-dovey relationships, it makes me wonder how I'd know if he was cheating?
Also, most of my 'decent', or so I thought, guy mates have cheated at some point or another...
So I just always keep my guard up when I eventually do find a single guy I like.

Duh. Sort of.

In most used for sex cases they have established a romantic relationship while in my xample the guy hasn't established anything but friendship.

If guys really want to get rid of this notion they should uphold the same standards in sex they expect in a partner.

By applauding sexual conquests in one gender & shaming the other you give the notion that sex is something in which a man takes value from a woman.

Also if you applaud conquests how do you think guys without those conquests will be viewed?

All İ know is that İ see plenty of guys who are besotted (in love is kinda strong, yeah) and women manipulating them so they have all the benefits of a boyfriend without any of the responsiblities of being a girlfriend. Call them whatever you want. İm sure what you are describing happens too but personally ive seen few examples.

haha, stupid naive girls  

but tbh, I don't blame those guys. they probably never got any sort of female attention for years, then suddenly they get a girlfriend and other girls start finding them attractive when the guy is taken (because that's what girls are like).

so those guys probably think 'hey, you only live once' and sleep with other girls. why is it your business what anyone else does, unless it's adversely affecting your own life?

Which is while it's alright to trivalize guys feelings.  
 
 
its just from personal experience i've found guys are compulsive liers. they say theyll do something when they have absoloutely no intention of doing it. basic psychological studies have shown guys are more likely to lie for sexual reasons (ie to get you into bed) where as women dont. women dont do it therefore we find it hard to understand it (my theory anyway) and therefore trust them.
Im not saying all guys are liers and that i cant trust guys or all guys are just out there to hurt you and use you, im just saying that guys say and do stuff we just dont understand...

Agree. Girls should just accept most guys are a losing bet in the 'he won't cheat' slot.

Especially since guys look to excuse

I mean look at this post the guys are cheating and their behavior is excused. Of course he must be the victim he probably hadn't gotten any female attention before.

Oh who cares if he's getting it from his gf this is an opportunity.

And girls are supposed to be the attention seekers & the ones who are always looking to upgrade.  

Seems like one more reason to pass on virgin and inexperienced guys.

Intelligent post. I kind of agree. But women are at fault too, because women play a passive role in sexual selection. Not because of sexism but because its much easier for them, this wouldnt be different if we stopped the slut double standard (which is hugely exagerrated, and hardly just propagated by men). They also often act like if you have sex with them you owe them something, again not something i can see women relinqueshing any time soon.

Again, this sort of thing can be avoided by keeping your pants on for a while, someone who's just in it for sex will move on to someone else quickly if their needs aren't met. There are some guys who will say anything to get a girl into bed, but to be honest they are pretty obvious, a girl a few pages back was tricked into bed by a 40 year old who said he was 28, and a guy who claimed to be a millionaire, ****ing LOL.
 
 
 
Agree. Girls should just accept most guys are a losing bet in the 'he won't cheat' slot.

 

Only if guys can accept the same thing about girls, there's so much 'I cheated on my boyfriend' slags on TSR, easily on par with male threads of the same kind.
 
 
 
No, I was referring to that individual case. Way to go misinterpret what I say once again.  

 

I wasn't misintreprting anything in this case because I wasn't intrepreting anything you said in my second sentence.  

I agreed on the stupid naive girls comment because guys are a losing bet in the 'he won't cheat' slot.

The rest of my post intreprets what you said.

This is my own statement that has nothing to do with your post.
Girls should just accept most guys are a losing bet in the 'he won't cheat' slot.

By hey whatever you need to fill that ego

Yep but somehow women are the root of mens bad behavior.  

The fact that it's 'easier' to get sex changes nothing especially since guys can get sex just as easily with hookers. It's mostly guys who encourage this slut standard and needing variety, it being harder for men to get sex, and high sex drives are just the bs backbone.

That acting like you owe them something results from that slut standard treat something like it's a prize people are going to want something in return for it.
 
 
 
Are you seriously suggesting that some irrational female people have 'lost faith' in every single one of the ~3.4 billion male people on the planet?

 

Yes, and many happen to be on TSR.

Men lie about small inconsequential stuff, like pretending you have something important to do but then actually going round to a friends to play CoD. Women lie about big important stuff like, “the babys yours“ etc.

FYI, i have been single for the best part of 5 years - because I'm waiting on a girl to come along with whom I can see myself going the distance (marriage, that is). During these 4.5 years, I unfortunately rejected a stunningly attractive girl because I found our personalities didn't click as much as I would want. Moreover, I've been told I'm physically attractive; and in spite of my many female friends and active social life, I am a virgin at the age of 21 - and that's not down to religion. Again, it's because I haven't yet found the girl I want to lose it to.

My brain is not in my pants; the same can be said for almost all the guys I know. In fact, there happen to be a lot of slags in this world, so if you're going to use that argument you're just being hypocritical. Please don't generalise like that - I actually find it offensive.

  I laugh when I hear girls say this.
 
 
I don't really trust any guys besides my boyfriend and a gay friend of mine. Guys that you see out in clubs who just want to get it on with all the girls there - no respect for them whatsoever.
 
 
 
I've noticed, that a lot of girls seem to be gravely disappointed in guys of today.

Just wondering, what reasons do you have for your lost faith in the men of today? and why do you believe that every guy you meet will be like the one you have described above?

 

i resent them because every straight guy i meet wants to f*** me. every time one comes to introduce himself, comes to talk to me or whatever, nearly every ****in time, it's because they want to do me. and freakin hate that they assume they even possibly COULD. and i hate how i can't go out without guys constantly hitting on me- it's made me cry sometimes because laugh all you want when i say this but it suffocating and feels like harrassement.
 
 
 
Only if guys can accept the same thing about girls, there's so much 'I cheated on my boyfriend' slags on TSR, easily on par with male threads of the same kind.

 

Not the same with girls it's a 60% chance he'll cheat on you. While guys only have a 40% chance of getting cheated on.

So it's more like don't put your all faith in one girl.

well then props to you, i wish there were more guys like that... i agree with everything you say

You talk more **** than a turd salesman. Stop making up stupid statistics.
 
 
 
Again, this sort of thing can be avoided by keeping your pants on for a while, someone who's just in it for sex will move on to someone else quickly if their needs aren't met. There are some guys who will say anything to get a girl into bed, but to be honest they are pretty obvious, a girl a few pages back was tricked into bed by a 40 year old who said he was 28, and a guy who claimed to be a millionaire, ****ing LOL.

 

Actually it could be avoided if guys just stopped lying to get laid.

But of course that's too much to expect out of the male gender.  

And of course when dealing with any bad behavior from men the woman is at fault and must find a way to avoid it.  

No most are not pretty obvious guys can go in for the long haul.

Plus women trust men more than men trust women and invest more feelings in general.
 
 
 
You talk more **** than a turd salesman. Stop making up stupid statistics.

 

That's not a made up stat.

60% of men in relationships cheat and 40% of women do.
 
 
Meh, I don't think women realize how sensitive men are and I think they are awful judges of character a lot of the time.

Then they lose faith as they don't realize they are doing the wrong thing and that they are going for the wrong people.
 
 
Yep but somehow women are the root of mens bad behavior.

The fact that it's 'easier' to get sex changes nothing especially since guys can get sex just as easily with hookers. It's mostly guys who encourage this slut standard and needing variety, it being harder for men to get sex, and high sex drives are just the bs backbone.

That acting like you owe them something results from that slut standard treat something like it's a prize people are going to want something in return for it.

What bad behavoir? Anyway a man who uses prostitutes would be considered a loser and a sleazebag, and still its the same concept - the guy expends resources to get the women to sleep with him.

And I admited that guys are also at fault, the point is you refuse to admit that women are. İs it really hard for you to understand that some women like attention and being treated like special snowflakes because they have a slimey hole?
 
 
 
That's not a made up stat.

^0% of men in relationships cheat and 40% of women do.

 

It clearly isn't from a reputable source or the numbers wouldn't be so conveniently round. Just because you read it in some stupid magazine doesn't mean it's true. If it's a genuine statistic post the source here.
 
 
 
Sounds like you need to get over yourself.

 

Get over herself?

She's feeling harassed?

Oh but of course she must appreciate all this unwanted/univited attention because after all one day she'll be old and guys won't pester and bother her anymore.  

Plus it'd hurt guys fragile egos to think that yes your attention is unwanted so it's much better to think she's just stuck up.  
 
 
 
Plus women trust men more than men trust women and invest more feelings in general.

 

that's interesting,... what in particular do you think men don't trust women about?
i agree we invest more feelings, but i would've thought men trusted women more than we trust them?

Instinctively I think he was right about that but I am now at a loss to explain why I thought that...
 
 
i do know beauty fades hun. by the time i will be too old for men to turn their heads everywhere i go i'll hopefully already have found the love of my life and be happily married to him anyway.
i like the attention when it comes from guys who actually KNOW me. the fact that someone comes up to me and wants to f*** me already, JUST because of what i look like?! how is that not insulting? it's like treating me as if i were a piece of meat.

Most guys have this notion women are soul sucking leeches intent on bleeding guys dry monetarily after they've finished having fun with bad boys & abusing nice guys.

It is.

Just because you don't read much studies in human behavior doesn't mean others don't.  
 
 
 
Really?   I have yet to see I girl proclaim she loves bad boys.

Only 1 girl so far by your post of this bs was with bad boys.

 

Yes, because that's like admitting that shock horror, people like things that are bad for you.

Why do we eat chocolate for instance? Because it gives us a nice chemical kick, as does a bit of drama in a boy.

So you have high evolutionary value and a large choice of mating partners. Boo hoo, sucks to be you. Meanwhile most men (and ugly women I guess) would kill for more attention from the opposite sex.

The slut standard is the bad behavior. I was talking about how applauding one gender & shaming another creates you give the notion that sex is something in which a man takes value from a woman.

Also if you applaud conquests how do you think guys without those conquests will be viewed

Then somehow you add in women are to blame as well because they can have sex easier. " But women are at fault too, because women play a passive role in sexual selection"  

 
And I admited that guys are also at fault, the point is you refuse to admit that women are.

 

How are women at fault because sex is easier for them to get?

I'm not sure how you can place blame for sex being easier for one. That and I've shown ease of sex is just one of the many backbone bs guys use to keep the slut standard alive.

Saying women are at fault because sex is easier for them to get would be like saying men are at fault because they have higher sex drives. Utter nonsense to me.

But if you're really looking to place blame for women getting sex easier that would be on who makes it easier for them- men. It takes two to have sex. It wouldn't be easier for one gender if the other wasn't more willing.

So are you trying to place blame in ease of access to sex on women?

If so how does that mean women play a role in blame on the slut standard creating the notion that sex is something that can devalue a woman & that men without conquests are viewed unfavorably?

 
İs it really hard for you to understand that some women like attention and being treated like special snowflakes because they have a slimey hole?

 

Slimy hole..are you gay?

What does liking attention have anything to do with continuing the slut standard?

Or are you just upset and your failures in dating and hatred of women body parts are coming out?

Once again how does that have anything to do with sex being easier for women to get means that women are to blame for their ease of access and contribute to creating the notion that sex is something that can devalue a woman & that men without conquests are viewed unfavorably?
 
 
 
Nonsense.

So you didn't state girls can't communicate their interest?  

So you didn't later give several examples showing girls communicating their interest?  

I'm going to go with those examples were bs and you're pushing this despite prcontradicting yourself because you have no idea how girls express interest because no girl has ever done so with you.

 

Off to the nuthouse for you. Don't bother with a response as it won't be read.

You do understand what sexual attraction is right? And why men are attracted to women? This is inevitable, but that doesn't mean that every guy doesn't want to be friends.
 
 
 
But sometimes, you could have only one or two curries and having not liked them, you declare you don't like curry at all and won't give it a chance. Sometimes there is only one type of curry you like. Doesn't mean all curry is good to you.

I've been told BY MEN that most men are ********s. This is even by my ex boyfriend, who I dont reckon is that good of a person but he tries. Also got told by an older guy that most men aren't great to women.

This is pretty confusing. There are a lot of wolves in sheeps clothing. So much so that I question my judge of character.

 

i would ammend that to: "alot of guys think about ONE thing". it's true i reckon but there are decent guys out there lol.

Speeling? Slight errors

But okay spelling/grammarnazi you go for the few errors in my posts to make your judgment instead of acyually looking for the information that is pretty easy to find.

Post a link? Sorry I thought it was common knowledge sort of like how there's quite a bit percentage wise of husbands who aren't the fathers of their kids. You can look it up yourself.  
 
 
Yes, women are implicit in keeping the slut double standard going, because they take advantage of the fact it gives them value and power.

Because its like fighting with words. And guys like fighting. Also I think the whole "all guys are dicks" thing gets pretty annoying and repetitive after a while, especially since, as you saıd, really its just people who are scum in general.

I know this won't be read by you but you are a prime example of guys who don't know how to admit their own faults so they act out childishly.

You state girls can't communicate their interest then go on to later give several examples showing girls communicating their interest.

Yet still claim despite your contradiction and me pointing it out that there's no way I can provide examples of how girls communicate their interest.

You throw out childish dismissive statements because I see no reason to provide you an answer to a question you answered yourself in several different ways.

You sir are clearly bsing those 'real life examples' and are just some loner little boy who never had a girl interested in him and want to know how girls do communicate interest.
 
 
So this is the place to prowl for vulnerable women  
 
 
Also how does calling a vagina a slimey hole make me gay or mean I hate women? A penis is just a slab of weird looking tıssue after all, and dont even get me started on ball sacks....
 
 
 
Ah the lack of evidence is evidence itself card.  

 

Yes because girls will readily admit if they have slept with a lot of guys

You know what? You're right. There's an abundance of male *******s out there. Now you can either complain about it for the rest of your solitary life, or you can accept it and find the right guy for you.

But then that might be difficult since you won't know what you want till you see it. Sigh.

Seriously you're going to resort to that because you're too lazy to look up what should be common knowledge.

Are you aware how much more likely a woman is to recieve an STD than give one?

How many husbands are under paternity fraud?

The average age difference in couples?

I'm just curious to see if you're lazy or stupid.
 
 
 
Yes, women are implicit in keeping the slut double standard going, because they take advantage of the fact it gives them value and power.

 

See that's a reason.

Not this women can get sex easier bs.

Except their value & power come from chastity not sleeping around according to the slut standard shaming women who sleep around.

Not a whole lot of chaste women in existence that supports your reason & feminism's 'if men can be sluts so can women' sort of gives your reason less leg to stand on.
 
 
Honestly bitty you are a bit silly thinking that theres one statistic for everything and thats a final undisputable fact. All those things probs have like 50 different answers depending on the survey. Im guessing you study sociology.
 
 
 
Yes because girls will readily admit if they have slept with a lot of guys  

 

Guys will rarely admit to things they're ashamed of either. Does this mean with lack of evidence being evidence & people not admiting what they are ashamed of I can state guys are jerks?  

And how does a lot of guys translate to bad boys or reasons to lose faith in men?

The topic is bad boys stay on that not some tangent that in certain circumstances may apply.

So far only 1 girl at the moment of that post I was referring to had dated a bad boy. But hey if you want to go into doubting & paranoia and filling in the gaps go ahead just don't get upset when girls do the same.

Seems like you filtered out all the posts about men believing the majority of women are heinous.

You've stated that women are also to blame for the slut standard.

First it was ease of sex. Not sure why since saying women are at fault because sex is easier for them to get would be like saying men are at fault because they have higher sex drives. And quite honestly the blame for women getting sex easier would be men's willingness.

Now it's because some are hot? That's just a turnaround of ease of sex.

Hotness doesn't mean power & value in the slut standard but power & value in the ability to have sex.

Power & value in the slut standard comes from women's chastity and mens conquests.

The topic was how are women also to blame for the slut standard applauding sexual conquests in one gender & shaming the other which gives the notion that sex is something in which a man takes value from a woman. And also treat guys wthout those conquests badly.

You're talking about ease and power in sex.

In the slut standard no matter how hot those women will be seen as less than character wise & shamed (cum dumpster, other names).

Also what does feminists appearances have anything to do with this?

I didn't mention the guys point of view because I was directing that comment at you. I'd say the same to the guys going "Oh all women are money grabbing bitches".

You have examined all 3 billion men and come to the conclusion that they're all childish and immature? Believable.

I haven't got an excuse for male behaviour. Other than that behaviour is what makes us male. It's inherent. It will not change (I lie - evolution). It is appalling behaviour, but I would genuinely rather die than have it extinguished. But for some of us, it can be ignored in favour of someone truly special. For many though, they may never ignore it.

It would help if I could plant a positive experience like that in your mind, but I can't, so you'll just have to give it time. Labelling every one of us as bastards though, purely because we weren't born XX, will get you nowhere.
 
 
The importance of a conquest depends firstly on how hot they are, chastity is a secondary concern. Yes if a woman is sleeping with five guys everynight she wont be thought as valuable but thats an extreme, a bit of casual sex isnt seen as a big deal like feminists pretend it is. And who says cumdumpster outside of 4chan?

The appearance thing is valid because if hot girls benefit more from the double standard, they are less likely to complain about it. Ugly girls who dont get showered with gifts and attention might be more inclined to.
 
 
All but one man (who is my granddad) have used or abused me throughout my short life, so obviously, I now expect that to happen with whatever men I meet in the future.

Trust me, I wish that to change. But some things are easier said than done.
 
 
Seems like you've all started diverting from the main issue.

How do hot girls benefit more from the slut double standard? If they sleep around a lot they still got called the same names as an ugly girl who sleeps around.

Their hotness doesn't exclude them from facing the same consequences.

The chaste girl holds the power after all most guys would choose a cute girl with low partners for a wife than a hot girl whose numbers are in the thousands.

Oh who cares what they think. There's plenty of emotionally balanced/intelligent females I can chase instead.

It's just that all this slut talk etc is a waste of time imo if the opponent won't listen.

Because as I said, the value of the conquest depends primarily on how hot they are. As you said, the current dynamics work so that men take value from women, and hot girls have the most value, so they benefit more. Yes as I said chastity is a factor in determining value, but its a secondary one.
 
 
Well, considering how many wizards are from tainted half-blood or dare I say muggle-born backgrounds nowadays, you can't blame a girl for losing faith.

Once again where did I put all in even that generalization. Generalization means the majority not all.

This isn't about male behavior it'sabout men excuse/minimizing their bad behavior and shifting blame onto others. It's not inherent traits.

If you think not taking responsibility for your actions & blaming others is male behavior then all men are childish and immature and not most like I believe.

Actually labeling you all bastards could get me somewhere.

Hot girls have value in sex not in the slut standard.

They don't hold value & power in the slut standard because they still face the same slut standards.

They only hold value in sex so hotness determining the value of the conquest doesn't really place blame on women for continuing the slut standard.

Women aren't continuing the slut standard because they don't get power & value from it based on their attractiveness. Hot sluts & ugly sluts still face the same consequences the conquest value differs but that's has no benefit to them.

Women who are chaste and guys who are successful with women hold the power & value in the slut standard because it shames slutty women and praise slutty men

If the shaming & praising were null hot women will still hold value in sex bevause most guys want sex with hot women.

So attractiveness is power & value in sex appeal not the slut standard.
 
 
There are plenty of good guys out there. There are also a certain amount of misogynists/cheats/losers. I wouldn't say I've lost faith in men, I'd just say that, fortunately, I don't put all my faith in men. I like men a suitable amount, but I don't expect them to move mountains for me.
 
 
I have had pretty good experiences with men, so no, I have not lost faith. It helps that I've been seeing someone new and he is wonderful  ... but even before this, even just after my last break-up, I would not have said I'd lost faith. It's all about having good taste

You're far too sensible for this thread, get out.  
 
 
 
Let me rephrase what I said because you seem to have misinterpreted something which could never possibly be misinterpreted by any normal person:

Guys are judged as harshly on their looks, it's just girls want to make you believe they aren't. Guys are judged on their looks AND their status, social position, personality, hobbies etc.

 

I haven't misintrepeted anything but it seems for you one thing goes in & nothing comes out.  

Guys are not judged as harshly on their looks. Compare how many hot girl/ugly guy couples there are to hot guy/ugly girl couples.

Once again guys should be grateful they're judged on more because they get to build up on areas they lack hence why I put a 1000 question test is better than a 1 question test.

I am curious as to why girls have lost faith based on their own experiences rather than the lacking character in the majority of men today?

You already ****ing replied to this quote pages back, why the **** are you bringing it up again you stupid little feminazi?
 
 
I'm a guy and I'm not really bothered tbh.
 
 
I haven't been in a long-term relationship, and part of the reason for that is lack of trust. I keep thinking that if I don't bring my feelings forward (I have never told a guy I have feelings for him), then he won't be able to screw me over. But feelings arise, whether I tell him or not, so it is either to take the plunge and tell him, hope he feels the same (which I never do) or hide them, suffer silently.

Being in business school and from a wealthy background, I have associated quite a bit with so-called alpha males, spoiled mummy's boys and future business executives. They feel like they can treat women as they please and that they basically deserve it all. Now it's as big a generalisation as any, but a lot of women would agree that for a family guy, you don't go for men in finance. I've been dating rich guys but I never really expected it to go further. They have a bit of that "I have money, I have time, opportunity and will always be forgiven".

Not that I haven't tried other types. The homemaker (who asks how many children I want when we're both 21), the super-religious, the stalker, the party guy, the bore etc. I am one of those who (unfortunately) believe that the "nice guys" aren't as nice as they think, and to a large extent they are just *******s in disguise who don't have the options to screw around. I am after all aware that men under 30 (or sometimes under 40) are hormone bombs who are basically running after anything in a skirt. Some settle for relationship for the sake of regular sex, some put more effort into getting it than others, but it's down to the same. I don't mind "shopping around", but yes ultimately I want a family in, say, 4-5 years and I am not quite sure how that will happen.
I have all those "wife-material" things, I am physically attractive, cultured, educated etc. but I don't have ridiculous requirements for men (usually you have: Kind - handsome - rich - intelligent; pick two. If you are all four yourself, you might score almost three. Never four).

I don't go prowling for bad guys - most intelligent women pass that stage somewhere around late teens to early twenties, depending on experience. But often it's the case that if he's something worth having, he knows it and wants to use it.
 
 
 
....

As for the 1 response.. it's just

A) Guys are happy with the way women treat them and they are happy as long as they are getting their sex, nothing else matters.

You see when i look at my friends 'relationships' and dating, i see:

The girl runs after her guy, cooking him nice foods and bringing them to his workplace, doind really sweet things for him 'just because', remembering anniversaries and special dates, usually if one moves in with the other, its the girl giving up her flat and job to be with the guy. she thinks more often than not, that this guy is The One, starry eyed, she wants to be with him for richer for poorer, and grow old together for all eternity.

Meanwhile, most dudes - what do they input into a relationship? they simply turn up and at most, dont cheat. i dotn see their aspirations on the same lines as the woman, who makes the dude her priority. alot of young dudes main concerns are - is this woman the hottest babe around? if not, can i get her friend? or at least, is she a good enough for now shag better than nothing? he wants a good while of non exclusivity before 'committing to a bf/gf relationship'. also, it is usually the guy who wants to 'sample the wares' and drag his feet to marriage.

this is a stereotype and generalisaation. but why do woman put in so much more than they are getting back?

You've got it completely wrong. Men are the initiators in dating, women are the targets, that's how it's always been and how it is in the animal kingdom as well. If things were as you say they are then we'd have groups of girls going out on the pull and chatting up men, buying them drinks etc, which clearly isn't the case.

Yeah, and earning all the money, sorting out all the finances, doing all the DIY, providing the stability and rational brain in the relationship - none of that is inputting anything into the relationship  

Massive

uhh not really, what, are you in the 1950s?

are you at uni? what exactly do you think all those GIRLS are doing there? getting a degree to get a job to earn money!! in this day and age both genders work. so it doesnt really count as input into a relationship!

and as for DIY, only really comes into play if you are living together, and most young peopels relationships are not.

as for 'providing the rational brain' that is a sexist comment which i am not at all goign to respond to.

facepalm at you!!!!

I think you really need to face facts - when people are young, they're selfish. They get into relationships for their own benefit. Usually it's only the ugly ones who can't afford to be picky and choosy when they're young.

Then once you get older, you begin to look towards settling down with someone you love and stop putting your own needs first.

Seems to me you're in the wrong place. You're on a student forum full of teenagers/early 20's, so they'll fit into the first category. You're 25 and your views highlight you out as a bit of a weirdo, and that's being generous.

im a postgrad, and if observing the fact that women DO and CAN work, and most of the females on here are studying to PLAN A CAREER makes me a weirdo then i'd say the entire female pop on TSR are equally as weird.

and if you think all women are weird and you hate them, you know what that makes you.....

why dont you stick your head back into the sand of 1950s sexism. or more likely, a gay bar.

Obviously you're going to find a larger proportion of girls on here who are planning a proper career. It's a student forum, after all. This site is not representative of girls in the real world, and if a girl is not planning a career and wants the guy to earn all the money, she's not going to admit it here, is she? The ones who ARE planning a career and don't wish to rely on a guy will be the ones who get offended and voice their opinions.

I wasn't referring to your views in your previous post to me. I was referring to your general views which make you a weirdo. Plenty of people will agree that your views are stuck in the Victorian age.

dont worry, maybe if you study hard at school you can BE one of those breadearning dudes and bag yourself a goldigger or two when you finish your A levels.

Other than their weird obsession with skinny men, most TSR girls are hardly different to girls offline at all. That's just something the guys here say whenever they've been cornered or heard something they don't like. Feeble cop out imo.
 
 
Where is the I'm a guy and I don't trust most girls option.
 
 
Give me a break, really.

For all the whiners saying 'oh boys are just so horrible, the way they treat you etc'- you were the ones that went for them. Ignoring the other decent guys because they were 'nice' and 'boring'.

Please forgive me if I have no sympathy.

Yeah sure, all the real world evidence shows girls are gold digging whores who only care about money and status. Deal with it. How many women are prepared to support a man? None. Whenever a woman says “I want a man with direction“ she means money; “I want a man with something going on“ yep, money. “I want an intelligent man“ = a man with a well paying job. Shallow, materialistic, cold, cruel and ruthless - thats the modern British woman.

Men are and always will live their lives almost exclusively for themselves. It has become the very definition of a man - being aspirational, successful and an "earner". Putting gender equality aside for a second, look at the most successful people in the world. A vast majority of them are male, particularly in terms of business, but it applies to a lot of sectors. I assume it's sexist to state that men are naturally more competitive and dedicated than women...but I don't really care, there is masses of evidence for it. It is in our very blood to be competitive and become the "alpha male" (forgive the term...my vocabulary fails me today) in whatever part of society they choose.

Furthermore, those traits are something that women are extremely attracted to. It's a double standard to desire those traits, and then complain that they aren't dedicating enough of themselves to you. Just think about it, would you really be more interested in someone slovenly who will turn their life around to suit your needs, than someone who chases their dreams and brings you along for the ride?
 
 
 
Some guys are dicks, some guys are awesome, some guys are merely OK. That's pretty much how it has always been and always will be. I think that the majority of these girls who have 'lost faith' in guys either have extremely ineffectual dick-head radars, are actively attracted to dick heads, or are whining about it for attention.

One of my best friends says stuff like "There are no good guys out there, they're all either gay or married" and "guys are all scum". Her dating record reads like a who's who of human crap (Thanks Ross Geller for that line): She's dated a serial cheater with anger and aggression problems who thought it would be funny to try and force her to perform fellatio on his best friend; a wrestler and dad-to-be who left his pregnant fiance for her, and then slept with four girls while they were dating and told all his mates that she's a 'little slapper' and a 'happy little ****', and now she's just started dating a beefy as hell amateur football player. Wonder how that's going to go down. Seriously, if she wasn't attracted to all the absolute scum of the Earth, she'd have a much better life... /rant

 

haha, was laughing about your friend, she sounds like a thick ****. But yeh, same applies to women, I mean some are alrigth etc. but there are a lot of gold diggers out there. However, what really grinds my gears is when these stupid women go for men who are renowned for being bad boys and serial cheaters, who seem to be in the minority (I only know 1 friend like that) and then try to change them- its just tragic, like they have nothing better to do with their lives. And it always ends in the same way......in tears, some women are so dumb.

no offence, but you're full of ****, not only do most men set up the relationship by doing all the chatting up/approaching (lets be honest, women barely ever have the balls to chat upa dude) but they also maintain it through sense of humour,entertainment and also financially. Most of the men I know youngish, 30+ are contributing significantly more than the women. A lot of my dad's male friends have worked their asses off so their wives can have a great life as well as their kids and fair enough, the wives have the kids but made no effort after to resurrect their careers and doss around and go shopping etc. Most men in relationships are the ones keeping the women happy, entertained and tbh, most of the men I know cook more than women so that disproves you on that count as well. Oh yeh and I knowhave heard of a lot of women who have lef thteir husband once they have lost their money even if it wasn't their fault so without men, women would be ****ed!

There is a separate thread for that.. but it died very quickly.. seems like the guys weren't interested in that one

This is very true. My dad knows a guy who lost pretty much all this money through making bad business decisions/stock market decisions. Once the woman knew this, she left him. There are tonnes of women out there who are golddiggers, but once that money disappears, they'll leave the guy.

Edit: And the cooking point is also true. Although this isn't a relationship situation, I knew a house with 3 guys, 1 girl last year (was friends with one of the guys). The girl barely ever cooked - she just ate microwave meals, pizzas and ordered at least a couple of takeaways a week. Meanwhile the guys would cook their meals from scratch and they created some really delicious meals. I get the feeling female students are a lot more lazy than guys when it comes to cooking, even though the stereotype is for women to be great cooks.
