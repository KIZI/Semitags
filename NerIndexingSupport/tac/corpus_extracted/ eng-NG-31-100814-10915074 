Declaration of Independence:

".....He (King George III) has excited domestic insurrection amongst us,
and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the
merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an
undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions....."

Said "Indian Savages": "Hey, we were only defending ourselves!".

The "Indian Savages" plan to file suit against the Continental Congress
for defamation of character.
