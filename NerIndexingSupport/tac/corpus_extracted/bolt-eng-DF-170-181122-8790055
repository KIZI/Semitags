Watch the Tigers on ESPN, judge for yourself.
 
 
That ump better feel like an ass when he watches the replay.
 
 
Where is the link?
 
 
That is huge. Would of been a perfect game otherwise.

All I can say is...
 
 
I like Galarraga's response...he just smiled...no arguing or pouting.

Really classy.
 
 
I initially thought it was close. After a few more viewings I think he was clearly out.
 
 
 
Where is the link?

 

I watched it live, and the replay was from several different angles. To me, it looked like the throw beat the runner on one replay by a full stride.

The only question I had was: Did he bobble the ball?

I couldn't tell from the replay that I saw on MLB.com, but it looked like there was some glove movement that might have been bobbling.

I'd need to see the front side of the replay.
 
 
Rule #1 - Umpires are never wrong.
Rule #2 - When in doubt, refer to Rule #1.

Liberals don't care about Detroit?  
 
 
That was a horrible call at any point in any game.

The fact that it happened on what should've been the final out of a perfect game (a record setting third this season), is both too lame and too damn funny for words.

The ump has already fallen on his sword.
