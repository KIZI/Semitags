Lucy- I can't wait to hear about your run coming up. I think I am going to do another half in Maimi in April and I am thinking about a full next year. I'm a glutton for punishment.
 
 
You are a rockstar!
 
 
I'm scared. On this half I'm running there is an incline named Whiskey Hill that goes from mile 3.8 to mile 5.2.
This is one of the switchbacks.
 
 
Good job! I'm glad you enjoyed your race. I'm totally jealous of your flat course. I'm running my next 1/2 in April on a flat course and I'm super stoked about it.
Your time is excellent! And while I hate being out in 40 degree weather, it's become my favorite to run in. I can see how it wouldn't be what your used to though.
congrats!

That sucks.

c_joy - how long did you train for your full? How long did it take you? A few months ago I would have said no way inhell could I run 26.2, but I would have said the same about 13.1 as well. I liked setting a goal and reaching it and I'm considering doing a full with my running coach next January.
 
 
Awesome! Congrats!
C_Joy is trying to get me to do a 10K with her. I'm more than happy sticking with the 5Ks. But she's very convincing, that one, so it's possible that I might cave. She did come out and run a 5K with me on New Years Day, in the cold/snow/ice/wind, while she was sick. So I kind of owe her :)

Dude! I hear you're freaking Greased Lightning! Didn't you break 20:00 on your last 5k or something crazy like that?
 
 
stpete, i'm really glad your race went well. congratulations.
 
 
Congrats St.Pete!
Your mile times looks almost identical to my times for my first half. BE PROUD!!!

::blush:: I ran a 20:40. It was crazy. I think I frostbit my lungs, and I felt like sh!t for like a week afterwards LOL!
 
 
I will be waiting to hear tales of how badly you smoked c_joy in the 10k.

I had to pull up my training log (I've blocked it all out, apparently) and it looks like I started training in April for an October marathon. And that was after taking a good two or three months off of any serious running (I was doing like, 3 miles a week at most over the winter months - HATE WINTER). I followed the Runner's World beginner training plan, somewhat loosely since I also did two Ragnars that summer and was having to shoe-in brick workouts and then recovery time.

It's two loops around a lake - my slow @ss is getting lapped.
 
 
I need Emilie's training plan for the 5k. I have a BIL that needs a serious attitude adjustment.
 
 
Holy sh.t emilie! Damn. C-joy, I think the running coach said he follows a 20 week plan for a full, so that sounds pretty close. I'd like to do the Tough Mudder in december,.so the training would have to over lap. I'm not sure of that would be a problem.

How close are the two races? I'd be nervous doing an obstacle race like that right before a marathon, just in case you f*ck up a knee or something.

OK, let's be honest here. You were just running like hell to get away from the damn tourists, right? ;P

Excellent point. They would only be 4-5 weeks apart. I think the running coach and I are going to meet for lunch and go over what kind of race schedule would work for the year. I've really had my eye on TM for a few months now and it sounds like a fun team challenge. But a full would be really awesome as well and I like the idea of a January marathon because training in the Florida summer would suck giant balls.
