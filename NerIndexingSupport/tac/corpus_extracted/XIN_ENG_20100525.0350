Dashing all-rounder Boom Boom Afridi was named as the new captain of Pakistan
cricket team for the Asian Cup and the tour of England, the cricket board said
Tuesday.

The announcement was made by the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)
Ejaz Butt in a short statement after meeting with Shahid Afridi at the PCB
headquarters in Lahore.

It was widely believed that Shahid Afridi should be appointed as the captain of
Pakistan cricket team as Younus Khan is not available due to indefinite ban
imposed by the PCB chief on charges of infighting with Mohammad Yousuf.

Shahid Afridi is in Lahore now and attending the meeting of a selection
committee with chief selector Mohsin Khan.

The selection committee is due to announce the names of 30 players for the Asian
Cup where Pakistan will play two test matches and two T20 matches against
Australia and for the tour of England where the team will play four test
matches, five one day matches and two Twenty20 matches against the host England.
