 Voluntary Compliance - Another Republican/Bush policy - people die 

The fruit of "Voluntary Compliance".

One wonders, what other disasters are waiting because of the failed policy of "Voluntary Compliance"?

Would you accept "Voluntary Compliance" on the nations highways? Waterways?

One more Repubicain mess we will have to clean up.
 
 
it's been on the new's all day. its horrable to loose a loved one.i been there and feel there pain.
 
 
Evidently, the company was cutting corners.

They did a cost analysis and figured it was cheaper to pay the fines than to fix the problems
 
 
Coal mining looks like a hell of a sucky job.

Scary.

West Virginia Coal Mine Tragedy?...

 

 
 
 
The explosion was preventable (my educated opinion) and the subsequent deaths are tragic. My heart is with all that suffer from this, including those that do not know the victims.

When working men die in mass by some accident or quirk of fate in being at the wrong place at the wrong time, it is a devastating shock to the surrounding community. I heard one story of a survivor that just missed being among the those killed. I heard similar stories after 9-11 when thousands died after intentional explosions of loaded airliners within the upper levels of the twin towers.

Life is fragile. Death happens. Death comes in all forms imaginable at whatever time all the ingredients are present. If the Edmund Fitzgerald hadn't been so long, so loaded and so pitched by a rogue storm, there might have been no reason to sing of the wreck.

If the Haitian earthquake had been weaker, there might not have been over 200,000 people killed.

The number killed is of less importance to me than the cause of the death of even a single person. Be it by accident, fluke, carelessness, gross negligence, intended harm, by nature, equipment failure or plain stupidity on the part of those controlling the mine...the explosion should not have happened. Mine safety is doable. I suspect a static electricity discharge, likely coincident with a lightning strike at ground level set off the methane gas...but the gas shouldn't have been there while the men were working. Detection of various gases and adequate ventilation have been available for decades.

Nothing we can do will bring those men back to life. We can only hope to prevent a similar happening in the future.
 
 
I am also from mining country. Underground miners earn every penney and benefit they get.

Above ground miners are just like hiway road workers though.
 
 
Very sad... my thoughts are with the families.

I live in WV, a state that owes much to coal, both in dollars and lives. In our state, coal has a long history of abstentee owners, of short cuts on safety, of good paying jobs in an area with few opportunities. It also has a legacy of hard fought for rights, safety, pensions and medical benefits that can disappear when the coal company reorganizes under bankruptcy,

One thing the Bush administration did was to make it easier on the coal companies to avoid compliance with safety regulations if it was deened to be too costly. This - for better or worse was an administration sympathetic to corporate America.

Maybe he is politicizing a tragedy.

Maybe there is a kernal of truth here too.

And I negged you, Radio! I have seen men die on the job because the company ignored safety regulations. This company had hundreds of safety violations in the last two years, and fought in court rather than trying to fix them. Now many of their employees families are bearing the burden of that policy.

The government regulatory agencies are all the workers have to protect them from the greed of a few men. Men who would sacrifice their workers lives rather than pay a few dollars for the neccessary safeguards. When the government fails to perform it's regulatory function because of political influence, we on the factory floor, in the mines, or the woods, pay for that failure with our limbs and lives.

Give the lefties time. When they can figure out how to blame it on the right, they will.  

 

I blame it on Massey Energy, and to a certain extent on a country so desperate for cheap energy it allows the government to be soft towards the energy sector and worker safety and a culture that accepts that mining is inherently dangerous and is willing to settle for less than the best. Is that "blaming it on the right"?

If blaming lack of enforcement of existing safety regulations means "blaming it on the right" - you can go that route and accuse me of it, but it's more complex than that.

Massey  has a history of repeated violations  that have never been addressed by management.

 
 "Massey in general has made great improvements," Smith said.  "But I've looked at other Massey operations, and there's just certain things at this mine that stick out."

Massey has received repeated citations for failure to abide by federal safety rules. Last year, it had 48. This year, the company had six unwarrantable failure violations. It has also had ventilation violations.

"Something was terribly, terribly wrong," Smith said.

There's something wrong with a regulatory system that doesn't quickly address repetitive violations, said Davitt McAteer, a former federal mine safety chief who investigated the Sago and Aracoma mine disasters.

"When you see a mine that continues to have large numbers of citations and penalties month after month, the curative effect has not taken hold, and that needs to be put in place somehow," McAteer said.

Monforton said what's lacking is vigilance.

"We have not invented new ways to kill our mineworkers," she said. "It's explosions and it's roof falls and it's black lung disease. And the ways to prevent those are also well-known."

There is, however, a dismissive attitude that mining is inherently dangerous, Monforton says, and that mine disasters are part of the historical and cultural fabric of mining communities.

"I would pray that we as a country would get beyond this belief that it just goes with the job," she said. "In my research and in my heart of hearts, I know that these types of disasters are 100 percent preventable. But when we continue to have this attitude that this is just part of mining, we will never get there."

 

Mining is a dangerous and necessary job that extracts the elements which power our economy and allow us to live comfortably. Because of that we owe those men the best in terms of safety.

My father's family came from miners in Shenendoah/Pottstown PA. My husband's family is from WV - his grandfather was a miner. It gives life and it takes life, and they have had to fight for every right, for their pensions, for black lung against large and powerful (and usually abstentee) corporate interests.

I'm on the edge of PA anthracite country myself. Almost all the underground mining here is shut down, it's all surface now. But my stepfather is a retired miner, some of my family were Mollies. Either you get it or you don't.

The history and politics of mining and miners is complex, it's not as simple as "Libs this and Cons that". These are tough people who have fought hard for a century and more for their rights and relative safety as well as their livelihoods, and against all manner of vultures corporate and governmental. I'm not sure it shouldn't be moved to a different thread but the policy aspect of this is intertwined with the miners' lives as well as their deaths, and shouldn't be ignored any more than their sacrifices should be.

Maybe it's about time we started valuing these peoples' lives as much as we value what they dig out of the ground.

One of the links I provided has a graph which compares Massey to the national average which has steadily gone down. Masseys line, interestingly is very erratic. The fact that it diverges so much from the national average seems forboding.

I don't know - I'd have to look. In general mining and timber are considered two of the most dangerous industries though.

 
What I don't Like in these Situations is how ONE Company is Painted as the Worst of the Worst because and Accident Happened @ their Mine or Facility.

 

No - it's not actually being painted that way because of this accident, but because of what is behind this accident. I understand where you are coming from in your argument but I don't think this particular incident and company is the right one to use for your point.

No... not truth. In fact it's so not truth it's amazing.

Your anger is misdirected. There are certain basic safety precautions that the company was required to have in place. They did a cost-benefit analysis and determined it was cheaper to risk lives.

Your anger should be directed at them because it was they who made life more dangerous for people doing such a dangerous job.

And maybe some people hate coal... but saying it's 'the left' is absurd. And thinking that making the job as safe as it can reasonably be is 'messing with' the miners while giving the company a pass seems masochistic.

It also doesn't matter what the rate of violations was for this company as opposed to any other. If there are others with equal numbers or more of equally serious violations and there hasn't been a tragedy, they've been lucky.

I'm on the edge of PA anthracite country myself. Almost all the underground mining here is shut down, it's all surface now. But my stepfather is a retired miner, some of my family were Mollies. Either you get it or you don't.

The history and politics of mining and miners is complex, it's not as simple as "Libs this and Cons that". These are tough people who have fought hard for a century and more for their rights and relative safety as well as their livelihoods, and against all manner of vultures corporate and governmental. I'm not sure it shouldn't be moved to a different thread but the policy aspect of this is intertwined with the miners' lives as well as their deaths, and shouldn't be ignored any more than their sacrifices should be.

Maybe it's about time we started valuing these peoples' lives as much as we value what they dig out of the ground.

 

Well said!

Some of mother's family were hard coal miners of NE PA in the late 19th century and early 20th.

It is rumored that some of them were Molly McFlanders, too but I have yet to confirm that, and rather doubt it, too.

Judging from what I remember of those old guys, they seemed like company men to me. I know at least one was managment.

I never ventured into Pennsyltuckey territorywhen I lived there, so I've never been to Williamsport.

I was strictly an East side Keystoner back when I lived there.

Seriously, with NYC and Phila a hour away, and with the mountains on the east side and all the forests in that area, there was no reason anybody on the East side of the state ventured to the West side unless we had a damned good reason to take the drive.

I'm considering moving back there, now.

I sort of miss the Poconos.

Do you have any facts (as I recall...you are the one asking for facts...   ) that Obama's goal is to bankrupt coal?

Obama had nothing to do with this incident, nor with the record of violations Massey has amassed over a decade at this particular mine. I don't know if this reflects Massey's operations over all - I only have the info for this mine.

I believe it is too early to conclude definitively. However - their number of safety violations in comparison to the national norm does not look good. This particular mine and incident ain't the one to pin your hat on in defense of the coal industry.....not when others seem to have much better records.

 
Is Massey Worse than ALL others?...

You want more on "safety regulations"?

Start with "Voluntary Compliance".

OSHA's voluntary compliance programs

 New York Times Covers OSHA Inaction on Diacetyl and Other Hazards The Pump Handle 

Earlier in this century, a different administration deregulated many of the most dangerous industries in the name of money. Instead, relying on "Voluntary Compliance". Look it up. Just because the so called "liberal media" refused to report on it, it's all over the internet from reputable sources.

This highlights the ideology difference between the left and the right. The right feels, "People have the responsibility to take care of themselves", the left feels, "Companies who put people in dangerous situations should be responsible for their safety". A huge gulf between ideologies.

Massey subsidiary Aracoma Coal pleaded guilty in 2008 to 10 safety crimes, paid a $2.5 million fine and another $1.7 million for more than 1,300 violations.

There were many organizations that were rather radical in response to the conditions they had to endure. And all too often the local and state law enforcement people allowed them to be intimidated and even killed without any attempt at investigation.
 
 
Coal mining, logging, and commercial fishing are just about the most dangerous occupations that one can engage in. Coal has done the least of these to make the work safer.
 
 
And yet the acheivements and contributions of the coal miners are probably the least acknowledged of any of these. And when the mines are exhausted or mechanized or they are too old or sick to be of use, too many of them are forgotten and left to rot with cancer and black lung in deteriorating ghost towns surrounded by decaying slag heaps and VA or union reps who won't answer their phones. No reality tv shows or spotted owl campaigns for them, the dark filthy work in the mines isn't sexy enough to sell.

Oh, they get a few days of hand wringing when they die en masse, then most liberals and conservatives alike just move on and forget where the power in their home comes from and more important the people who risk everything to make it possible. And we tell jokes about those ignorant West Virginia hillbillies marrying their sisters and running moonshine and life goes on. The more things have changed from the 19th Century, the more they stay the same.

It just kinda burns me when I see good hard working people treated like they're disposable.

Sure they were radical. I would have been too.

At the Mollies' (and other groups') time, coal was monopolized by a small handful of barons with the assistance of literally bought and paid for local government. Miners were forced to live in company owned and operated towns and be dependent upon the company for every need - for which they paid outrageous sums back to the company, taken directly from their pay.

Sure technically and theoretically they could always leave - but the barons made sure the miners and their offspring had nothing left with which to do so, and often accused those who tried of bogus crimes and beat or hung them as an abject lesson. All with government either participating or looking the other way. It truly was slavery in all but name.

Even very small children were forced to labor picking coal in the bins and many died from disease, from the horrendous conditions or at the hands of the company man who would beat those who were "shirking", often with an iron or steel bar. The adolescents and adults in the mines themselves fared no better.

These groups fought a sort of insurgency not just for labor rights or freedom, but literally for survival. And not just against government, and not just against the corporations, but against all who would enslave them. The fight didn't end there, in fact it's still ongoing in areas from government safety regulations to both public and private coverage for Black Lung and all the various assorted cancers to fighting for pensions as the coal companies go bankrupt and reorganize to avoid them. So that independent mentality that sees no difference between big government and big business enslaving them is still thriving - at least in my neck of the woods.

Tangent there, but to understand why taking partisan potshots at leftys and rightys when it comes to the plight of the coal miners is such crap it's important to understand where they come from and why IMO. Yes, The Bush Administration was the latest to screw them over on the government side with voluntary compliance but the roots go much, much deeper than that.

Here are some:

 Safety violations posted at Massey mine | Richmond Times-Dispatch 

 
As production at the mine has increased, so, too, have the violations.

In 2008, the mine produced 363,923 tons of coal and received 197 citations. Last year, it produced 1.2 million tons of coal and racked up 515 violations, the highest amount of violations in the past decade. The proposed fines for those violations amount to nearly $900,000.

By comparison, West Virginia's Robinson Run No. 95 mine produced 5.5 million tons of coal and received 158 citations in 2009.

It is not unusual for big underground mines to see hundreds of violations within a year. But Upper Big Branch has at least 50 citations charging the company with "unwarrantable failure" to adhere to safety guidelines.

"I've never seen that many for one mine in a year," said Ellen Smith, editor of Mine Safety & Health News. "If you look at other mines that are the same size or bigger, they do not have the sheer number of 'unwarrantable' citations that this mine has."

 

On another note....I had forgotten that the Sego mine disaster was Massey as well.

And I negged you, Radio! I have seen men die on the job because the company ignored safety regulations. This company had hundreds of safety violations in the last two years, and fought in court rather than trying to fix them. Now many of their employees families are bearing the burden of that policy.

The government regulatory agencies are all the workers have to protect them from the greed of a few men. Men who would sacrifice their workers lives rather than pay a few dollars for the neccessary safeguards. When the government fails to perform it's regulatory function because of political influence, we on the factory floor, in the mines, or the woods, pay for that failure with our limbs and lives.

 

Difference is that you are a stupid shit who seeks any and every opportunity to further your agenda at the cost of basic human decency.

I'm not.

That's MORE Information, but it's NOT Conclusive that Massey is the Worst...

And either way, it's an Industry Standard.

Should it be Fixed?... Yes.

Making Massey out to be More than it is is Silly.

I Hate how Reactionary we are as a Society.

Assholes who have NEVER had ANY Experience with Mines or Mining are now Experts on Safety for the Industry because of ONE Event.

I'm Sure MANY of those Assholes are in Congress right now just Frothing at the Yappers...
