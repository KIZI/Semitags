Everton Infested with Bitters........they start on Kipper, and when they
'grow up' arf...they come on here obsessing about Liverpool FC, angry at
growing up, not seeing NEVERton drive an open topped bus down Queens
Drive with some Silver, so they live to deride the Mighty REDS....a
Liverpool loss is an everton victory...even if they've lost
themselves.......tonight, the slide starts at City...this team will run
you ragged......

POST OF THE WEEK TBH.
