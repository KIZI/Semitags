Despite the declining ranking at international level, Pakistan Squash Federation
(PSF) showed its hope to win the gold medal in the 16th Asian Games, officials
told Xinhua on Thursday.

A four-member Pakistan squash team will take part in the Asian Games to be held
in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou from Nov. 12 to 27.

"Our players are in a superb form and with fine preparation, and we are
optimistic about winning gold medal in the Games," said Irfan Asghar, PSF
secretary general.

"Aamir Atlas Khan, Farhan Mahboob, Yasir Butt and Danish Atlas will feature in
the Games for Pakistan. All the players are working really hard in the camp
under coach," Asghar told Xinhua.

The PSF official said Pakistan would have comparatively easy competition in the
upcoming Asian Games than the recently finished Commonwealth Games in India
where the national players failed to show good results.

Pakistani players used to dominate the game of squash in the international
arena, but now the country is desperately searching its past glory as only three
of its players are in the top 100 Squash World Rankings.

The top squash player of Pakistan, Aamir Atlas Khan, takes the 22nd spot in the
world. Yasir Butt maintains his rankings at No. 59 and Khan's cousin Farhan
Mehboob falls nine places to 45th position.

Pakistan is hoping gold medal because European and Australian players will not
be a part of the competition, officials said.
