Islamic Hamas movement on Thursday said the session that the Palestinian
National Council (PNC) held in the West Bank city of Ramallah was "illegal and
immoral."

"What the PNC discharged betrays the Palestinian understandings, " said Salah
al-Bardaweel, a Hamas lawmaker, adding that " everything resulted from the
meeting is invalid."

The PNC, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)'s parliament, convened
and appointed six members to the vacant seats of the organization's executive
committee.

The PLO represents most of the Palestinian factions except Islamic Hamas
movement, which controls the Gaza Strip, and the less-influential Islamic Jihad.

Hamas, which won the parliamentary elections in 2006, is in the middle of
Egyptian-sponsored talks with Fatah to get its share in the PLO.

Ahmed Bahar, deputy speaker of the Hamas-dominated Palestinian parliament, said
the PNC's sessions "are only convened to bring more misfortunes and disasters to
the Palestinian people and to boost the exclusive possession of power."

Hamas says the PLO and the PNC files are put on the agenda of Egyptian-sponsored
national dialogue which aims at reconciling Hamas and Fatah under a unified
government.
