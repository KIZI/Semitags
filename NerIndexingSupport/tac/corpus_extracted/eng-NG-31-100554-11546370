{OT} The Dims are the real cause of the depression

  2009-03-08T22:21:35  
If you go back and research, the Dims got elected on a promise to do
something about gas prices in '06.  Gas had already hit 2.50 with a brief
fling over 3 dollars in '05 when Katrina hit.

They did NOTHING.  Gas not only went higher, it soared to over 4.25 a gallon
here in the Chicago area even though demand really hadn't jumped up that
much higher.  That is what triggered this economic disaster.

Even the Great Nobama was sad that it had gone up so fast.  Not that he
doesn't want a return to 4 dollar gas.

But they have so many people fooled in the Blue States that they are getting
rewarded for screwing the American economy.

My solution:  Sell New England and New York to Canada, where they can enjoy
the kind of socialized medicine they want. (Sorry Hach, you're in the
minority up there.)  I wonder if we can throw in Wayne County, Michicgan?

Sell California to the Mexicans, they mostly own it anyway.  We paid them 15
million for it in 1848.  Maybe include Clark County, Nevada, too.  They can
keep their RINO governator.

I, for one, do not hold any hope that Obama has any clue what he's doing. If
his scheme works, I'll be the first to admit that I was wrong, but for now
all I can see is a hole that is getting deeper by the day with more and more
money pouring into it.

You are in California, so you know that Governer Arnold is raising our taxes
to cover the state employee pension fund, but he's not doing to cover
private employee pensions. I don't really give a rat's ass about anybody's
pension fund sinking except for mine. I have absolutely no interest in
covering the state employees pensions when my pension is swirling down a
black hole.

As for the federal economic mess, I like to thank the Democrats in Congress
that smothered any effort to reform banking regulations. The problem we are
having today arises -- not exclusively, but almost -- from the notion that
every American has a right to home ownership, even if they have no ability
to pay for a home.

The First Rule of Banking is, the bank wants the money, it does not want the
collateral. When you go the bank with a request for a home loan, they want
you to make the payments, not pick out a home for them to add to their
inventory. They NEVER want the house or the car or the TV set or anything
that you might buy on credit. The bank wants you to want the stuff more than
you want the money, and therfore you send them the money to pay for the
stuff.

The Democrats -- Barney Frank and Chris Dodd -- demanded the banks give
money to people that clearly had no ability to pay for the stuff they bought
with the bank's money. The banks refused to extend loans and were sued as a
result. The banks then were forced to make loans that they knew were bad.
The bank mitigates risk through higher interest rates, but at some point
there is no interest rate that they can collect to cover the certainty of
failure.

You can blame Bush all you want, but the problem actually came from
Congress. This is a failure of the legislators, not the executive branch.
Obama is actually making the problem worse, not better. The proof of this is
the continued tanking of the stock markets. I could be wrong, but somehow I
doubt it.

OK, you're going to have to 'splain it to me, Lucy.  WE had the infamous 69
Cubs that were doing good in August and tanked immediately thereafter.  Here
in Chicagah we ain't nevah heard of da 61 Phillies.

Rigger needs to change his name.  He talks just like the OBG's down in the
PJ's.  Typical DemonCrap.  Blames Bush because they still hate Bush even
though he can't even run for President anymore.    The Congress started it
and now Nobama and the Congress are continuing on their stupid ways, with
stupid people like Rigger supporting them.  That's partly how we got stuck
with Governor BlowJob here in Illinois.  Bucketheads like Rigger think that
Blago was doing a GREAT job as Governor.  As far as I'm concerned people
like Rigger ought to come with a sign. "Warning, Moron Underneath This Hat."

I wonder if they HateBush so much, does that mean they're going to give up
sex, too?  <GD&RRF>

Cubs?  My first home was 3-4 blocks away from

The difference is now, although a fan my entire life,
I'm now more realistic.  And you should be as well.

Your team (Republicans) are losers, losers, losers.
They've followed their own policies, and yes, con-
vinced many others of the correctness of their actions
and receiving their votes as well (it's not all one

Now it's someone elses turn and all I hear from
most pubs is negativity followed by negativity, etc.

Now I am most assuredly not a financial expert,
and neither are 99.99% of the folks in this group
(although some have a little experience), and
the chances of anyone here being able to draft
an economic package are zero.  And yet the

says.

Now the wealthy may have an issue to discuss
because their taxs are going back where they
were before the shoe cut them down.  No
cowardly back-down to the rich lobbyists and
their campaign money from Obama here.

And if I were a poor teacher and heard Obama
say words to the effect:  "If a poor teacher, after
being notified, is unable to boost their performance,
then there is no reason for this person to continue
teaching.", I would have concerns.  No cowardly
back-down to unions from Obama here.

And anyone trying to convince me giving money to
the rich is the better route I say: "Get in line with
your complaint, there are more deserving."

But you may be a limburger follower and kept
perpetually on edge by his appeal to the lowest
common denominator (?) and unable to think

they want to keep the hate flowing and attract/

Stuffs his face while the service men and women suffer!?

Are you blind, the Obama's have held a state dinner just about every night
since they came to power. They're feasting on steaks imported from Japan at
a cost of $100.00 per pound. My steaks ring up at $3.77, and come off the
grill just fine.

I don't recall any porkulus dollars for mold remediation at the VA Hospital.
I could be wrong, but I doubt it. I've read about plenty of pork in the
package that contains no pork according to Obama himself, but I've not seen
anything about his Administration helpiing our men and women in uniform, any
uniform.

I'm not sure what should happen, but what I'd _like_ to see happen is that
you would beat up on Obama the same as you beat up on Bush WHEN Obama does
the same or worse than Bush did. I'd love to see Obama do anything better
than Bush, but I've not seen it so far. I know it is still early, but he's
been around the block a time or two and should have done something right by
now.

We have the stimulus that is tanking the stock market. Seems to me a
stimulus should cause the stock market to remain flat at the very worst, and
should drive the market upward at the very best. All we've seen since the
package was signed into law is another 2000 point drop in the DOW.

Obama indicated that he was sensitive to the influence of lobbyists, and
pledged to not allow any of his staff to become a lobbyist, and not to hire
any current lobbyists onto his staff. Can you say, "waiver?" He's called for
at least 4 exceptions to his own rules on lobbyists.

Obama's pick for Treasury -- the guy that runs the IRS -- failed for four
years to properly file his taxes, and his mistake was so fundemental as to
not be a mistake at all but a willful attempt to defraud the IRS out of
taxes he knew he was supposed to pay.

His pick for Health and Human Services is similarly aflicted, he failed to
file his taxes. We see a pattern developing here that includes his pick for
Commerce. The #2 pick for HHS also has tax issues that prevent her from
being scrutenized -- if anybody looks into her tax cheating, all sorts of
skeletons will fall out o fthe closet to embarass her and her family, so she
backed out of the job.

The top dog over at Justice is a crook from the Clinton Administration that
drove the pardons for Marc Rich -- who turns out to be a campaign donor.
Hmmm, I wonder if there is any connection ... OF COURSE THERE IS!

There's the guy, Guy #2, for the Commerce job that quit before he started
because the White House was taking a significant portion of his job -- the
census -- away from him and putting in a White House Office where the census
is sure to become a political football that is ripe with misdeeds and lies
to screw the citizens of this country.

The guy fingered for Surgeon General is a pretty face from TV -- CNN -- but
he looks to be pretty clean. He dropped out of the job because he prefers
his practice and TV time. Obama's only mistake here is picking and promoting
a guy that has no interest in the job. Obama should have figured out that
the guy didn't want the job before he announced him for the spot. This one
falls into the category of, you win  some and you lose some. The problem is,
his misses seem to outnumber the hits.

I don't particularly care about the specifics. My only beef is that you piss
& moan, and pitch a fit over Bush's ineptitude, but have given the Bamster a
bye on each and every display of ineptness that has come down the pike since
he hit the campaign trail.

You raised the issue of Haliburton and no-bid contracts. These kinds of
things have been around for several decades. I'm not pretending they are
proper, and I agree that there needs to be reform in this area. But, I'd
like to point out that ACORN does nothing, and the Bamster cut loose with
several million in porkulus to them. ACORN brings "no-bid" contract to a
whole new low. They don't even do anything and they get the money.

You'll hear PLENTY from me about Obama, when the time comes; just as

"We have the stimulus that is tanking the stock market. Seems to me a

The stock market is made up of gamblers who don't like to lose money.
If
Obama were to begin funneling more money to banks and other financial
institutions no doubt the dow would rise.  But to many the level of
the dow
is NOT a good indicator of the health of the country; Damn man, don't
you
remember how the dow would go UP upon news of high unemployment?
I do.

The stock market will have to console itself and then wait for the
"Trickle
Up" effect, AFTER the people get their stimulus and begin spending
money again.  Their greed is what helped create the mess we're in.

Ineptness I understand but torture secret prisons, destroying tapes,
instructions to ignore Congress etc., etc., etc.... this scum is a
criminal.  Where did the missing billions in cash go?????  Those
bastards stonewalled every issue.  They belong in jail.

"You raised the issue of Haliburton and no-bid contracts. These kinds

Name me ANY situation like this give-away before this time.  Where
were
the protests while it was happening (besides from dems).  Don't get me
wrong, I know where you're coming from; even today there are many
"Deutchlanders" who will defend Hitler; and everyone, I'm sure,
notices
the similarities between the two.  The problem is many buy into these
theories so far it's almost impossible to stop when confronted with
another ideology; the result I'm sure of contention vs. cooperation.

And were there mistakes made in selecting personnel?  Of course.
Did you think Obama was above error?????LOL

But Bush had the same problems vetting flakes that he should have stayed
miles away from. The liberal left decried everything Bush said or did that
was an even remotely poor choice, even if the choice later turned out to be
good -- which they would ignore. George Bush could only do bad. Karl Rove is
the worst Cheif of Staff to ever reign in the White House, but Rahm Emanuel
is the devil incarnate and nobody seems to care. You guys bitched that Rove
wiped his ass backwards, but Emanuel can smear shit on the walls and you're
giving him a bye. I don't get it.

Now Obama is picking pond scum for cabinet level positions, and the liberal
left is completely and utterly silent. I thought you guys hated to be lied

All I can see is lying, cheating, and secrets, and you are letting it go by.

It's bye -- as in, the position of a participant in a tournament who
advances to the next round without playing.

Buy is to purchase.

When a sleeze-ball is given a good job that he is not qualified to do and
nobody challenges it, he or she is said to have been given a bye. A footbal
team gets Sunday off, that's a bye week. Bush farts and makes the headlines,
Obama craps on the White House lawn and the media gives him a bye. These are
examples of advancement without playing.

Rahm Emanuel is perhaps the lowest of the low in Chicago Politics. Blago is
perhaps the only person lower, but only because he got caught. Rahm Emanuel
is knownn to have mailed a package of dead fish to a rival -- this is a
mob-sign indicating that one is about to meet Jimmy Hoffa, swim with the
fishes, wear cement shoes, etc. Rahm Emanuel is a crook. Blago is a crook
that got caught. About the only difference is if one is on the inside of the
bars looking out.

Obama goes to church for 20 years with a pastor that screams
anti-Americanism from the pulpit and gets a bye. Obama is on a school board
with a guy that actively promoted bombing American police stations and the
FBI building and was caught DOING IT, the media gives him a bye. Bush drank
at a 4th of July party 20 years ago and drove into town for more beer, and
the media made it a headline story. Bush got permission from his squadron
commander to go to Alabama and the media called it going AWOL.
Anti-Americanism and homegrown terrorist versus clooege-age drinking and
false charges of AWOL. If the media was going to ignore one or the other --
give one a bye -- which would you prefer? I'd much rather have a Prez that
signed up to serve his country and then get an assignment stateside, and
that realized too late that he's not well suited to the enjoyment of
alocholic beverages than to have an unvetted President that was rasied for
20 years with anti-American sentiments and a radical terrorist for a friend.
If you ask me, the wrong guy got the bye.

As for the past 8 years, most of it has gone reasonably well in my book --
mortgage lending being a notable exception. Maybe you can find a Democrat to
explain what the House Banking and Senate Finance commttees do, and who ran
them for the past ten or so years. I'll give you a hint, those committees
were run by Democrats.

I'm not pretending that Bush is blameless, but I am saying that the Dems
were in it up to their ears. Before you point your crooked little fingers,
you should make sure they are pointed the right way.

education he's doing more than any president I've
had the honor to vote for; he refuses to turn his
back on the things we all know are true.

Did you ever hear a comment from bush & co
whenever a study would show how poorly the
U.S. is doing in education and health care
when compared to the rest of the world???

Stonewalling is what you saw from previous
administrations.  Transparency is what you
see from Obama, not "sweep it under the
carpet."

But some, who'd like to remain sheep or be
treated like little children, would rather go
along with politicos making all the rules,
behind closed doors, for them.

"As for the past 8 years, most of it has gone reasonably well in my

And while the pubs had a lock on congress and the presidency how,
exactly (not: He was a crook!!) did the dems get ON these commit-

discontinue the lies unless you have some proof.

And as far as "unqualified" what made your boss rush so smart?
Was it the drugs???  Maybe you feel he would be a better head
of state????  I wouldn't be surprised to hear you say so.

Rush is not my boss.

The chair of a committee is not dependent upon a majority in Congress, so
Franks and Dodd can chair a committee even if they are not the party holding
a majority. They clearly, and historically factually, prevented the very
regulations needed to control the activity of the lenders. Lenders were sued
for NOT making loans that they felt were requested by uncreditworthy
borrowers. They expanded the provisions of the CRA, which had a noble goal
before it was stretched to give loans to bad borrowers.

Republicans were calling for reforms as early as 2003 or 2004, and Franks
and Dodd said everything was fine. Indeed, Barney Franks said in August 2007
that Fannie and Freedie were in good shape. Both Fannie and Freddie were
gone by September. Franks HAD to say Fannie and Freedie were in good shape
because he had spent years tearing down the regulations that kept them from
making bad loans or buying them so the banks that made them could make more.

Nothing I've said is untested or unproven. It is fact that Repubicans,
including the Bush Administration, were sounding alarms in '02, '03, '04 and
'05. Franks and Dodd stood in the way of any kind of reform.

Nobody is making up stories. They are playing video clips from interviews
and re-reporting news from the pages of the newspapers of the day. The truth
of Franks and Dodd is published in a variety of forms, all you have to do is
pay attention.

Search for BARNEY FRANK FANNIE 2002
http://frankwarner.typepad.com/free_frank_warner/2008/09/barney-frank...

There are several dozen cites of the misdeeds of Barney Frank, Chuck Shumer,
and Chris Dodd. All you have to do is read, or you can tune into YouTube and
watch if reading taxes your brain cell too much.

There are two things in this world that float.  Ivory Soap and crap.
Rigger's opinions aren't Ivory Soap.

I'm not sure if we're on Clinton's 3d term or Carter's 2nd.

Improve security???  Is that a joke??

I, and everyone else in the U.S. I'd imagine, watched as
our victorious invaders entered Bagdad and stood around
as all the museums were plundered; what was that???

And stood around MORE while the armories were raided
and tons and tons of explosives stolen which are now
being used to kill our troops; no effort by our army to
stop it.  What kind of leadership lets this happen?  Why
did this happen, just stupidity?

This we know happened; and we now know the results
of our "leadership" without needing to speculate about
Clinton, or anyone else.

In the years I've voted since the early '60s I've grown increasingly
dissatisfied with all politicians.  Almost without fail I believe
their only over-riding concern is how to remain in office.  The
money, travel and other gifts they accept from lobbyists is
nothing but graft, pure-and-simple; or are we supposed to be so
foolish as to believe this is just a little gift from a friend???

I think Obama may (I said "may" don't forget) be a "good" one.
His voting record and political position has changed very little,
although, I'm sure,  there are many who would offer him any-
thing to change his position.

Only time will tell how well he will succeed against the massed
opposition.
