Six river otters from the Pacific Northwest have been released into the ice cold water of a river in northern New Mexico as part of an effort to return the mammals to their historic range.

The wild otters were trapped in Washington state and transported to New Mexico, where they were checked out by state game officials before Friday's early morning release. They will join 10 other otters that were released in the Rio Pueblo de Taos last October.

Local authorities and conservation groups have been working to get the otters back into New Mexico's rivers.

Otters disappeared from New Mexico more than a half-century ago due to decades of trapping and habitat loss.
