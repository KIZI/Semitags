 
 
800,000 people rally against western backed government in lebanon
 
 
Why is the west still suporting the government? dont they want democracy? Theres democracy for you! Despite the western prop campaign against the opposition, at least 800,000 people in a country of 3.5million population are on the streets wanting the government to change. With 800,000 people protesting in a country where there are many immigrants, etc i can tell you thats a huge number!! and its AT LEAST 800,000 - those are sec forces estimates - but hezbullah put the numer at 1mil+.

So why is john bolton callign this a syrian attempt to coup? when there were 500,000 demonstrating against the pro-syrian government, everyoen called on it to resign to 'peoples will' - why arent they saying that now? the fact of the matter is that their true colours are showing, they dont believe in democracy. They believe in conditional democracy when its for their interests, they support it. When its not, theyre against it.

BEIRUT - Hundreds of supporters of Lebanon's Hezbollah-led opposition camped out in central Beirut on Saturday on the second day of protests to demand the resignation of the U.S.-backed government.

"No matter how long they stay in the street... this will not bring down the government of (Prime Minister) Fouad Siniora," Sunni Muslim leader Saad al-Hariri, who backs Siniora, told Al Hurra television late on Friday.

---- Doesnt that sound liek a dictator?? when the people want you to quit, you're supposed to quit, not say that ur not quitting no matter how long they stay on the street! Where are your 'western' values??

"I wish that the prime minister and his ministers were among us today, not hiding behind barbed wire and army armored carriers. He who has his people behind him does not need barbed wire," Aoun told the crowd.

The guerrilla group hopes the mass demonstration, which police
estimated at 800,000 but Hezbollah claimed was larger, will generate enough popular pressure to further paralyze Siniora's government, forcing it to step down.

In New York, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton labeled the demonstrations as "part of the Iran-Syria inspired coup d'etat."

"We obviously hope the demonstrations will be peaceful. People have a right to express their political opinions, but in terms of this being part of the Iran-Syria inspired coup d'etat against the government of Lebanon we're obviously quite concerned about it," Bolton said.

--GO TO HELL BOLTON!!
 
 
and whats funny is that everyone carried the news of 200,000 pro-government protesting on their front page headlines but NO WESTERN MEDIA put the 800,000 opposition protest on their headlines. WHY?
 
 
The govenrment was elected. If the "poeple" want to get rid of them wait till the next election.

And the notion that no "WESTERN MEDIA" have carried it is a LIE

You're a ****ing moron. Democracy isnt deciding who runs a country based on a few hundred thousand people protesting.

If you want to change go ****ing vote.

 
"We obviously hope the demonstrations will be peaceful. People have a right to express their political opinions, but in terms of this being part of the Iran-Syria inspired coup d'etat against the government of Lebanon we're obviously quite concerned about it," Bolton said.

Don't like the truth do you?
 
 
If Syria wanted to destabalise the DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED Lebanese government then they certainly succeeded. Interesting to see viva jump into bed with yet ANOTHER group of terrorists

Oh wait.. you forgot that protests are what brought this government to power and you forgot the numerous 'protests' in history that has brought down dictatorships.

Surely, the people have decided that the government has failed them and they dont wnat it anymore. Why do you guys hate freedom?

IF there were 800,000 in palestine demanding the resignation of hamas, you wouldve seen everyone getting wet about it and all the western hypocrits saying 'the government has to resign' and u wud have it front page headliones in every news website. But since this is against western interests, then its not important anymore.

If you want a new government elect one. Stop expecting the government to leave because a minority take to the streets when they were elected freely and fairly.

You haven't even begun to acquire a concept of democracy.

I dont hate freedom. That's what the ME is for...

Pure conjecture. You have no idea what I would be saying or what the British government would be saying. Its just a moronic conlusion you have dreamed up to suit yourself.

The fact remains is that:

a) There is no proof it is 800,000 people
b) 800,000 is still a minority of the Lebanese population and as such have no power to dictate who runs the country.

As said - you have no idea what democracy is. But then being from the ME who could expect you to.

800,000 people... thats a MINORITY.

Thats even assuming that that figure is correct.

Or are you simply assuming that all Christians and Sh'ites are in favour of houdning the present government out of office on the basis of their religion?

Sorry, GUESSING at numbers doesn't constitute a majority in a democracy. Majorities are established by voters at polls, not by how many people of each group you think support something or other.
However, with you being a Syrian I don't expect you to have much idea how democracy works.

Umm.. every media source and the internal security forces estimated 800,000 people. Thats AT LEAST.

800,000 protesting is a minority? are you kidding me? what, you think every mebmer of the opposition is gonna take to the streets? you think that the south is empty of people now? Surely, you are becoming DESPERATE.

800,000 is about 25% of the lebanese population. If 25% of the pop are on the streets, doesnt that tell you something about its popularity? Lol.

They want a national unity government where everyone is represented. They dont want to 'rule' the country.

Arguing with you is pointless. The number of insults uve hurled at me as well is huge so im putting you on ignore as theres no point arguing with you. Even if 3 million people were on the street ur gonna say the government has a right to stay so you keep your opinion and ill keep mine and we'll see which one turns out to be right.
 
 
Oh Jesus Christ, grow up! You make it sound as though a flash mob of 800,000 puppet protestors is tantamount to an election, and therefore justifies a change of government. FFS!

I said 60% of the pop are opposition. 800,000 are on the streets.

And with the last comment you made about religion, you have shown that you know nothing about lebanese politics because in lebanon, you join parties based on your sect. Hariri's are all sunnis, hez and amal are shiites, FPM and LF are christians. Learn some facts.

Doesn't speak well for the Syrian education system does it.

because "freedom" should have constitutional bounds, such as regular elections. Else governments would be precarious and unstable, and lead to incoherent and instable government (exactly what there is in Lebanon). Also, people really aren't the best people to make political decisions, given their lack of political knowledge and that they can be easily swayed by populists. For me the ideal democracy is one with very tight limits on participation. Democratic governments should not be brought down by protests.

They are asking for early elections. Is that too much when 25% of te people are on the streets demanding it?

And dont you think that around 50%+ of the population have a right to have a say in the leading of the country?
 
 
Yes-it is. It shows a fundamental disrespect for democratic instutions, and caving in the publics every whim leads to incoherent and ineffective government. The Lebanese elected the current government and now they are stuck with them.

Oh, and please don't use post report to report EVERYONE who disagrees with you, or you'll get points for misuse.

What are you tlaking about? YOU'RE THE ONE thats been brainwashed here!

Show me one source that says there were syrian demonstrators yesterday and today!! The sources u brought were from March 8 2005 for god sake!! hehe.. someone getting desperate i guess?

They were insulting fo2ad sanyora and saad hariri? LOL. And march 14 werent insulting nesrallah and 3on? for god sake they were burbning 3on and nesrallah's pictures. Why are you being so ignorant?? I trhought u were smarter than this.

And about hariri building all this.. all i can do is laugh because surely you dont know much about lebanese history where everyone knows that hariri is one of the most corrupt people in the history of lebanon. He stole all the money and built businesses with it. Great isnt it?

Using history isnt a very good idea beacuse history isnt your friend..

remember who butchered christians in the civil war? GA3GA3 AND JUBMLATT
remember who blew up a church? GAEGAE

oh and wait you forgot something.. what nationality is hariri? SAUDI. You want a saudi leading ur country? hehe. Those people who you associate yourselves with are the most hypocritical, corrupt and murderous in the world. Their corruption scandals are endless - you know that saniora is hariri's accountant dont you ? and you know that there weere billions of dollars disappearing in leb since marc 14 took over and you KNOW that all of march 14 were the only reason syria could stay in lebanon ESPECIALLY HARIRI who was the #1 supporter of syria but wait.. bush made a higher bid for him and took him and jumblatt.

People like you unfortunately are the reason lebanon lives under foreign rule at the moment but fortunately, we have seen that there are many, MANY lebanese who are not like you. Infact, the yare the majority!

PS: If you wanna talk about rudeness, read up on whos pictures were beign burnt in achrafiyeh by your friends
 
 
lebanon4ever, forget about how much you hate syria and think of how useless seniora's government is. All it cares about is the tribunal:

-It doesnt care about the economy
-It doesnt care about creating jobs
-It doesnt care about defending the country
-It doesnt care about the 1200 leb who died in the war in cold blood

All they talk about is the tribunal. Doesnt that make you tihnk they are trying to accomplish the goals of someone else?

sry abt da sources... da thing is i saw it yesterday on tv.... so i did a search & dis is what came up... i didnt look at the date.... my mistake...

and if yyou havnt noticed, achhrafieh is a christian town... and most of the pics burnt were already hung up... which means that many of them are Aouns own supporters turning against him...

second of all... hariri is lebanese "ghas bin 3annak" (like how they say in lebanese   ) and has a saudi nationality... likewise... im lebanese but i have a british nationality... it doesnt mean im british & not lebanese does it???
and besides even if he was saudi arabian.... i prefer a saudi guy to a syrian or iranian... so wats ur point??? a

nd by the way.. i have nothing against "syrians" im no racist.... but when they want to make problems in lebanon then yeah.... in that case i hate them...but i still have syrian friends though.... they havnt done anything to lebanon....

Incorrect. When they tried to hang the pictures again, the 3on supporters were attacked by LF supporters, theres an artciel on  www.dailystar.com.lb  about it.

See, now we can see what your true intentiuons are. You prefer 'saudis' over 'syrians' so you are admitting hariri has his allegiance to saudia arabia mroe than lebanon.

You have nothing against 'syrians' but you hate syria with a passion. its time to wake up and see what the march 14 have made out of the country.

future tv... they interviewed the bus drivers & the ppl inside them... & showed us the borders full of buses coming from syria one day before the demo... i repeat... al manar and other pro syrian propaganda channels would not show such a thing

 
Incorrect. When they tried to hang the pictures again, the 3on supporters were attacked by LF supporters, theres an artciel on  www.dailystar.com.lb  about it.
 

your link is about yesterday and is totally irrelevent to Aoun & his pictures.... even your argument that the LF attacked 3on suuporter is irrelevent coz if they have turned against Aoun then obviously theyre gonnna be with either katayeb or LF

 
See, now we can see what your true intentiuons are. You prefer 'saudis' over 'syrians' so you are admitting hariri has his allegiance to saudia arabia mroe than lebanon.
 

the logic of this i will never get..

 
You have nothing against 'syrians' but you hate syria with a passion. its time to wake up and see what the march 14 have made out of the country.
 

I repeat.. hate syrians who have bad intentions in lebanon..yes
hate syrians do want to get involved in anything to do with lebanon...no

another quest... ur syrian right??? i dont mean anything but why are u so concerned abt lebanon???

you didnt read my post properly.... by "already hung up" i meant that they were hung up well before they were burnt down.. lso obviously they were auonist houses who had his ppics up... wen pieree was killed they burnt them down & turned agaist him... i repeat this was many of the cases.. ofcourse,many others were already against him (katayeb & lf)

i bet everyone is just staring at this thread going like "what da hell are they talking about!!!??? "      
 
 
4 pro-government christian deputies have declared themselves independant.. source: al akhbar newspaper.

This brings the followign numbers to parliament:

68 FM and allies (hariri and allies)
21 FPM (aoun)
37 Amal, Hizb and allies.
4 Independents

so now we have 58 opposition and 68 pro-government MPs. Not gonna be nice when all the opposition Mps resign is it?

haha yea i know they are..

anyways. No they werent hung up just before they were burnt. Achrafiyeh is well known to have aoun posters. Ive been there numerous times.. and there r numerous aoun posters.. i dunno wut u talking baout..
 
 
WTF, the Times only has a figure of 200,000.

Anyway, whatever the figure, this is an attempt by Hizbullah to seize power. Physically besieging your government is not a legitmate means of democratic change.

200,000 is a pathetic claim but knowing its owned by rupert murdoch then im not surprised.

Its an attempt by 60% of the population to have a say in the running of their country.

Is that a crime?
 
 
even the times says 800,000. Dont know where u got 200,000 from.

 http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article...482819,00.html 
"800,000 on streets in revolution to put Lebanon in hands of Hezbollah"
 
 
Maybe it was going on yesterday's figures and another 600,000 turned up today or something. The paper itself, rather than the website, definitely said 200,000.

If the demonstrations were spontaneous, I might be inclined to view them as parallel to the peaceful revolutions of the ex-Soviet states in the 1990s. As things stand, though, Hizbullah's hand in stirring things up is unmistakeable. They are essentially marshalling things.
 
 
interesting comments by the times:

"A quarter of the population joined the demonstration. Many, even those in Western dress, carried pictures of Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader (Nabil Mounzer/EPA)"

A quarter of the population are in the streets. Isnt that enuff reason for the government to at least give them 1/3 of the cabinet or call for early elections?

Is that a crime?

 

You are asserting that it is 60% based on a laughably inaccurate guess of what proportion of each group would support it. There is nothing concrete to suggest 60% of Lebanese favour toppling the government. And even if there were, so what?
Virtually every election in the UK ends up with a majority of people NOT having voted for the governing party. So if all the non-Labour voters in the UK (60+%) went out on the streets and protested against the government tomorrow would that mean that democracy demanded the resignation of the government? No, of course not, that would be retarded, because the country would NEVER be able to have a government.

Simply put, you're being ridiculous and illogical.

No, it's not. Learn how democracy functions before spouting such garbage.
 
 
Yeh, take a look at Iraq now if u want to know what "democracy" is

I'm confused. I would have thought Viva was from Italy, going by his username. However, he can't possibly be because of his stance on the Middle East. Surely he knows that not too far down the list of targets is Rome.

Lebanon, Isreal, Istanbul, Rome....

Are you an Italian muslim by any chance?

It's either that or he's extremely misguided and foolishly over optimistic of how the countries and forces he sticks up for will treat him when they turn up on his doorstep.

'Oh hello. Gosh, I've been sticking up for you for' Woosh!

Yes, britneybritish is gonna save us all from an islamic invasion of the entire world.

As for the OP, i dont know much about the Lebanese track record nor what government these protestors want. However, if its an elected government and indeed people want change, the very fact its a democarcy will mean change will occur. After all the politicians do want to get reelected.

He's a Syrian Christian. Which is why when he's not busy cheerleading for the destruction of Israel, he's insisting that what the Lebanese really want is to be controlled by Syria.
 
 
Guys - and that means all of you - play nicely otherwise the whole lot of you can be expecting more warning points. Bloody hell, is it really that hard to keep a debate civil?!

How does your estimate of 800'000 people equate to 60% of the population?

There is absolutely NO need for pointless nasty bullying by a 25 year old man. So what if her arguments aren't good? So what if you think she's stupid. Making posts like this on a forum are as equal to playground bullying in real life. You and Jon should just grow up a bit, or let out some steam.Or something.

Cry me a river. People come here voluntarily and say what they want. If it's cretinous or deceitful then we're going to say so. I hold people to the same standards, I don't let people talk crap and lie simply because they aren't good at debating or are a bit younger or ignorant whatever. If they want to come in here and spout off then they should be able to handle the consequences. If you don't like having what you say mocked or torn apart than either talk sense and be honest or stay in Chat. As for the way that Lawz- deals with viva, I think it's entirely appropriate considering that viva gets consistently beaten in arguments, exposed as a liar, etc. and still routinely asserts "victory".

I think it is a tad pathetic that people allow themselves to get so immersed in the way other people write, and so into it in general, that they feel the need to directly, and viciously attack. Its just a random person writing on a forum, with a different(maybe less intelligent) opinion to your own. The vitriolic abuse you direct at him shows a lack self-control, and shows you to be just plain nasty, and silly. You and Lawz have a penchant for these "character assassinations", almost as though you are bullying people on here. So bloody what if he talks utter crap? And lies? If you can show through intelligent, RATIONAL debate that this is so, we can all make up our own minds about the person inquestionn. What we don't need is grown-people calling people stupid and very very childish names, and directing people to laugh at them.

We all criticise, we all name call. I've done it myself. But not in the way that you and Lawz sometimes do. Just no need. Stop it.

800,000 is 25% of the population. Obviously you havent read my posts. I said 60% of the pop support the opposition because:

Amal and Hezbullajh represent all the shi'ites - 40% of the population
The FPM and the maradeh represent half or more of the christians - about 15% of the population
Omar karame and other sunni politicians represent about 5%

that makes 60% opposition.

Any disagreement?

The way they argue only shows how desperate they are because they know they are wrong but they will stick to any argument that makes an anti-western or anti-israeli look bad no matter what.

If 800,000 protested against hamas government, BELIEVE ME they wil both make threads about it and start calling for the government to change because the ppl want it to and because they support freedom and democracy but suddenly democracy changes when it comes to their enemies!

Do you believe, as many Syrians (Your origin was really pretty obvious from your radical arabist rhetoric before this pronouncement), such as the SSNP, that Lebanon or 'Palestine' is really part of 'Southern Syria'? aka 'Greater Syria'?

Lebanon should be part of syria but not palestine.

Lebanon was created to be a christian state in the middle east carved out of syria (look at the map and you will realized) it has existed for 70 yrs only and the fact that its not christian anymore makes it pointless to exist.

However, the fact of the matter is that lebanon is a sovereign country now and it should stay that way. I believe it should be syrian but i dont want it to be anymore becuase its a sovereign nation which has the right for self determination.

So you barely believe in 'Lebanon' and not really an independent one.
That it was/and is really part of Syria.

and that the Middle east should look approximately like this; (ssnp.com)
(for others here ssnp is Syrian Socialist National Party)

 

Of course, virtually every Arab country.. like Jordan, Kuwait, Iraq, etc have also only existed for 70 years as well.

The whole complex of countries, carved out of the Remnants of the Ottoman Empire and given as spoils to some Saudi Princes.

Thus our problem with Iraq today.
This weird Tri-glomeration should NEVER have been a country in the first place.

Introduction: A Neglected Topic

from Greater Syria: The History of an Ambition

Her Majesty's Government has stated that it considers Syria to be the military key of Asiatic Turkey.
- Lord Palmerston, 1840

On first entering Syria, the observant traveler will probably be startled to go through passport control and notice a military map of Syria on the wall, for this map contains several Anomalies.
It shows the Golan Heights under Syrian control, though they have been occupied by Israel since 1967. Syria's boundaries with Lebanon and Jordan appear not as international borders but as something called "regional" borders.
Israel does not even exist; instead, there is a state called Palestine. And Palestine is separated from Syria by a line designated a "temporary" border".
Finally, the province of Hatay, a part of Turkey since 1939, appears to be included in Syria; only on close inspection can one see the "temporary" border between it and Syria.

The many inaccuracies on this map reflect the Syrian rulers' profound unwillingness to accept the actual size and shape of the country they administer.
They remember that until 1920, "Syria" referred to a region much larger than the Syrian Arab Republic of today, a region that stretched from the borders of Anatolia to those of Egypt, from the edge of Iraq to the Mediterranean Sea.
In terms of today's states, the Syria of old comprised Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan, plus the Gaza Strip and Alexandretta. This larger land, known since 1920 as Greater Syria, is what they dream of reclaiming.

Pan-Syrianism-the intention to piece together a Greater Syrian nation-is not a new phenomenon but has strongly influenced politics in the Middle East since 1918. The division of Greater Syria after World War I proved one of the worst of many political traumas experienced in the Middle East at that time. Pan-Syrianism explains many of the conflicting aspirations among Syrians, Lebanese, Palestinians, Israelis, and Jordanians; it lies behind much of the volatility of public life in Jordan and Syria; and it partially accounts for the Lebanese civil war and the Arab-Israeli conflict. The goal of pieving Syria's parts together drove Jordanian foreign policy for over two decades, and it had nearly as great a role in Iraq. The future of the West Bank is bound up with this dream. Pan-Syrianism helps comprehend complex interactions between Pan-Arabists, Palestinian nationalists, and state authorities.

The party that has advocated Greater Syria since 1932, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), has had profound political importance in the twentieth-century history of the two states where it has been most active, Lebanon and Syria. As the first political party fully to embrace radical secular ideals, it incubated virtually every radical group in those countries, with particularly great impact on the Ba'th Party. The SSNP offered the minorities, especially the Greek Orthodox Christians, a vehicle for political action and caused several of Lebanon's worst political crises. Its ideology influenced the development of Pan-Arabism (or Arab nationalism) and defined inter-Arab relations in the Levant region. Leading intellectuals such as Abu Khaldun Sati' al-Husri and Kamal Junbalat devoted considerable energy to combating Pan-Syrianism..."

Historically, I believe that lebanon is a part of syria. HOWEEVER, I do not support attempting to make it part of syria as i recognize its independance and sovereignty.

Is that too hard to understand?
 
 
and let me remind you that those protests covered both squares: riyad al solh and martyrs square while the march 8 and march 14 protests that brought down the pro-syrian government years ago covered the squares one at a time so we can see that this protest is waayy bigger than the other one!!

Apart from the fact that your figures seem to be based on pure guesswork and rough estimates? And apart from the fact that there's virtually no democratic country out there where the governing party has a majority of people behind it?
I could do exactly the same thing with the UK figures and demonstrate how only 30-40% support Labour. That doesn't mean I'd support it if the government was overthrown before the next election, nor do I think that would represent "democracy".
 
 
Yet more proof that Hizbollah and Syria are troublemaking terrorists.

yes - you can't substantiate those claims.

Also - as L4E pointed out, the population is 4.3million, hence that does not represent 25% of the population.

Won't comment on the first paragraph. The second, i agree absolutely. Not just them, but most people like to use stats to suit themselves, its natural, if a tad disingenuous. They would view it as a significant shout against Hamas, so they should view the 800,000 protesters as a significant amount in this case too. But whatever.

you're pathetic. How can i not substantiate those claims???

40% of lebanon are shiite and ALL of them are ither amal or hezbullah. There are no other shi'ite parties. I dunno wuts wrogn with you people

and the population of lebanon is 3.5million according to the cia factbook. Even the times said '25% ogf the population was on the streets'

but its okay i know you're grtting desperate.
 
 
You're assuming that people are definitely going to vote along their religious lines - which obviously isn't the case.

Ok i dont want to be rude here but obviously yuou dont know much about lebanese politics.

In lebanon, they vote according to their religion, not according to their political views. That is well known. there are no muslim members of christian groups and no christian members of hezbullah or amal for example.
 
 
Yes, because this is a purely religious issue...even if people do vote with their religion, does not mean that they will necessarily agree with these actions taken dependant upon that grouping.

you can belong to a number of diff parties depending on ur religion so there are plenty of parties and one of them probably suits your views.

its 40% not 35%.

Cia doesnt have expired info:

3,574,050 (July 2006 est.)

i dont think it become 4.3 since july..
 
 
oh my god you guys are gonna go on about this forever...

Lets say for the sake of argument that only 50% of the population are opposition, not 60%. SHouldnt that give them a third of the cabinet at least?
 
 
then they have wrong info  

this is too tempting to post!!!:

Yes. My argument about all shi'ites being opposition is 100% correct.

If you think its not, then you seriously know little about lebanese politics because u wouldnt be able to imagine one shi'ite being with the government.

Aha! Interesting. It just goes to show that your enemy's enemy isn't always your friend.
 
 
-LF militia re arming
-West is arming pro-government militias to fight hezbullah
-1 killed and lots injured in clashes accross beirut. (killed is opposition shi'ite')

All show that lebanon is edging towards civil war because the western backed dictators hate freedom and dont want to give in to the people's wants.

1. The current Lebanese government was elected. Please explain how an elected government are "dictators".
2. So far all you have done is used ridiculous guesswork to try and assert that a majority of Lebanese want the government to fall. You have consistently ignored the fact that virtually no democratic government on Earth has received 50% backing from the populace in elections, but that does not render them all undemocratic.
3. You seem to think that elections bring about dictators, but large displays of force, assassinations and threatening fighting on the streets brings about democracy. That is utterly backwards.
4. "Civil war" is being fomented by Hezbollah and pro-Syrian elements in Lebanon, it is not being fomented by the elected government.
5. You're Syrian and from what I've seen really like Syria. How's all the democracy there working for you? You have the nerve to accuse the elected Lebanese government of being dictators?

definition of dictator: A ruler who is not restricted by a constitution, laws or any opposition.

It is very clear in the lebanese consititution that every sect has to be represented in the cabinet but at the moment the shi'ites, the biggest sect in lebanon, arent represented at all.

Its not ridiculous 'guesswork' - its fact. all of the shi'ites are oposition and half of the christians are opposition. Why do you hate freedom so much?

woah.. so many fallaces there..kk one by one

- 'large displays of force' - as far as ive seen in the demonostrations, not one person was carrying a gun. Infact, everyone was carrying the lebanese flag, not even the hezbullah or FPM one.
-'assasinations' - you have absolutely no proof that the opposition killed pierre gemayel and such. Infact, obvious evidence from the scene leads us to beleive that the assasins were supported by the security forces in lebanon.
-'threatening fighting' - show me one source that has a 'threat' to fight by the opposition

Plagiarism is such a dirty thing...  

 

As a christian in syria, i dont mind the baathist party in the government even tho they are dictators but they are also secular and they give christians full freedoms. If syria was to be ruled by anyone else, it would be an extreme islamic sunni state and christians would be opressed and murdered.
 
 
its all about the white stuff Jon   see me as a mere arbiter

BECAUSE THEY ALL WALKED OUT OF THE CABINET!
The Lebanese government remain bound by constitution, laws and opposition - to say that they don't because a certain group who are TRYING to destabilise the country VOLUNTARILY resigned from the Cabinet is just absurd.

Yeah, generally when someone says "all" of something and "half" of something, they're guessing, estimating and generalising. That's a rule.

Who said that this was the "display of force"? I'm referring to the recent Hezbollah demonstrations, not to the current ones.

Once again, this is not the only assassination. There have been a string of such killings, beginning with the assassination of Rafik Hariri. And all the evidence points at Syria and its agents.

The objective of bringing down the government is announced openly. There have been displays of force, assassinations and violent clashes. Would you like to inform me exactly what happens if the government doesn't resign? Hezbollah just pack up and go home, right? There are many sources predicting civil war.

Aww, YOU don't mind the dictators in Syria, so it's all OK! So, you don't mind Syrian dictatorship, yet you're ranting and raving about the "evil freedom-hating dictators" (elected) in Lebanon? Jeez, could there be any clearer case of double-standards.

How about democracy? Not every State has to have a dictatorship! As for "opressed and murdered" - would you like to tell me how you think Syrian agents and Hezbollah would do things if coming to power in Lebanon? I'm sure it'd just be a barrel of laughs for the anti-Syrians and non-Shias, right?

It doesnt matter if they resigned or not. They are not represented at the moment and so the government is not constitutional. It is very clear about this.

you're pathetic.. the point being is that nearly 40% of the population are shi'ites and nearly 30% are christians.. so its safe to say that at least 50% of the people are opposition. Anything other than that is pathetic. The real number is mroe like 60%+

Which recent ones? all of hezb's demos are peaceful and none of them use any sign of force. Do you think its a display of force to have your supporters rally? again, why do you hate freedom?

What evidence are you talking about? can you show me sources? the first investigation implicated syrian agents based on CIRCUMSTANCIAL evidence claiming 'no one else has the capacity to do such a thing' which is pathetic. You cant get a thief convicted based on that kind of evidence.

the objective of the demonstrations is the legitimate right for the opposition to have at least 1/3 of the cabinet but since they have refused, the government has to resign. It has no constitutional bases anyways or popular basis.

Umm.. weve seen how pro-syrians have been during the 16 yrs they were in power (where hariri, the main anti-syrian was their main supporter back then as well as jumblatt). It was much more stable back then. You could argue that it was corrupt but this government isnt clean either and the corruption back then was by the syrian agents and the syrian security officials. The syrian agents being hariri, jumblatt, etc.

Aha! So, he is clearly backing down from his previous explicit accusation that the Lebanese government are "dictators", to the far more tame "the government is not constitutional", whilst also admitting that the only reason that is the case is due to the voluntary conduct of the Shia cabinet members. That's quite a climb-down.

36% of the British voters voted Labour at the last election. So it's safe to say that "the opposition" in Britain is more than 60%. That still does not make it either democratic or legitimate for that 60% to take to the streets and demand the downfall of the government. (Not to mention the fact that saying things like "all" and "half" smacks of guesswork and generalisation, as said before). And even if all those people are "opposition" - who's to say that they all want the government to fall? Maybe some of them are more concerned with stable democracy than chaos and faction-fighting?

Let's put aside the ridiculous notion that a heavily-armed militia can hold "peaceful" demonstrations without implicit force threatened, and cast our minds back a couple of months to the big Hezbollah "victory parades" in Beirut. Plenty of force on show there.

When you're a heavily-armed non-State militia challenging the authority of the government, yes, I think force is decidedly implicit when you stage big rallies in the capital.

... Look, if you're going to flatly deny any Syrian involvement in high-profile assassinations of important anti-Syrian figures in Lebanon, there's really no point talking to you - because you will simply play dumb.

Nice bit of code there, unfortunately for you, I actually know what I'm talking about. For those of you who are unaware, having 1/3 + 1 of the seats in the Cabinet would allow pro-Syrian and Hezbollah elements to VETO any Cabinet action they disagree with. So, basically, the Lebanese government would be incapable of taking any action not to the satisfaction of Hezbollah and Syria.
Convenient how viva leaves that out of his wittering about "legitimacy" and "representation", no? Simply, if you give in to the demands, the Lebanese government will be incapable of ever disarming Hezbollah, ridding itself properly of Syrian influence and will have no real independence whatsoever.

Jeez, that is so rambling and incoherent I literally cannot follow. You seem to be saying that prominent anti-Syrian figures are Syrian agents, and that corruption spread from Syrian influence - which is what you're demanding more of. Seriously, can anyone follow his rambling?

Or as I called it "tantamount to guesswork". He should write articles for the Lancet on Iraq.
 
 
Christ, the majority of this thread has been like two kids with downs poking each other in the eye.
 
 
I think he may be right. Michel Aoun is on Hezbollahs side. I don't know how much of the Christian population but he did win alot of seats in the christian areas of Lebanon. Hezbollah and Amal represent the majority of Shi'a. The Shi'a are the biggest sect in the country but how much I don't know. I do remember seeing a 36% - 40% range. So if we assume that is was 40% and the Sunnis and christians make up the 60% left. March 8 would need about 11% more to become the majority. Aoun got more then that on his side. So I would say it is safe to say that March 8 represent the majority of Lebanese but how much it Beats the March 14 is unkown.

How ever remember when Rafik died. The Hezbollah sponsored demonstration support for Syria GREATLY outnumbered the the March 14 protests. The only thing the March 14 could come up with was accusing Hezbollah of using illegal Syrian worker with out any evidence.

What ever is going on the the Cedar State. I really hope that it doesn't go has far has a civil war. That country has seen to much bloodshed and i am planning on visiting it this summer.

Its no speculation. You are living in denial by saying its speculation.

Its FACT that 40% of leb's population are shi'ites.
Its FACT that all of them support either hezbullah or amal coz there r no other shi'ite groups. Maybe 1 or 2% of them dont care but thats superficial.
its FACT that michael oun won half of the christian seats in parliament.

THEREFORE

the opposition has at least 55% of the population on their side NOT COUNTING other smaller parties which might have up to 10% of the population (ie, marada, sunni parties, etc).

Why do you hate the truth?
 
 
Is it really so hard to look at wikipedia? Your demography is largely right, I'll concede that much:

 
It is estimated that about 40% are Christians, 35% are Shia Muslims, 20% are Sunni Muslims and 5% are Druze [14].
 

However, the rest of your argument doesn't stand up since you ignore the constitutional framework within which a democratic government operates. A protest can't bring down a government as it is mandated to govern until the next elections.

That, and the resignation of the government and new elections is exactly what those who killed Pierre would have wanted. Then again, we all know you're about caving into terrorists Viva  
 
 
As I've said many times before "the opposition" having 50+% (whether they do or not) IS UTTERLY IRRELEVANT. The "opposition" have 60+% in Britain, that doesn't mean violent overthrow of the government is in any way democratic or legitimate. Viva is a tit.

You dont get it do you?

the government was built based on hezbullah and amal's support. If it didnt have their support it wouldnt have been existed in the first place. Since hezbullah and amal withdrew their support, it can no longer stand constitutionally because from the lebanese constitution:

Article 95(3)a:
The confessional groups are to be represented in a just and equitable fashion in the formation of the Cabinet

It's not ad hominem, I don't use personal attack INSTEAD of an argument, I use an insult in ADDITION TO a valid point. It's an insult, call it what it is. My point stands on tis own merits, whether or not I put an insult on the end.
And I don't do it "all the time", stop exaggerating. I find your consistent attempts to dismiss me with such distortions and assertions rather offensive. Earlier today you challenged my "honesty" because I apparently "misconstrued" what you said - this despite the fact that numerous times recently you have been guilty of the same sort of thing with regards to me.
And considering the joy you took in warning me over nothing a little while back (subsequently revoked after my complaint to the mods   ) I also take issue with your rather laughable claim that you "don't really like warning people". Maybe not "people", but you don't seem to mind warning me.

Exactly, so why add the insult to the end?! Your point is fine as it is. You don't see other people putting in insults in the end of an argument; mainly because it isn't a particularly appropriate way of debating. I don't think the judge would be too amused if you did it in court.

I've warned you twice in total (including the one that was removed). Considering the amount of personal attacks you dish out, I think I've been nice. Perhaps too nice.

The people have demonstrated that disapproval of the government and I am sure or at least hoping this gov will take actions to rectify it and should the people not be pleased with it then the next elections are the best place to settle. If they want a nice transition that is.

the government is in no way representative of the people.. not even HALF of them! i repeat.. if seniora didnt have the support of hezbullah and amal, he wouldnt have had his government this way because he doesnt have 2/3 of parliament to approve the government and now sicne hezbullah and amal have withdrawn their support, the government is now invalid and unconstitutional because it doesnt represent shi'ites and it doesnt have the support of 2/3 of parliament.
 
 
I have no knowledge of the Lebanese constitution but is it the case that if the government doesn't have 2/3 support then it is automatically dissolute. or simply that 2/3 have to approve for a new government to take power. Because if it is the latter then i am just going to repeat myself and say "wait for elections".
However if it is the first then, the government should by all means have quit(assuming what you said is true about the government not having 2/3).

Article 95(3)a:
The confessional groups are to be represented in a just and equitable fashion in the formation of the Cabinet

Since the shi'ites arent represented and they are the BIGGEST sect, then obviously the government is uncostitutional
 
 
They were represented in a just and equitable fashion when the Cabinet was formed. They chose to walk out. - That's the part of the story that he always leaves out. If any group can bring down the government simply by leaving the Cabinet, government in Lebanon would be impossible. Which is pretty much what he wants, seeing as he favours Syrian domination.
 
 
im not gonna bother readng jon's post, but once he said that shi'ites withdrew voluntarily. Even if they did, that still makes it unconstitutional because it does not respresent them. They withdrew for a reason: their view wasnt taken into account so that makes the government unconstitutional.

How can 40% of the population not have a say in the running of the country? its not even 40%, its 55% including the christians.
 
 
jon is just jealous because the group that raped his country's terrorists is winning major popular support in lebanon and the traitor government which his PM loves is falling down.
 
 
You should read Jon's post - he was agreeing with you - it may culture what us normal people call "healthy debate" - not that you'd be accustomed to such a practice.

What violent overthrow? So far the only violence has been the murder of an oppostion supporter by the pro government groups. Don't mention the murder of MPs has an example. No one knows who killed them and accusing the opposition is foolish.

If Hezbollah wanted to take out the government. Believe me they could. Hezbollah are better trained then the army. A large section of the army are Shiia. If Hezbollah attacked the government. The shiia would leave the army and the government would be RAPED by hezbollah.
 
 
theres so much bs in jon's argument..

first of all, britain isnt 60% opposition. If it was, then it wudve been reflected in the parliamentary elections recently.

Secondly, the government was made based on hezbullah and amal support and now that they dont support it, it hardly represents 1/3 of the population.

Thirdly, lebanon is a special case because the constitution and the national accord say that the government has to represent every sect but it doesnt represent shi'ites so its not constitutional.

Fourthly, the people have the right to demonstrate against a government whcih has failed them and has been the msotcorrupt in history.

64% at the last election, most likely MORE by now.

As you keep saying, making it sound as if the government chose to exclude Shi'ites or just wanted to violate the constitution. The fact that the Shi'ites LEFT VOLUNTARILY in order to destabilise the government seemingly passes you by.

There's absolutely no reason why he should. The whole country could protest against him, but until 5 years are up or there's a no-confidence vote, he's perfectly entitled to stay in power.
 
 
As a Lebanese person, this thread makes me want to... look for an emoti that shoots itself in the head. But I'll keep it simple.

First off-- beg to differ. I'm a shi'ite. Not a supporter of Amal or Hezbollah. And how could I put this simply.... I, umm, KNOW other shi'ites. Lots actually. Not supporters either. Love the fact that used the word FACT when saying that though.

And why is it seeming to me here that you feel that you're giving voice to Lebanon's 'majority'? You're not even Lebanese. It's embarassing.
Don't mean to be so harsh, but I know a lot of Lebanese people that would feel like banging their heads to the walls if they read your posts Viva. Try constructing an argument without a bunch of false statistics, and don't speak for me or any other Lebanese people that refuse to be spoken for in that manner.

Thanks.
