man i read the whole article, this comes as a real huge surprise to me, an ex-muslim running for US president ! hey then surelly we are not far from the day a grandson of OBL will do the same :wtf:, i can not figure out if am with or against his presidency, but it sure as hell a huge step, towards what only God knows.
 
 
@Drnaline,

OBAMA is NOT muslim. EOS

This play by Hillary is well thought out, she is attacking Obama because she knows either she (probably she) or HE will take the Democratic nomination, and if they are at eachothers throats, how FANTASTIC would it look if one or the other selects the other as there VP running mate. We have burried the hatchet and are on our way to working for a common good of the American people.

Who else did that recently.... THATS RIGHT John Kerry and John edwards had some tiffs while running, and then Kerry selects Edwards as his running mate.
 
 
@Drnaline,

When he attended a Madrassa he was down as a Muslim Student, it is a school where Muslims learn only the koran. I don't recall him recanting his religion and until he does he's a closet muslim. That's dangerous to those who believe in Democracy, his history is murky and nonexistant.
 
 
@Drnaline,

It's a crazy world. The Hildabeast will exploit this issue now, only to bury it when she needs Obama to be her Vice, to rake in the Black vote. She's the quintessential hypocrite.

That was a horse shit rumor that was debunked by both repubs and dems. He went to a school that was predominately Muslim nothing more. You go to school at Lamar in Houston teas it is predominately Catholic, does not make it a catholic school though.

Only in the convoluted thinking of Liberals could America's election to the White House of a former MUSLIM, at the precise moment when the country is at war with Terrorist Islam (approximately 200 million terrorists), make sense.

Every Muslim who tries to immigrate to the US should be diverted to Scotland, so you can care for him, in all your lofty humanitarianism. All headcutters should live in Scotland.

Nope it's a matter of public record that he lived in Indonisia for four years, sorry but the guys a closet Muslim. His old madrassa teacher verified it and I'm sure so would a check at the passport office. I don't trust him, but I'm not an American.

You only like him, Scoob, because you suspect he'll hurt America as one of its national leaders. The bottom line is that you like whatever is bad for my country. I do consider it a strange compliment, however, that you, a foreigner, are so obsessed with my country. You say almost nothing about yours, but comment enthusiastically and abundantly on mine. Ha. I think America is more important to you than either the UK or Scotland.

It might not even matter. He'll have problems in the religion department either way, his current religion isn't exactly tolerant and accepting, and the PC people wil probably just brush it off as insignificant and he'll lose to Hillary by a slightly wider margin.

lol yes bush the commander in chief,hardly turned up for his national gaurd duties,while kerry who also came from a wealthy priveledged family,and who could have also escaped having to go to vietnam,actually volunteered to go,yet bush was seen as this patriotic brave strong leader lol had trouble turning up for his national gaurd service.

Kerry is a weakling and political opportunist. His campaign was a tragic comedy. He stabbed his fellow vets in the back for political gain in the
'60s and '70s, and then tried to use them as a prop to win the Presidency in 2004. He's a frig'n snake in the grass. He'd pimp his own mother for personal gain.

Rug I don't need to read rep. propaganda in Canada we get the real story. If you want a closet Muslim running the US that's none of my business but remember the Koran: First lie and then use deceitful tactics and then kill them where they stand or is that slay them where they stand while their women and children become slaves of Islam. Frankly Hilary would look smashing in a Burka, I won't have to watch her lips move while she lies. Imagine the fun Billy Bob cigar can get upto if a Muslim runs the White House?

If they put Obamanation in the Whitehouse, being a muslim person, he will be assasinated, no doubt about it, the hardcore VETs who have died to protect our country from terrorist and preserve our freedoms will blow a fucking gasket if that happens. (what freedoms we still have)
The Americans in Iraq right now who come home incomplete in one way or another will have feelings of being stabbed in the back just like our boys in Vietnam if he gets in the office, people spitting on them and calling them baby killers. I know plenty of these guys living in the woods of Montana, they are on the edge all the time, locked and loaded 24 - 7.
What the hell are people thinking? That electing people of Islamic faith to rule or country will somehow repair the problem, like reverse racism or over compensation. Makes me wanna puke....! Man I feel really sick! Glad the old man is not here to see this.
The biggest combat training camp for muslims is in Indonesia, to assume that Obamanation was only learning the Quran while in attendance there would be reckless to say the least. They put guns in the hands of the boys at age 5 in camps like that. I will not be voting for anyone associated with the further distruction of America, thats how I see it.

i dont get it, what exactly do you oppose in the guy, is it just his background without even giving him enough credit to atleast go through his views and opinions, or are his views unacceptable to you because they come from a muslim mentality ? or what exactly?

are you fearing he might be hiding illwill towards the united states, and this is some super muslim conspiracy to take over the world and then declare the US as muslim land ?

hope thats not it, am already giggling

I oppose nothing in the guy, it is his background, and I will not go through his views and opinions. He is to me, an unexceptable candidate for the United States President or VP for that matter, or any other position down the line that could make him the Pres. due to death or illness.
It is not even the recent discovery that he attended a muslim school, his name alone was enough to know he is from a muslim background. Even if he wasn't, I would not consider him for pres. he is to young and he doesn't have what it takes to work with the middle class of America that makes our country function. I do believe he would be very successful amoung the lower class population, his looks are enough for some, they would vote for him even if he never spoke a word. Colon Powell I would give consideration to for pres. or VP. he is very well spoken, smart and he has been in the trenches with the people, he could indentify with the people on a broader spectrum.
There will be a black president at some point in time in the US, but I hope he will not be a muslim yet, to me it is a big slap in the face and to soon after 9/11. There will be exceptance of your people amoung us as now, much more so in the future, but not until your people change your human rights to meet the rest of the 1st world.
As for your people taking over the world and claiming America as your own, haahaa ha..I am laughing so hard about that one, you don't stand a snowballs chance in hell to pull that off, come to my door you'll be greeted bullets first in a take over situation. You can take what I got when you pry it from my cold dead hand.
When your people melt successfully into a western society, there is no more place for your way of life amoung us, you will have to make big changes amoung your culture to ever meet or compete with any western world country as an equal in power and world respect. When that happens then we can live together in peace.:peace:

Idiocy is similar to drug abuse....Idiots and drug addicts are the last ones to know that their lives are problematic. It's circular.
The idiots who voted for George Bush don't really know why they voted for him, only that they did. There was no valid reason for voting for him, precisely.
They despised the very idea of a Gore or a Kerry presidency, so much so, that they'd even vote a fellow idiot into office, to spite them. It's circular.
They rant and rave about liberalism, and decadence, and the decline of civilization (or preferred civilization,....gas guzzling SUV's in a fossil fuel depleted world, protectionism vs. globalization, the idea of stable money markets in light of the flux of supply vs. demand, etc....), while fiddling as Rome burns.

The fact of the matter is that the only way to leave Islam is through death. Obama was brought up Muslim - chose Catholicism later when the family returned to the US. Is this not correct that the only way out of Islam is death?
 
 
@Drnaline,

Yep according to the Koran that's the only way out. A great deal of his youthful past isn't available. Madrassa are Muslim Schools where only the Koran is tought, no three RRRs their. Just Allah, Allah, Allah, three years of Allahing isn't not a good thing. He's never publicly renounced Islam, nor will he and until he does swearing on the Bible he's a Muslim.

The scene at the end brought a tear to my eye and a pain to my groin.
