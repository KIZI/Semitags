Turkmen authorities have temporarily suspended the license of the country's most popular mobile operator that serves more than 2 million customers.

The Communications Ministry said the services of Russian-owned MTS would be unavailable for at least a month as of Tuesday.

MTS accounts for around four-fifths of the Central Asian nation's cellular subscribers.

The company said it has tried to clarify the reasons for the move but it has yet to receive an explanation from Turkmen officials.

Many households are heavily reliant on mobile communications in this authoritarian former Soviet state, where landline connections remain outdated and inefficient.
