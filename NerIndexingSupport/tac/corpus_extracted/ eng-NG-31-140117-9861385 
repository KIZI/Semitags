You still have meaningful baseball in October. You can go back to your
favorite pastime of rooting against the Yankees.

All you little Bitches can break out the Red Sox hats you bought in 04 and
pray that the Yankees don't win their 27th title or their 5th title since
the mets last won.

And if the Yankees loose then you can all do you little Bo Jangles tapdance
in the dugout just like Reyes, and Delgado used to do when things went well

I hope you little Bitches had a chance to cherish your moment of domation
this past may when you were beating Darrel Rasner and talking about owning
this town.

Don't worry little Bitches, you will always have the memory of advancing one
round further than the Yankees in 06. Its a shame they don't throw ticker
tape parades for winning a Division Series against the Dodgers
