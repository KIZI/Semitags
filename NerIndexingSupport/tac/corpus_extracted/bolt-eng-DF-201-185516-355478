This new audio tape about global warming and OBL is creating quite a buzz with conspiracy theorists.

A lot are posting the following links saying he died in December of 2001 and that of course the US government is still using him as a boogieman.

If they are, they're not the only ones. Al Qaeda is still "pretending" he's alive, too, by releasing these tapes.

(I suspect the reason they stopped doing video is because they realized the landscape could be used to determine their location.)

This sort of conspiracy theory "logic" amazes me. Its like they didn't even think it through (of course - we are talking about CTers - so they probably did not).

What would happen if it was revealed OBL was dead? What would change in US foreign policy? Absolutely nothing. None of the US foreign policy is currently related to catching OBL as its chief goal, and it never has been.
 
 
Interestingly his son says that when his father does die things are going to get really bad because currently he is a restraint to the men following him that want to do a lot of killing.

Yes, I was about to post the same thing.

Good read.

Maybe Obama actually is a CIA/MI6 asset after all...

I doubt it, OBLs' videos never contained much landscape, just a generic wall or a room that could be literarily anywhere. The location is fairly easy to conceal in a video and AQ isn't that stupid.

I think they stopped doing videos to hide Osama better. If he were seen twice a year on a video, chances of being recognized are much greater than if everyone just knows his image from a decade ago. It's also possible he shaved or such, again to make recognition much more difficult. Another possibility is that illness is taking hold, and they want to hide that, or a combination of the two.

Hm, interesting if true. Overall, though, that will be their downfall. Osama will die eventually, be it kidney failure, hellfire missile or old age, and they will go on a rampage - which will quickly reduce their appeal to zero. The best way to defeat militant Islam is to let it be itself.
Many innocent people will die of course, but that can't be helped.

Except all the videos of him walking around outside, of which there are several to choose from. Even with extensive analysis (of surrounding geology, wildlife, etc) these videos are incredibly difficult to pinpoint, if not impossible.

Doubtful given his strict Islamic beliefs. Although he would be allowed to dye his beard black during time of war.

Would this be the fabled "kidney disease" that the CTer's seem to think is real?
 
 
He has kidney disease like Zarqawi had a peg-leg.
 
 
Is the kidney disease story complete moonshine, or was there ever a grain of truth to it? I never looked into that in any detail.

I suppose the possibility that he's dead but Al Qaida wants to conceal that fact isn't so unlikely. The point about them possibly not wanting his present appearance to be too well known is well made, however.

The comedian Rich Hall did a bit about how a lot of Americans (in his experience) can't grasp that the fight isn't against a man but an idea. They've got this idea locked in their heads that taking out OBL will solve the whole problem. If that were the case, I can see how the CT would grow because "surely the US must be able to take out one man and call it a day, right?" The only explanation for the failure can be that America's leaders don't WANT him dead yet, never mind that that isn't the mission.

I fault the Bush Administration for that (surprise, surprise), and probably the media, too. They put too much emphasis on the man himself.
 
 
Reliable non-MSM websites inform me that OBL is like the arch vampire of terrorism and US Spec. For. carry sharpened stakes solely for the purposes of breaking into his mountain crypt and stabbing him in his necrosed heart, thereby ending terrorism forever.
 
 
off course he's dead, he was killed before 9/11 so he could be blamed
 
 
Confirming his death would be a major victory for the intelligence agencies.

I've also heard many analysts that believe he was killed in the Tora Bora airstrikes, but from what I understand the analysts that are actually still employed in the intelligence community are certain that he's still alive - he just went to one of the few places on the globe that is nearly impossible for the US Special Forces to operate with total efficiency - it negates most, if not all, of our strengths.

As to them 'keeping him alive' for propaganda/continued war effort purposes, bollocks. That argument may have held a tiny bit of water during the Bush administration, but it's doubly ridiculous now and completely without merit.

That's why I wondered if there was a possibility that Al Qaida was faking stuff up to make it seem as if he was still alive. However, I would imagine the intelligence guys on the ground probably have the right handle on it.

Thanks. In case you missed it, the point was that hiding his location probably isn't the reason not to make videos of Osama.

 
Doubtful given his strict Islamic beliefs. Although he would be allowed to dye his beard black during time of war.

 
We have seen Islamic beliefs stretched and changed to suit their leaders for a sufficiently long while now to make this a possibility.

 
Would this be the fabled "kidney disease" that the CTer's seem to think is real?

 
If you'd read what you quoted you'd find out that this kidney thing was just one possibility, and not the point at all.

You need to work on your reading comprehension, I think.

You were the one saying "OBLs' videos never contained much landscape", I was just pointing out that you were mistaken.

And I said it was "doubtful", which means not a certainty. And you have the brassneck to criticise other peoples comprehension!

 
If you'd read what you quoted you'd find out that this kidney thing was just one possibility, and not the point at all.

 
You mentioned an "illness" I was just wondering whether you meant his mythical kidney disease or something else, like Typhoid for example. No need to get into a lather about it. No-one was accusing you of being a Truther.

What a whiney little ashhat.

That's possible. However recall the appearance of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed when he was caught!

Radovan Karadić, and Sadam Hussein took the reverse step, of course.
 
 
In a 2007 interview with David Frost, Benazir Bhutto clearly says, "... Omar Sheik, the man who murdered Osama Bin Ladin..."

This is put forward by CT sites as a popular piece of evidence. At first I was suspicious, but she seems to clearly say this. It is also odd that David Frost does not pick her up on this.Can anyone shed any light on this? Did Bhutto really believe this or is there something I'm missing here?
The fact that she was murdered a few months later is adding plenty of grist to the conspiracy mill.

I'm not able to post URLs due to my newbieness, but if you google 'Bhutto Osama', the first youtube video that comes up has the quote at about 2:15.

Omar Sheikh had been in prison for the murder of Daniel Pearl for nearly five years when that interview was conducted. Do you really think Osama bin Laden was killed in a Pakistani prison by his comrade and ideological coreligionist? How did he get there? How could Benazir Bhutto, who hadn't been in the country for years and who was not exactly known for cavorting with terrorists, possibly know of it? Why would she mention this murder out of the blue when it has no logical connection to the rest of what she's saying? Why would she refer to Osama bin Ladin several times before and after this particular interview as a present threat?

Fine. I was mistaken about some videos about Osama. My point was, however, that pinpointing his location that way probably wasn't a reason they about discontinued his videos.

 
And I said it was "doubtful", which means not a certainty. And you have the brassneck to criticise other peoples comprehension!

 
Perhaps. Then again, KSM was also a fairly strict muslim, and he was shaven when caught. There is therefore precendens among his allies, so your "doubtful" comment is just a cheap shot.

 
You mentioned an "illness" I was just wondering whether you meant his mythical kidney disease or something else, like Typhoid for example. No need to get into a lather about it. No-one was accusing you of being a Truther.  

 
No, you were just being a prick, I understand

Thanks. It is good to get the context. I guess it was an unfortunate slip of the tongue by Bhutto, rather than anything significant. I thought it a bit strange.

Its like Hitler and the NAZIs. Shooting Hitler dead wouldn't eliminate Nazism overnight, but every member of the allied forces would have loved to have the shot.

Killing and capturing OBL won't solve anything, but letting the bad guy of the early 21st Century get away is simply bad PR.
 
 
For my money, the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed did far more to disrupt their ability to operate globally than if they'd bagged UBL and Al-Zawahiri.

UBL doesn't have the planning and logistics skill that people like KSM, Mugniyah, et al have.
 
 
Liver cancer is likely to kill you dead. OTOH, he's more valuable for both sides if he's alive. Solution? Crappy audio tapes!

This was covered in the recent BBC Conspiracy Fuiles programme. In the course of the interview, Butto was talking about Bin Laden, and also Daniel Pearl, and in one bizarre slip of the tongue/brain, she said "Osama Bin Laden" when from the wide r context it was clear she meant "Daniel Pearl." IIRC, the intreview may have originally gone out live, but subsequently the line was deleted, which naturally only bolsters the conspiracists in the belief that Bhutto had inadvertently spilled the beans.
 
 
From memory, the BBC programme also seemed to suggest in a throwaway line that the 'kidney disease/dialysis' line originally came from either Pakistani or Saudi intelligence (possibly both).
In addition it stated that, depite being at war, AQ and the Taliban followed some sort of Islamic religious custom in announcing publically the deaths of their comrades.

Tactically, you are totally correct.

But from a public relations standpoint, OBL was sold as the mastermind behind 9/11 before most Americans (myself included) had ever heard of KSM.
