A decision by Wells Fargo & Co. to shut down its Wells Fargo
Financial stores includes five in the Tampa Bay area and 34 in
Florida.

The stores, separate from community banks or mortgage centers,
offered nonprime portfolio mortgage loans that Wells Fargo will no
longer originate.

Other services will shift to other Wells Fargo businesses, along
with Wells Fargo Financial's nonstore employees. Each store employs
five to seven people, but job losses will depend on the market,
since some employees might be transferred, said Steve Carlson, a
spokesman for Wells Fargo.

"We'll continue to look for new positions for as many impacted
team members as possible," he said.

Nationwide, about 17 percent of those who work for Wells Fargo
Financial will lose their jobs  3,800 layoffs within the next 12
months.

The company says the 638 stores aren't necessary since its 2008
merger with Wachovia, which made it Florida's largest bank and gave
it a network of community banking centers in the state. The stores
will close within 60 days.

"The economics of a separate Wells Fargo Financial channel are
no longer viable, especially now that our customers have access to
the largest banking and mortgage store network in the United
States," said David Kvamme, president of Wells Fargo Financial.

The number of community banks and home mortgage stores won't
change, the company said. Wells Fargo Financial customers with FHA
home loans, auto loans and credit cards will be served by those
businesses.

Those weren't the only local bank layoffs announced this month.
Bank of America has filed a notice with the state to lay off 50
employees from 5301 W Idlewild Ave. in Tampa by the end of August.
