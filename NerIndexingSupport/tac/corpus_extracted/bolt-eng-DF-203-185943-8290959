The Biebs hands down. He doesn't seem as morally bankrupt and douchey as the rest.
 
 
I think I really would move to Canada - which providence has FL weather?
 
 
this poll makes me happy my husband has dual citizenship

I had to Google. Jose was Casey Anthony's lawyer and Amber Port whatever was a "Teen Mom."

Baez. He may be douchey but so are most politicians and he would be the most qualified.
But yeah, I'd move to Canada too.
 
 
Bieber has made some pretty asinine/naive political statements.
 
 
I voted for Amber Portwood because I have no idea who she is and wanted to emulate how many other Americans vote.

This assumes I know who all these people are....
 
 
Bieber's Canadian citizenship notwithstanding, he's the most impressionable. It would depend on his VP nom. He could be groomed from the inside, so his..odd..views could be molded. On the other hand, he could choose Karl Rove or somesuch to be his veep. Tricky, tricky...
 
 
Is it wrong that I only know who half of these people are or that of the two I do know I've never actually seen their shows or heard their songs - only pictures of them.
I cannot make an informed vote on this one
