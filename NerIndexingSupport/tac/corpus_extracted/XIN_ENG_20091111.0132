Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto Romulo said on Wednesday he is
confident that the country can still obtain additional grant from a U.S.
government aid agency to fund the government's poverty reduction programs.

Romulo said he is optimistic that the Philippines will retain its compact
eligible status and obtain full compact grant from the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC) in early 2010.

"The MCC has acknowledged that the Philippines is making significant headway in
combating corruption and we are optimistic that we will achieve our bid for a
full compact grant by next year, " Romulo said.

The Philippines stands to lose an additional 500-million-U.S.- dollar poverty
reduction funding from the MCC after it failed anew in the agency's latest
corruption index.

The Philippines, which qualified in 2007 under the MCC's threshold program
initially received 21 million U.S. dollars for the government's anti-corruption
projects.

The results of the corruption test will greatly impact on the decision of MCC
Board of Directors at their quarterly meeting scheduled for Dec. 9 when they
select eligible developing countries for compact funding.

But Romulo maintained that the MCC has consistently recognized the Philippines'
high capacity to be a compact partner.

"They have invested heavily to ensure that the Philippines develops a compact
program that will help reduce poverty through economic growth," he said.
