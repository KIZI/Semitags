In the post this morning I received my complimentary season ticket
for Lancaster City home matches in return for penning a page in their
programme. But to my surprise, i also got a complimentary ticket
which enables me to go into the boardroom for ALL matches as well! I
have been invited in there now and again in the past, but now it
seems I might be joining the prawn sandwich brigade every match!

I'll be going along to watch them play FC United of Manchester in the
Unibond League this coming Saturday, which more than likely will be
their highest attendance of the season - although you neve rknow!

Mike
