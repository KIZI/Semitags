Odds against Fins winning each of their next four games

Buffalo  8-1

Baltimore 3-1

New England  40-1

Cincinnati  5-2

Buffalo and NE are off the table. Buffalo is not great, but they still have
something to play for, at home, and they will. The Buffalo fans will be
there out for blood.

Baltimore is plainly a better team on talent, but they may have shot their
wad last night and things may be melting down between players and coaches
(of course the same may be true here). So long as the Fins don't quit first,
they have a shot at home.

Bengals are going nowhere, and will want to pack in and hit the golf course
on the long holiday weekend. So will the Fins, of course, but if it comes
down to this game, they will have a mighty motivation to avoid historic
infamy. Of course if they pull the donut they may seal Scam Cameron's fate,
so who knows how hard they play in that spot?

Overall, I make the odds about 2-1 in favor of the Fins going 0-16.

If the Fins beat the Pats next meeting, the NFL is rigged.

Barring serious injuries to Brady and company, there is NO WAY Miami beats
New England.

As you say, 0-16 is a good bet.
