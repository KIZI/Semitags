Russia's supreme court Thursday ordered a new trial of the suspects in the the
murder of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya after annulling acquittals
decided in February.

"The supreme court has annulled the innocent verdict in the case of the murder
of Anna Politkovskaya. The case will be examined again with new jurors," supreme
court spokesman Pavel Odintsov told AFP.

The quashing of the verdicts was the latest twist in a case that rights groups
say has been marked the total failure of the Russian authorities to bring
Politkovskaya's killers to justice.

Relatives of Politkovskaya condemned the decision, saying that a new trial was
not enough and that a completely new investigation into the murder of the
journalist, who was highly critical of the Kremlin, is needed.

None of the four suspects brought to trial had been charged with pulling the
trigger in the shooting nor with ordering the apparent contract killing of
Politkovskaya in her Moscow apartment building on October 7, 2006.

Murat Musayev, lawyer for one of the accused, slammed the supreme court decision
as "political" and "predictable".

"This was a political decision taken at the highest level. We will contest this
decision, but it is near fatalistic to do so in this country," Musayev told AFP.

"This decision was entirely predictable," he added. "In our country acquittal is
considered an ill that must be fought against, especially if the case in
question has wide resonance."

Politkovskaya family lawyer Anna Stavitskaya told AFP said: "We did not appeal
the acquittal verdict because we saw no basis to do so.

"We agreed with the jury. From the evidence they were presented, they could not
have decided differently."

"But the supreme court did not consider our opinion," she added. "We will demand
in preliminary hearings that the case be returned to prosecutors -- that is to
say that a new investigation be undertaken."

Of the suspects, Chechen brothers Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov had been
accused of acting as driver at the murder scene for the killer -- whom
prosecutors say is a third brother, Rustam, who is still at large.

Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, a former police investigator had been charged with
providing logistical assistance for the killing.

Pavel Ryaguzov, a former agent of the FSB security service, was not directly
accused of being part of the murder but of extortion in another aspect of the
case.

During hearings, the defence team pointed out that the suspects' DNA had not
been found on the weapon and that phone calls made by the accused at the time
did not prove their presence at the murder scene.

Despite lasting three months, the original trial also failed to shed any
significant light on the circumstances of the killing.

"Politkovskaya's children believe there was no proof of the guilt of these
people... but many questions remain about the case that were not even addressed
at the trial," Stavitskaya said.

Politkovskaya wrote dozens of articles for her Novaya Gazeta newspaper and a
book called "Putin's Russia," accusing Putin of using the Chechen conflict to
strangle democracy and detailing horrific rights abuses in Chechnya.

After her murder, Putin called for Politkovskaya's killers to be punished but
also described as "extremely insignificant" her ability to influence political
life in Russia.

The authorities' failure to find the killers had raised concerns that the
enemies of critical journalists were being able to act with impunity in Russia.

A young journalist working as an intern on the Novaya Gazeta, Anastasia
Baburova, was gunned down in central Moscow earlier this year as she emerged
from a news conference with a prominent rights lawyer.
