 Iran Placing Medium-Range Missiles in Venezuela; Can Reach the U.S. :: Hudson New York 

Iran is planning to place medium-range missiles on Venezuelan soil, based on western information sources[1], according to an article in the German daily, Die Welt, of November 25, 2010. According to the article, an agreement between the two countries was signed during the last visit o Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to Tehran on October19, 2010. The previously undisclosed contract provides for the establishment of a jointly operated military base in Venezuela, and the joint development of ground-to-ground missiles.

How far will medium range missiles travel? About a thousand miles.

How far is Miami from Venezuela? About 1300 miles.

Concerned? Yes. Terrified? No.

I believe there are some that can travel about 2000 miles.

No need to be terrified - yet.

But when Iran has nukes and longer range missiles you definately don't want them in Venezuela.

Absolutely. It needs to be dealt with, but it is no reason to ramp up the war talk. We will not be well served by invading Venezuela.

That kind of stuff goes on all the time, There is always a crisis brewing somewhere. Ramping up the fear factor serves no purpose but the purpose of increased ratings for Fox News.
 
 
They don't have to hit anything in particular. Radioactive material lobbed on to US soil would spark paranoia and poison crop land and waterways, or the EMP from a crude nuke detonated in the atmosphere could shut down power grids for weeks across the south without breaking a single pane of glass.

But I doubt they would bother deploying a missile all the way to Venezuela if they didn't think it could hit us.

Why sure we would! We wouldn't want to be percieved as the planet's bully, after all, Bush is gone now and we want everyone to like us and have us on their BFF list.
The US had it's window of opportunity with Iran and did nothing, why would they try and play catch-up now?

They were going to put a missile shield in Eastern Europe. Russian didn't like it. They don't think anybody has a right to protect themselves from nukes - especially not their nukes.

According to the report they are not talking about missile shields in Venezuela.
They are talking about medium range surface to surface missiles that could reach the US.

Apparently the story first appeared in a German newspaper.

I ask again, wheres the problem? Why dont you blame Venezuella? LOL

Back in the bad ol' days of the Cold War, the US had missle bases - Atlas? Nukes? - in Turkey, as memory serves. That was one of the quid-pro-quos of the end of the Cuban Missle Crisis - the Soviets withdrew their tactical nukes from Cuba, and - after a decent interval - the US withdrew its ballistic, possibly nuke missles from Turkey.

& of course, the US had - & still has - strategic bomber bases in England & various air bases in Germany, Italy, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Qatar - I wouldn't be surprised if we could TDY surge bombers from Iraq, Afghanistan.

Israel is eager for us to establish arms depots & field troops (& nuke bombers?) from the IDF homeland. So far, we're resisting that.

No surprise at all. Chavez and Ahmadinejad have been hugging and kissing for quite some time. A few months ago they announced that they intended to create a "new world order".

Why cant China have Missiles and Missile Shields on Canadian land if Canada allows them.

They have to keep an eye on North Korea no?
