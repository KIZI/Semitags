The Islamic burka is "not welcome" in France because it is not a symbol of
religion but a sign of subservience for women, President Nicolas Sarkozy said
Monday.

"The burka is not a sign of religion, it is a sign of subservience," he told
lawmakers. "It will not be welcome on the territory of the French republic."

A group of French lawmakers has been calling for a special inquiry into whether
Muslim women who cover themselves fully in public undermine French secularism
and women's rights.
