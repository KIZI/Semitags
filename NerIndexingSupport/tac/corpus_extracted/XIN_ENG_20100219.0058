Rice prices in the global market for 2010 are likely to increase due mainly to
lower crop production resulting from natural disasters, said Vichak Visetnoi,
Director- General of the Department of Foreign Trade (DFT), a state- owned media
reported Friday.

As externally the rice supply is falling, but on the demand side it is seen
continuously rising, hence many foreign countries are expected to import more
rice, the National News Bureau of Thailand (NNT) under the state-owned Public
Relations Department, quoted Vichak as saying.

Planned bids for rice imports in March, 2010, by the Philippines will be another
factor, which will boost the global price of rice, he said.

Vichak disclosed that during Jan. 1 to Feb. 17, 2010, some 1.11 million tons of
Thai rice, worth of 694 million U.S. dollars, were exported by Thailand.

Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter.
