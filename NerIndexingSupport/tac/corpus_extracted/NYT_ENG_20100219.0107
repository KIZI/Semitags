As the FBI led a criminal inquiry into the plane
crash on Friday, searching for evidence through burned rubble wet
from overnight rains and working to identify two bodies, a portrait
of A. Joseph Stack III emerged as a companionable family man
unrecognizable from the diatribe posted online in his name.

His final act, a fireballing crash that killed an Internal
Revenue Service worker believed to be Vernon Hunter, 67, and
seriously injured two others, was the most spectacular crime here
in a generation, since the former Marine Charles Whitman shot 44
people from the University of Texas Tower in 1966.

In an autobiographical airing of grievances posted to a Web site
he controlled, Stack, 53, railed against a local accountant, Bill
Ross, who responded with his own statement on Friday, saying Stack
had attracted auditors by lying about his income.

Stack also assailed big business, politicians and tax policies
that limited the entrepreneurial prospects of computer software
engineers.

On the music scene, Stack registered as a workaday bassist, a
valuable commodity in a town of frontmen and lead guitars. When
taxes came up in conversation, his tone seemed no more strident
than the usual April 15th blues.

"He was a competent bass player," bandleader Billy Eli
recalled. "He did what we needed. He was easy to get along with.
He didn't have any ego."

After a few years, Stack dropped out of the band. Eli was
booking more extensive touring dates, and Stack was acquiring new
responsibilities.

On July 8, 2007, Stack married the former Sheryl Housh, a
divorced piano instructor. Stack doted on his new wife and her
12-year-old daughter, friends and relatives said. They lived in a
two-story red brick house in North Austin, making little impression
on neighbors. Stack kept his fixed-wing single-engine Piper
PA-28-236 Dakota at Georgetown Municipal Airport, about 24 miles
north of the city.

After his marriage, Stack largely withdrew from the music scene.
At family gatherings he maintained appearances. He told few besides
his wife of a simmering anger for which, he wrote, "there isn't
enough therapy in the world."

In the end he set the family home on fire, took off in his plane
and concluded that violence was indeed the answer to his troubled
mind. "I spent my entire life," Stack wrote, "trying to believe
it wasn't so."
