When the Hokies play Boise State at FedEx field to kick off next
season, will the whole stadium just implode into a vortex of agony
when you put the two ugliest uniforms in Division I-A on the field at
the same time?

(I say this knowing that Va. Tech will probably wear the orange
jerseys with the maroon panels that they wore last year against
Georgia Tech. http://tinyurl.com/nbcyzc )

How dare you ignore the freaks of nature that Phil Knight requires the
poor Oregon Ducks to wear around the stinkin' Nike swoosh?

They are uniform. Each of the eighty combinations are uniformly
horrendous since at no time, do they remotely resemble something someone
would want to wear.

I give Phil Knight credit. He's made the Oregon Ducks the Detroit Lions
of uniforms. After all, like the Lions, you'd think he'd have created
something remotely fashion worthy like the blind squirrel and the acorn,
but Phil succeeded in preventing that from ever happening.
