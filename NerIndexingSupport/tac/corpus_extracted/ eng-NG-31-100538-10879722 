Hi folks,

I've just ordered a part at German, Swedish & French, paid the bill (part
£9*, shipping £5, doh), now it's a bit too late for the silly question, but
: has anyone ever ordered (or bought in-shop) at GSF, were you happy with
that ?

* The part I need is a winscreen washer pump, mine's packed in... The only
price I found in France was over 30EUR (£20). Not feeling like going to Pug
or a scrapyard, and the stores are all closed when I'm back from work.

Cheers,
