 
 
Why is the Queen going to Ireland when it's causing so much trouble?
 
 
So far there's been a coded bomb warning in London and a viable explosive device found and disarmed in Maynooth near Dublin. So why is the Queen still going there? People could end up being killed all for the sake of a fairly pointless PR exercise, which if anything seems to be stirring up trouble rather than improving British-Irish relations.
 
 
We can't live apart forever. Ireland is our closest trading partner, our closest cultural partner in Europe, our only physical neighbour and a part of the world that we have shared thousands of years of history with; people from both nations receive extraordinary privileges in the other, so an Irish citizen can vote in British elections freely, for example. Ireland is still represented in our flag! Sooner or later we both have to put the past behind us and embrace peace and friendship.

Nothing will happen. Between the British and Irish intelligence services and 8,000 Gardai on the streets of Dublin, wannabe provos aren't going to have either the guts or the means to do anything. Their opinions about Britain are a tiny minority these days.
 
 
 
Hopefully the old cow will get blown to pieces, that'll teach the leeching monarchy not to go where they're not welcome.

 

Except that a comfortable majority of Irish people in the polls are at the very least happy with the Queen visiting.

Eejit.

No, the majority of Irish people are sick of ****ing terrorists planting bombs all over the place.

We have a friendly relationship with France despite a millennium of relatively constant war, we have a friendly relationship with Germany despite bombing Dresden to crap and the Luftwaffe annihilating Coventry and East London; hell our friendliest relationship is with a nation that rebelled against our rule two centuries ago. I am not trying to justify English or later British actions in Ireland over the years, but the past belongs in the past and whilst it should be remembered it should not be a barrier to our future together.

Britain and Ireland are going to have to find a path forward, and this is a good first step.

Britain doesn't still occupy part of France though does it? A ex-member of the SS isn't conducting a state visit to England are they?

1. The monarchy is purely ceremonial and has been since before the Act of Union with Ireland. The monarchy's last real interference in Ireland was in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution more than 300 years ago; after we became a constitutional monarchy, blame for any action in Ireland lies at the feet of British politicians. The SS committed atrocities on people who are still alive, in an organised and quite deliberate campaign to exterminate certain groups of society, and it is an insult to the dead of the holocaust to even begin to compare it with the monarchy.

2.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands  - relics from the Duchy of Normandy, which was almost but not entirely subsumed into France after the Angevin Empire collapsed. They never managed to take the Channel Islands away from us, mostly because the islands have been culturally distinct from even the rest of Normandy, let alone wider France, for quite some time.

I'm not even Irish you knuckle dragging retard. And if you call murdering innocent people including woman and children as "getting one over" you're a moral vacuum.

They do, actually. The Channel Islands are considered by some Far-Right Frenchmen to be rightfully part of France, a small minority of nutters hasn't hurt our relationship. Most Republicans in Northern Ireland have rejected violence and there are still a sizable number of Unionists in the country, revanchist ideologies are so 1990s. Not to mention the time I went cruising around Ireland earlier this year I found that no one I met honestly cared about Northern Ireland until you get right up into the border counties and even then it's only a priority for people once you cross the border into Northern Ireland itself. There's a reason that even under the more proportional system of Ireland's STV elections to the Dail that Sinn Feinn is very much an opposition party smaller than our Liberal Democrats. On the second point, it would be more like the son of an SS member who has been elected President of Germany conducting a state visit to England. Would we condemn his entire bloodline for his ancestor's actions? While I'm a Republican in the British Republic sense I don't think it's fair to blame Mrs Windsor for her Parent's actions.

158,000 people shared between the two Bailiwicks? That's bigger than a lot of small countries - if it was part of Ireland it would be like adding another Cork, so don't disparage them because of their small size. The islands also punch well above their economic weight. The fact remains that they are considered part of France in many respects by a lot of hardline right-wing French people - this is because of their cultural importance (they remain one of the few places in Normandy where Norman dialects are spoken) and historical importance to France, irrespective of their size.

Don't slag off a place you know feck all about.

Look, if you're so determined / desperate to fight for no good reason, get yourself out to Afghanistan: the British Army could use some canon-fodder to use on the natives.

Also, if we, the British as a nation, must bear the guilt for "murdering" those Irish who were directly or indirectly involved in (or even responsible for) The Troubles, you must bear a similar amount of guilt for all those innocent and uninvolved civilians on the British mainland murdered by Republican bombs. Are you prepared to count yourself guilty?

So? The Plantagenets actually gained control over Ireland beginning in the 12th Century through their relationships to the Norman Lords of Ireland. We have had an "on-off" relationship as it's stewards, rulers or otherwise for a millennium, more or less.

When was the last time the British committed acts of terror like this in the Channel Islands?

The only way Britain and Ireland will ever have an amicable relationship is when England ends its occupation of Celtic lands. A visit from a pompous old woman who, for many, represents imperialism and oppression is only going to make matters worse.
 
 
I get annoyed about the idea that Britain WANTS northern ireland.

We Dont!

We gave them a referendum with the hope they'd say no! We offered them to ireland during WW2 for a couple of ports that could be used for strategic purposes, Ireland said no!

We are stuck with them because they keep choosing to remain British.

The concept that purely because majority of ireland might decide that Ireland has to be united when the people of northern ireland keep choosing to remain in the union is just as tyrannical and authoritarian as what they were fighting against.

Freedom means having choices. Northern ireland had the choice to join a united ireland or remain in the union. They chose us. Thats all that matters

We'd be occupying if the populace of Northern Ireland, as a whole, didn't want us there. They want to be part of the Union, Britain has tried to give up Northern Ireland several times from World War II to the 1949 Ireland Act and the 1973 Northern Ireland Referendum (which got 98.9% in support of those who turned out and 57.5% of the entire Northern Irish population's support). Hell, the recent Belfast (Good Friday) agreement reaffirmed that Northern Ireland will change over to the Republic of Ireland if the people of northern Ireland want it - even the Republic of Ireland has changed it's constitution to agree with this as it no longer claims sovereignty over the Island of Ireland. Opinion polls in the rest of Britain during 1973 actually showed that, by a slim majority, the British Public wanted to give up Northern Ireland but there was no formal referendum held outside of Northern Ireland.

This isn't to say British Armed Forces and Police were justified in the specific crimes committed against Republican Communities but neither were the Republican Armed Forces - they tried to impose their minority viewpoint on the rest of Northern Ireland by force.
 
 
 

Because she is a G.

This is because many of the people voting to remain in the union are protestant settlers, a hangover from British colonialism. The referendum excluded a lot of people on border counties that would have voted in favour of a united Ireland. It was essentially designed to ensure a victory for unionists.

They took the entirety of Northern Ireland as part of the poll, it was an issue for Northern Ireland to settle as they were the ones actually living there and not the Republic of Ireland (even those in the 'border' counties!). The Republicans chose to boycott it but even if they hadn't the number of people who voted for, including 25% of Catholics who voted, was still in a clear majority of 57.5% of the entire population so even if every single one of them came to vote and voted no they still would have lost the election! You might as well give the Spanish or the Argentinians who live near the border of the area to the vote when deciding whether or not to keep Gibraltar and the Falklands respectively, their populations want to remain with Great Britain but the Spanish/Argentine want them as part of their respective nations. The Republic of Ireland has long supported the political process over the violence.

In the more recent Belfast Agreement Referendum which had much better turnout at 81.1% AND had the Republic of Ireland taking part 71.1% voted in favour of the agreement in Northern Ireland while at the same time a simultaneous referendum held in Republic of Ireland got an even higher 94.4% agreement - they were agreeing to change their constitution to remove their claim over Northern Ireland as sovereign territory. Think about that, 94.4% of the IRISH electorate voted to remove their claim over Northern Ireland.

And what do you want to do - rip away these people from the only homes they have ever known and send them back to what is supposedly their 'native' homeland? Sounds a lot like BNP's viewpoint on immigrants in the UK. These are tenth, twentieth generation immigrants and a good number of them will likely never even step foot in the island of Great Britain beyond being a tourist or know a home beyond Northern Ireland. A good chunk of the Republic of Ireland's population are settlers, some of the early settlers even came to consider themselves fully Irish and fought against the later insertions of the later Brits!

What's my point here? The People of Northern Ireland want to remain part of the Union, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland doesn't care to force the issue either way and agree that it is up to the people of Northern Ireland to decide. The United Kingdom has attempted to give over the six counties several times but the Republic of Ireland have consistently refused.
 
 
It's good the queen is going over, firstly all of the 'past problems' were the result of the British government and Irish terrorist groups, the monarchy did not control the army in bloody sunday etc and dont forget when Scotland and England joined in 1707, Ireland practically begged to be part of the union at that time.

To be fair, a lot of the border counties population was excluded, mostly because they were on the Republic side of the border.

The border is arbitrary, why should somebody 100m further south not have a say when the outcome affects them just as much? The Falklands are completely different because they are culturally distinct and geographically isolated. Whether or not Malvinas is Argentinian would have little affect on citizens hundreds of miles away on the mainland.

They only agreed to this on the condition that Britain agreed to allow NI to become a part of Ireland if the citizens of NI voted to do so in a referendum. It was a compromise, not a political statement.

That's not what I'm saying at all. I was trying to foreground the unfairness of not giving Irish citizens living in border counties a voice.
 
 
Chucklefiend, that's a slippery slope you're advocating there. If you include the border territories, why not the whole of Ireland? If you include the whole of Ireland, why not the whole of the UK?

In the upcoming Scottish referendum on independence, should the referendum remit be extended to include Durham, Carlisle, and Newcastle?
 
 
There is no clear reason as to why the Queen is visiting Ireland, it won't improve any relations between Ireland and Britain I would imagine.
 
 
 
We'd be occupying if the populace of Northern Ireland, as a whole, didn't want us there.

 

Formally speaking, we wouldn't. As Northern Ireland is governed civilly as part of the UK, it'd simply be another part of our country, not some sort of occupied territory. Support for the state in a small part has no impact on whether a state's control is 'occupation' or not.

Welcome to international relations. All borders are arbitrary.

 
Why would it do that? Most of Britain doesn't want NI. It would save us a lot of time, money and effort to let the Republicans have it but we can't give it away.

 

Most of Britain are fairly ignorant, couldn't give less of a damn about any sort of principles or idealism and really aren't worth listening to. In general, the only real political analysis you'll get from the average Briton is moaning about MPs expenses and naive comments about criminal justice.
 
 
I barely understand why we bother holding on to Northern Ireland. Frankly its a massive ****ing headache for us.

It's not really about ethnicity, it's about religion. The protestants will always vote against a united Ireland because Ireland is a Catholic country. A lot of the border counties are predominantly Catholic and would have probably voted for a united Ireland, but they were denied a vote.

One of the worst 'atrocities' that occurred in Ireland at the hands of we English was in 1599. Elizabeth I sent the Earl of Essex to invade and was despondent over the way he conducted it. She said that she had sent a wolf to govern sheep or that she was a shepherd with no flock, some sort of analogy like that, and so I think you'll find that it's not usually the monarchs who were responsible for it.

If you love Republicans so much, remember Oliver Cromwell? Drogheda?

Because they are in a different country. That's like suggesting that the people living in the north of England should get to vote in Scottish elections.
 
 
 
I think they did one and NI wants to stay part of the UK.

 

That was a long time ago though wasn't it and only won by a small margin? A fresh referendum would be best imo, if it wins by a landslide then there can't really be any question as to what the people of NI want.

Yes but as I said, that referendum happened in the 70s and only 1% of Catholics voted in that so it's hardly a valid representation of what the people in NI want.
 
 
The Queen's visit to Ireland isn't a huge deal and nor should it be. She has visited countless different countries across the world and to visit our closest neighbour shouldn't be anything to shout about. The Queen having not been able to go to Ireland in her entire life is what is outrageous. This is symbolically a return to a normal and friendly relationship between the countries.

I've just told you that most of Britain wants what you want and you say that makes them "fairly ignorant." I'm tempted to agree with you, if only to put some sort of damper on your uninformed whingeing.

You won't get the sort of "political analysis" that you would like from most Brits because politics in Britain has long since moved away from believing their most important tool to be the gun.

Except that the result meant 57% of people overall in Ireland wanted to remain a part, so even if 100% of Catholics had voted it wouldn't have made a difference..

Also we can't just have hundreds of referenda, they have to be representative over a fairly large timescale.

Yes but the demographic may have changed since which would affect the result today. I think 40 years is a long enough timescale. One in 2013 would probably be appropriate.

You have every right to that belief, unsubstantiated though it be.

 
I'm not sure what relevance personal attacks have to my point though.
 

Well, if you don't like personal attacks, you shouldn't have called me ignorant.

 
Pardon me?
 

Granted. The point I was making is that politics in Britain is virtually never settled by violence which means that it doesn't elicit so much fear. The fact that there is a much wider range of political topics vying for equal attention means that political opinions tend to be more diffuse. That doesn't mean that Brits don't care about politics, they care a lot.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norther...ferendum,_1973 

99% for staying with the UK. Although the referendum sees slightl flawed and it was a long time ago. But I wonder how much things have changed
 
 
 
Yes but as I said, that referendum happened in the 70s and only 1% of Catholics voted in that so it's hardly a valid representation of what the people in NI want.

 

The 70s referendum still had 57.5% out of the whole population, not just those who chose to vote, vote to stay in. Not to mention 25% of the Catholics who did vote voted for yes.

 
It's not really about ethnicity, it's about religion. The protestants will always vote against a united Ireland because Ireland is a Catholic country. A lot of the border counties are predominantly Catholic and would have probably voted for a united Ireland, but they were denied a vote.

 

In the 70s election 1/4 of the Catholics who voted chose to stay in the Union. Not to mention that the border counties aren't part of Northern Ireland, they're already part of the Republic, why should they get a say in that? If you're extending the privilege to the border counties why not to the entirety of Ireland? Why not to the entirety of Great Britain? Why not get all of Europe involved? They'll be about as affected as those on the border.

 
The border is arbitrary, why should somebody 100m further south not have a say when the outcome affects them just as much? The Falklands are completely different because they are culturally distinct and geographically isolated. Whether or not Malvinas is Argentinian would have little affect on citizens hundreds of miles away on the mainland.

 

What about Gibraltar? Buggers are right next door to it. And it wouldn't really affect the people 100m further south - they already live in the Republic and enjoy easy travel to and from Northern Ireland and can cross the border with impunity, if they get a residence in the UK they can even vote for our MPs.

 
They only agreed to this on the condition that Britain agreed to allow NI to become a part of Ireland if the citizens of NI voted to do so in a referendum. It was a compromise, not a political statement.
 

No they didn't. Ever since the Ireland Act of 1949 this has ALWAYS been British Policy and is on the Statute Books - if the Northern Irish want to rejoin the Republic of Ireland they are perfectly allowed to. The Good Friday Agreement merely reaffirmed it, and set up a political process by which to do so. The people of the Republic of Ireland does not feel that the Northern Irish question is an important one at the moment and that's why they abandoned their claims on Northern Ireland - they've moved on beyond geographic and ethnic nationalism, beyond the revanchist mutterings of the troubles.

 
That's not what I'm saying at all. I was trying to foreground the unfairness of not giving Irish citizens living in border counties a voice.
 

But it isn't unfair. It isn't really their problem, they're not Northern Irish. They're not the ones who will suddenly move to a new country - no matter which way any referendum goes their lives will mostly be the same. They'll still be able to easily enter Northern Ireland, to go into Belfast, pay the same taxes, have the same passports, elect the same representatives.

As a final note I'd like to ask what's your angle in all this? Why are you such a vocal supporter of Irish Republicanism? Most of the Irish from Ireland really aren't big on Northern Ireland Revanchist thoughts from my experiences of Ireland. For that matter have you even been to Ireland? To the border counties? To Northern Ireland? Travelled to (London)derry and met the locals? To Belfast? To Cork? To Dublin?

The Irish have moved past this stuff a long time ago, beyond a few angry IRA members. Even Sinn Feinn are in on this whole political process.
 
 
 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norther...ferendum,_1973 

99% for staying with the UK. Although the referendum sees slightl flawed and it was a long time ago. But I wonder how much things have changed

 

Yes but I'd like to see a valid referendum which wasn't boycotted by the Catholic population. If everyone voted the results would have most likely been a marginal victory for staying within the UK. If the proportion of Catholics has risen since 1973 this figure may have fallen since.
 
 
 
1. The monarchy is purely ceremonial and has been since before the Act of Union with Ireland. The monarchy's last real interference in Ireland was in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution more than 300 years ago; after we became a constitutional monarchy, blame for any action in Ireland lies at the feet of British politicians.

2.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands  - relics from the Duchy of Normandy, which was almost but not entirely subsumed into France after the Angevin Empire collapsed. They never managed to take the Channel Islands away from us, mostly because the islands have been culturally distinct from even the rest of Normandy, let alone wider France, for quite some time.

 

Not true. The monarchy used its power to delay the Catholic emancipation act, which subsequently didn't get put through for a number of years. This was sometime around 1800 i can't remember the exact date.

Yes, that was actually a big thing. The Monarchy blocked the Catholic Emancipation Act. Oddly enough the promise of the Catholic Emancipation Act (before it was blocked) was one of the main incentives for them to join the Kingdom of Great Britain.

As already pointed out many times in the thread, the boycott did not make a difference.
57.5% percent of the whole population voted to stay part of the UK. That is a majority of people, no matter who didn't voted or whatever.

Plus, you can just keep having constant referendums. If there is another one, and people still want to be part of the UK, would you simply just ask for another one? And keep doing that forever unless the vote changes?

As I said, it was almost 40 years ago. If the demographics have changed since then, i.e. if Catholics now make up the majority in NI then the outcome is likely to have been different. A referendum in 2013 wouldn't be unreasonable given the last one was in 1973.

It actually doesn't matter which "religion" is the majority. People still cling to the "all Catholics are strict Nationalists and all Protestants are strict Unionists" idea. They are wrong.

In 2003, there was a survey done showing only 54% of Catholics in Northern Ireland are nationalists, 3% were Unionists, 42% were neither and 2% didn't know. There are some Protestant Nationalists, but they are few and far between, with almost 70% being Unionists. The vast majority of surveys (I would say every single one, but then again, not all statistics are done correctly) since the 1973 referendum have shown that the majority of Northern Irish people want to remain part of the UK.

Outside Northern Ireland, things are a bit different - UK mainland surveys consistently show a (albeit sometimes slight) majority in favour of a United Ireland. Irish surveys show the majority want a United Ireland, however, as of the Belfast Agreement and the referendum in Ireland following it, Irish voters relinquished their "claim" to Northern Ireland, instead leaving it up to the Northern Irish voters in a future referendum.

Then again, when I went to Uni in England, 90% of my friends were actually clueless about Northern Ireland. I remember one of my first conversations when I moved into halls when I said I was from Belfast and their question was "Have you gotten used to using Pounds instead of Euros?"   I don't think I want my nationality decided my people like that  

Adding to that, things have really changed since the Belfast Agreement (anyone around my age especially will tell you that). Now everyone in Northern Ireland is officially (in both UK and Ireland) a dual citizen - we can have two passports, travel and live in Ireland freely (although all UK citizens can, but the odd border patrol men I see when I go to Dublin don't even ask for ID if you're from the North, but they have done with English people I've been with   ). I live in Dublin half the year and Belfast (where I grew up, as a Protestant) the other half, and sometimes I laugh to myself about all of this still. Ireland and the UK are so very very alike, the only thing you notice is that you now drive in kmph, see Irish on signs and use Euros (if even, lots of shops take both currencies both sides of the border). Most young people, the new generation both sides of the border, truly, truly are completely indifferent about the whole British/Irish history. It's the older generation and those that lived during the troubles or had family involved in them that have an opinion.
 
 
So she use the power of the sceptre to blast it over to the middle east where it belongs, then they can squabble about religion and who owns what land with the other terrorists.
 
 
 
So far there's been a coded bomb warning in London and a viable explosive device found and disarmed in Maynooth near Dublin. So why is the Queen still going there? People could end up being killed all for the sake of a fairly pointless PR exercise, which if anything seems to be stirring up trouble rather than improving British-Irish relations.

 

Yes, lets give in to the minority if they threaten violence to achieve their goals. This exersise is so much more than PR, perhaps you should look into the history a bit more.

Well, Protestants seem to have made rather more of a name for themselves in the Irish Nationalist/Republican movement than Roman Catholics have amongst Unionism.

Very true.

Not true. People born in Northern Ireland are entitled to become Irish citizens, but they're not automatically so. They are, automatically, British citizens though.
 
 
I never really got why the Irish hate the Queen so much
 
 
 
I never really got why the Irish hate the Queen so much

 

Well it goes back to this guy called Diarmuid who ran off with another guys wife then lost his lands and called on some English mercenaries to come over promising them all sorts of stuff that wasn't his to give away. And when they came over they decided they liked it so much they were going to stay and this English Pope announced that the Irish were all savages so it was all cool and the gang for the English Kings to be Lords of Ireland. And then there was this English king, Henry - you might have heard of him? Well, he was another man who was mad for the ride which somehow ended up with him leaving the One True Faith and becoming a Prod. But the Irish (both the Old Irish and the Old English), they still liked Latin and men in dresses which meant that they were suddenly traitors. And the ones who came after Henry were kids of divorce so they were a bit messed up and took it out on Ireland. They decided to set up a perfect English society in Ireland and started comparing Catholics to Native Americans to make it more ok to kick them off their land, send them to Barbados or kill them.

So these Plantations and the Penal Laws led to a situation called the Protestant Ascendancy where Anglicans (10% of the population) were the ones in charge and Presbyterians (10%) and Catholics (80%) were discriminated against. After seeing the English get kicked out of America and the monarchs get killed in France some Irish people started thinking and set up the United Irishmen. They had a rebellion in 1798 but it resulted in the Act of Union (1801) where Ireland became part of the United Kingdom and lost its parliament.

Anyway, I'm sure you've heard some of the rest on the news. Ireland had a Rising in 1916 which led to a War of Independence (and then a civil war   ) in 1919-21. And at that point there was partition. Instead of one state where everyone was forced into pluralism there were two states. One with a Catholic majority and the other with a Protestant one. Now the catholic state wasn't any great shakes but the Northern state was completely discriminatory - jobs, housing, voting, everything. Yet it kept being supported by Britain. And then there were the Troubles.  

Now, over all those years Britain changed a lot. But it kept its monarchy. So whether its people being pissed off at the way their parents were treated up North or when they lived in Britain or whether they're just generally annoyed about the whole thing it makes sense to look for a figurehead that's been there the whole way through.

That and most Irish people dislike the idea of monarchy.
 
 
Makes me laugh some people r so bitter...if they don't keep up with the repayments on the money we give them (weres the thanks??)their wee country will have to be reposed !!now what could we get at auction for that??100 bags of potatoes

Harsh. But I think I'd settle for the right to force Dublin to take back Ulster. I don't want to see the United Kingdom broken up but the UK would be a better place without the Irish.

I'm aware of the history. It is precisely because of the history that a British monarch should not, in my opinion, be going to Ireland. To many Irish people, the monarchy is the one constant that has been at the center of the British oppression of the Celtic people. Politicians come and go but the royal family has been there throughout all the conflict and suffering; from the aftermath of the glorious revolution and the delaying of the emancipation act, to 'the troubles' and Bloody Sunday. If we wanted to create a new relationship with Ireland, one based on an equal footing and mutual respect, we should have sent the prime minister rather than figurehead associated with so many bad memories in the minds of the Irish people.

It is my understanding that the prime minister will be going (see  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13434653  ). The fact that both the head of state and the head of government will be there shows, I believe, that at least the Brits are serious about moving on and doing something constructive, even if the Irish (or at least some of them) would prefer to carry on living in the past.

**** off you self-righteous little prick. You can take your presumptions and stick em where you evidently believe the sun shines from.  

Out of curiosity, what would you call it? The 'Penal Laws' for example, designed by the Anglican ruling class and applied by English Monarchs to disadvantage Catholics. What would you describe them as? Here's how Edmund Burke described them “a machine of wise and elaborate contrivance, as well fitted for the oppression, impoverishment and degradation of a people, and the debasement in them of human nature itself, as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man.”

Edit: This 'L i b' makes a completely unfounded and arrogant ad hominem remark, which I justifiably take offense to, and people are negging me?! What the hell is wrong with you people?

I'm not opposed to doing another referendum actually, given a few years. Particularly once Nationalist Parties gain an absolute majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly, that would be a good time to give it another go. Since they use STV PR the number of MLAs are quite proportional to votes
 
 
We're connected and this visit by the Queen will strengthen this bond. I hope for peace and cooperation between Britain and NI. Those who oppose this are thugs who still live in the 80s
 
 
Long Live UNITED KINGDOM

Good to know that on your side of the Atlantic you have such an understanding of the people I share blood with  

The Queen is Britain's head of state, just because another country is a Republic or has history with us does not mean we 'replace' our head of state with someone else just to make them feel better. A proper peace is one in which both sides does not have to compromise it's national identity.

I'm descended from Irish immigrants so you're not the only one with blood ties to Ireland.

I just don't think sending the Queen to Ireland is going to have the expressed intended outcome. The fact that the Garda had to lock down Dublin City center and not let the Irish public within 50 feet of the Queen suggests I have a point.

That suggestion is overruled by the majority who wanted the Queen to visit. Dissident Republicans want nothing more than to keep fighting, peace means nothing to them.

I've been to Ireland enough to know that the average person no longer harbors a burning hatred towards Britain and just wants a better future.

They'll likely neg you even more for bitching about rep now...

I see you've updated your post to accommodate an actual objection. Kindly note that the Penal Laws were imposed by an independent Irish Parliament composed of, wait for it, Irish people. In Britain too, we had laws which discriminated against Roman Catholics, so it is hardly an example of oppressing the Irish. It's worth noting that some English figures in Irish politics, for example William, Earl Fitzwilliam, Lord Lieutenant in the late 18th century, opposed the Penal Laws - and was hauled over the coals by the Irish ruling classes for it.

Probably, I'm sure I'll get over it.

So there was discrimination against Catholics in England, so what? This doesn't mean Irish people were not oppressed by the British.

"The Penal Laws in Ireland (Irish: Na Péindlíthe) refers to a series of laws imposed under British rule that removed power from the native Irish Roman Catholic majority"

" English monarchs were cautious about applying the Penal Laws to Ireland because they needed the support of the Roman Catholic upper classes to put down the Gaelic Irish rebellion in the Nine Years War (1594–1603)."

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_laws 

I'm not claiming everything is black and white, it rarely is, but while Catholics were a minority in Britain, in Ireland they made up over 90% of the population; for all intents and purposes the oppression of Catholics by Anglicans amounts to the oppression of the Irish by the British.
 
 
I for one am loving this visit, it really is great to see and it's going very well. I really hope the cost recoups itself but even if it doesn't it was still well worth it. Great to see the iconic moments in Croke Park and both memorial gardens, as well as the proud moment of my university being showcased like that. Can't get enough of the Long Library! They have some energy for 85 and 90 year olds too.

So your main objection is that the Queen, being a figurehead, is symbolic of the all the bad things that have happened in the past.

My counter to that is the Queen visiting Ireland is symbolic of putting the past behind us and showing that now and in the future the two countries can have an amicable relationship.

After all, heads of state do have official state visits to other countries, so why shouldn't the Queen visit Ireland? It doesn't suggest that we're not on equal footing. I'm sure Germany's president has been on state visits to France and vice versa for example.

Fair enough. Allow me to rephrase what was not, in truth, an entirely serious statement. What I was trying to say was that I would prefer that the UK remain as GB & NI. The only change that, I believe, might benefit the UK would be the reunification of Ireland but, as I say, that's not something that I would be in favour of.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but bombs are the main issue are they not? Punch ups in bars and national rivalry are inevitable in countries with as much history between them as Britain and Ireland. This doesn't mean it can't be amicable, much like the relationship between England and France.
 
 
 
Then the majority of Irish people have short memories.

 

 
I'm not even Irish you knuckle dragging retard. And if you call murdering innocent people including woman and children as "getting one over" you're a moral vacuum.

 

The queen had nothing to do with any of it, she wasn't even born when most of it happened. Why should she get blown up?
 
 
I live in the North of Ireland and tbh by our standards it's been pretty calm. Yes, there's an extremely small minority planting devices, etc but that happens every other week where I live. The majority of Irish nationalists up here are indifferent to the visit. Personally, I think it's a good thing that she's come over and expressed her sympathies for past conflicts and the innocent people (on both sides) who got hurt because of them. However, I don't believe that it should be the monarch doing this but rather the government. When you study Ireland's history, you'll see that government policy and the willingness of politicians to sweep the Irish problem under the rug was a major cause of future conflict.

She wasn't born in 1972? when on Bloody Sunday British troops murdered innocent people? I think you'll find she was. In any case, her ancestors were responsible for the penal laws, the blocking of the emancipation act and centuries of Irish suffering.

Was she personally reponsible for bloody Sunday? The monarchy had no power by then.
So the actions of somebody's ancestors makes them equally as guilty as them? I guess we're all screwed.

She was on the throne at the time. As Britain's head of state she is a symbol for Britain and all of Britain's actions. As somebody has already said, politicians have come and gone but the Queen has remained throughout all the troubles. It's hardly surprising that many Irish people do not have a favourable opinion of the Queen.

Ask yourself this, would you want millions of pounds of your taxes being spent on putting on a lavish do and providing security for a state visit of Hitler's Grandson to Britain?
 
 
 
She was on the throne at the time. As somebody else said, politicians have come and gone but the Queen has remained throughout. It's hardly surprising that many Irish people do not have a favourable opinion of the Queen.

Quite. But how does it work in practise.

 
Descending into stereotypes now are we?  

Deary me.

 

No different from any other insult really, apart from you're fitting the stereotype. All your knowledge of Ireland and the history of the Troubles et al come from Wikipedia, you spoke as if the majority in Ireland were opposing the state visit and wished to continue the fight, which is wrong. You showed no understanding of the religous divisions between Catholics and Protestants which fuelled the fighting (why do you think that on the creation of N.Ireland Protestants went North and Catholics went South?). This coupled with the fact you've apparently never been to Ireland yourself doesn't give much weight to your arguments at all.

Maybe one day when Charles ascends the thrown you'll find out.  
 
 
A day out, innit.

Oh and w/regards to Bloody Sunday, there are members of the IRA who were there that day, but refused to answer questions as to exactly where they were or what they were doing. It would be wishful thinking I'd say to presume they weren't up to no good themselves.

It is, it says more about you than it does about me. It demonstrates your extreme ignorance as well as a distinct lack of imagination. America is a nation of 350,000,000+ people, larger than the whole of Europe and just as culturally varied. Yet you choose to generalise the whole population based on a clichéd stereotype of the deep south. Pathetic.

Firstly, allow me to correct your presumption that I've never been to Ireland. I have. I have family that live in Ireland whom I have visited several times throughout my life.

The religious divisions in Ireland are at the center of much of the conflict and I am well aware of this. The origins of these religious tensions lay, of course, in the English colonisation and displacement of the native Irish Catholic population. The subsequent penal laws, applied by the predominately British Anglicans, to oppress the Catholic majority set the tone for the following centuries of hatred and suffering.

Frankly, where I get my knowledge from is none of your concern. Nonetheless your assertion is incorrect. I quoted from Wikipedia because it's accessible and easy to reference. Regardless I have at least made some effort to use resource material to back up my points. Conversely, every contribution you've made to this thread has constituted of nothing more than unfounded subjective tripe.

She was on the throne at the time. As Britain's head of state she is a symbol for Britain and all of Britain's actions. As somebody has already said, politicians have come and gone but the Queen has remained throughout all the troubles.

Depends. Has Hitler's grandson renounced Hitler and become the president of Germany? If so, then I would have no objection to it. Not that you can remotely compare this situation to the Nazis.

I would object to millions being spent on a "lavish do" of course, but not security. It is the responsibility of the state to provide security for anyone in the country, and as the cost is so high due to Irish troublemakers, it's only right Ireland pays for it. Annoying for the vast majority of Irish who don't want to see any trouble I admit though.
 
 
 
Oh look, you just defined irony.  

 

Right, so in other words you can't think of a worthwhile retort. Stop wasting my time.

The unfortunate thing was that not a single bullet hit an IRA member; instead a lot of peaceful protestors were killed. The Saville Report did conclude that there were IRA members present but overall agreed that this provided no justification for soldiers open-firing into a crowd.

No doubt innocents got killed, I don't believe the Saville report was free from political pressures to produce a result that would help smooth things over - pushing the IRA members to answer questions wouldn't have helped relations. The IRA weren't uniformed either, so they could blend in with the innocents, I personally believe they wanted the Army to open fire so as to generate the support they got.

Although I think it's best just to let it lie now and work on the future without dragging the past with us.

It's a reference to a post of his earlier.

Yes, I agree and personally I think that the Queen's visit is helping that process along. There are some people who will never move on but right now the PR for the royal family is very good and this visit is helping to diffuse some of the bitterness in Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the Troubles only really ended in the late 90s. A lot of young people have memories of soldiers patrolling the streets and killings, etc and the memories of those who are older are much more traumatic. Therefore, it is still very much the immediate past and people need reconcilliation and closure before they can fully move on.

Godwin's law  

Hitler didn't have a grandson but if he did, and his grandson was not a Nazi, I would have no objection to him coming to the UK. I would rather he paid for his own trip but that hardly makes him deserving of death.

As for the queen she may have the power to dissolve parliament but she wouldn't have been able to have any impact on the GOVERNMENT's decision to send troops into Ireland.
She may represent Britain but she is also a human being who has not really harmed anybody personally so I don't really see why she deserves death.

We've certainly been quite friendly over the years to the current Emperor of Japan despite the Japanese behaving rather less honorably towards us than the Germans did.

No idea. But it certainly seems like she disagreed with how it happened with her actions now.

And I repeat, whichever monarch resided over this is nothing like Hitler. You can say it all you want, doesn't make it true.

You don't even know the name of the monarch you're defending?   Christ, you could have at least looked up their name to give the impression you know what you're talking about.

I'm not pretending to know what I'm talking about in that much detail. In fact, the entire thing was really irrelevant to the point I was making. You don't need to know that much about the Ireland conflict to know that it wasn't as bad as WW2...

Yes you do need to know if you're going to use it to make a statement. How much really do you know about the 'Ireland conflict'? What exactly does it consist of, in your opinion? Do you think it just erupted out of nowhere in the twentieth century and that's why you think it's somehow comparable to WWII? How is a country's centuries long struggle to regain independence in ANY way similar? Are you judging them solely from loss of life or something- as if total figures can really be calculated for Ireland. Really ignorant comment to make. Nobody is saying that it is similar to a world war, it isn't. That doesn't mean it is any way less significant, or important, or nation-defining.
 
 
 
I never really got why the Irish hate the Queen so much

 

While a small minority of people with a 'dey tuk our 6 counties!1!' mentality have been vocal in their opposition of her visit, "the Irish" in general don't hate the Queen. The most frequent criticism most normal Irish people have been making this week is about the disruption to roads and public tranport the visit has caused tbh.

Use what to make a statement? I must know the reining monarch back when this started to know that it isn't comparable to WW2? My entire point was it isn't comparable to WW2.

Though your entire rant is highly confusing. I'm accused of saying it's like WW2 then suddenly nobody is saying it (and in comparing the monarch to Hitler - yes it was a comparison).

Anyway, you yourself just said it isn't comparable to WW2 so I don't get why I'm being moaned at just because I said the same thing - as an aside to a completely different argument. And yes, it is less significant than WW2 - not to the Irish, but to the world it certainly is. Not that I ever claimed it wasn't significant, important or nation-defining anyway.
 
 
The queen did nothing to harm Ireland. The British have committed atrocities in the past however, and is the reason I refuse to wear poppies.

I will remember with pride for those who die in moral wars.

Oh cry me a river  

The poppy remembers the dead, not the wars. Whether they were fighting in the Boer War or WWII, the soldiers who died deserve to be remembered even if the war was a colossal, imperialist waste of time.

Give the popularist patriotism BS a rest will you?

During the second Boer War, the British Empire pursued the policy of rounding up and isolating the Boer civilian population into concentration camps, the earliest use of this method by modern powers - (that's right Britain, not Germany invented concentration camps). The wives and children of Boer guerrillas were sent to these camps with poor hygiene and little food; most of the children in these camps died, as did a large minority of the adults.

The people who deserve to be remembered are the innocent civilians murdered by British soldiers, not the soldiers that committed the murders. I respect the war dead of WWII because they were fighting for a noble cause. Not all war dead are deserving of the same respect.

Complete bull-****. Concentration and internment is one of the oldest military tactics in the world, modern-style camps were used long before the Boer War by powers such as the Russians, the Spanish, the Americans an no doubt others.

What you seek to do here is play on the fact that 'concentration camp' is associated with the extermination camps of the Nazis in the popular imagination. This is, of course, inaccurate.

I'm curious, what specifically is a "moral war" and by what measure does any conflict involving the Irish or English fall into that category?

So as no-matter what the combatant does to women/children or whatever, as long as he dies it's OK.

Just cause they died doesn't mean they were something to be proud of.

Your first question, I can't answer for you. Of course it's entirely subjective.

A moral conflict involving English? WWII I guess, that was Scottish, Welsh, and Irish too mind.

Well, you're the one who used the phrase, surely you must know what you were saying?

I think there's probably a case for describing British involvement in WWII as self-defence but I doubt that it would qualify as a "moral war", whatever that may be.
 
 
 
Sour grapes because the english got one over the irish years ago and now the IRA are defeated.

 

I dont know how you can say the IRA were defeated when loyalist paramilitaries have ceased as well and the removal of the British Army in Northern Ireland. No one has either won or been defeated. Incase you werent aware but we've kindve moved on from that. We have now a power-sharing executive and Assembly which is working for all sections of the community which i would say is a compromise. Im not defending what the IRA did but to say they were defeated is over the top!

Back to the subject...The Queen is invited to Ireland to help the relations between britain and Ireland which have not been the best as you already know. Many in Ireland are still sore with what happened in the past. But i think the overwhemingly majority of people have welcomed her and the visit has been significant in changing the relationship again. I neither support or have any opposition to the visit, in my opinion its just another foreign dignitary visiting Ireland. The peace process is strong and we're all moving forward and its part of the healing process of the two nations. The fact it cost €30million is quite shocking to say the least when the Irish are so badly in debted with bailouts and all sorts!
