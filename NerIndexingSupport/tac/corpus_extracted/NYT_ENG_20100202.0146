TALLAHASSEE  A Florida Senate committee unanimously approved a
bill Tuesday that would tighten the ethics requirements on the
Public Service Commission, but the measure was immediately
criticized as too soft on the companies the commission regulates.

The Communications, Energy and Public Utilities Committee passed
a measure that will force conversations into the open between
utilities and public service commissioners and their advisory
staff. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Mike Fasano, a New Port Richey
Republican.

The idea was first proposed by a 1992 grand jury but rejected by
legislators until problems resurfaced this year at the PSC. But
instead of penalizing both PSC staff members and the utility
companies who engage in illegal communication  as the grand jury
had recommended  the bill punishes only the PSC.

That provision troubles PSC Chairwoman Nancy Argenziano, a vocal
critic of her own agency, and PSC general counsel Curt Kiser.

"A penalty should go both ways," said Kiser .

Argenziano called it a "Band-Aid fix." She wants the electric,
gas, sewer and phone companies that engage in illegal communication
to be punished in addition to the PSC and wants the Legislature to
end its role in appointing commissioners.

"That language will never get you a clean PSC because you can't
get a clean PSC unless you fix the whole problem  and that includes
taking politics out of the process, including the political
influence of the Legislature," she said.
