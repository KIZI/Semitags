Michael Gill, a controversial racehorse owner accused of running
infirm horses at Penn National Race Course, has been barred from
competing at the track by the Pennsylvania Racing Commission.

The ban, which was issued Tuesday and took effect immediately,
allowed Penn National officials to scratch the four horses Gill had
entered for Wednesday night's races. The majority of the track's
jockeys had refused to ride in the four races, saying that the
presence of Gill's horses created safety risks.

The jockeys first declared their intention to boycott any races
that involved a Gill-owned horse after Gill's Laughing Moon broke
down and died in a Jan. 27 race. It was the second Gill-owned horse
to have a fatal injury at Penn National, in Grantville, Pa., over a
six-day period.

Gill led all North American thoroughbred owners in wins (370)
and in earnings ($6,670,490) in 2009.

In a letter sent to Gill, Michael Dillon, the commission's
acting executive secretary, wrote that Gill would no longer be
allowed to compete at Penn National because of an "ongoing
controversy which will jeopardize the orderly conduct of the race
meet at Penn National."

Gill's primary trainer, Anthony Adamo, was also barred from
racing at Penn National.

The ban does not prohibit Gill from running at Pennsylvania's
other two thoroughbred tracks, Philadelphia Park and Presque Isle.

It is unusual for a commission to bar an owner from one track
within a state but not others.

"The bottom line here, if they had a reason for this, don't you
think they'd tell you what it is?" Gill said Tuesdayby phone.
"They have no reason."

Gill, who has said that he is so disillusioned over his problems
at Penn National that he is leaving the sport, also said that he
would file lawsuits against Penn National and the Pennsylvania
Racing Commission. He continued to insist that the problem was not
with his horses but with the condition of the racing surface at
Penn National.

"When people start writing about breakdowns, they put Penn
National front and center," Gill said. "Penn National has a
three-year history of horses breaking down."

Gill maintains that he had five horses suffer fatal injuries at
Penn National in 2009, a number track officials said they could not
verify. He made 990 starts at Penn National, which translates to a
rate of 5.05 fatalities per 1,000 starters. According to Eric
Schippers, Penn National's vice president for public affairs, there
were 2.69 deaths per 1,000 starters over all at the track.

Gill said he had only one other horse be fatally injured at a
track other than Penn National in 2009.

Dillon's letter to Gill claimed that the commission had also
been informed by a group representing Penn National-based horsemen
that several trainers were also unwilling to participate in races
involving Gill's horses. The commission concluded the planned
boycotts by jockeys and trainers would have a negative effect on
the amount of money wagered on Penn National races.
