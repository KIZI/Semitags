Welcome to Occupy Phoenix, the latest violent embarrassment to American society. This group of occupiers is asking, "When should you shoot a cop?" Pamphlets asking this question and laying out justifications for doing so were left at the Occupy Wall Street location in Phoenix, Arizona and found by a Maricopa County Sheriff Deputy.

When Should You Shoot A Cop?

That question, even without an answer, makes most law-abiding taxpayers go into knee-jerk conniptions. The indoctrinated masses all race to see who can be first, and loudest to proclaim that it is NEVER okay to forcibly resist law enforcement. In doing so, they also inadvertently demonstrate why so much of human history has been plagued by tyranny and oppression.
In an ideal world, cops would do nothing except protect people from thieves and attackers, in which case shooting a cop would never be justified. In the real world, however, far more injustice, violence, torture, theft, and outright murder has been committed IN THE NAME of law enforcement, than has been committed in spite of it. To get a little perspective, try watching a documentary or two about some of the atrocities committed by the regimes of Stalin, or Lenin, or Chaiman Mao, or Hitler, or Pol Pot, or any number of other tyrants in history. Pause the film when the jackboots are about to herd innocent people into cattle cars, or gun them down as they stand on the edge of a ditch, and THEN ask yourself the question, When should you shoot a cop?

Department of Public Safety officials confirm to New Times that a stack of fliers was found at the "Occupy Phoenix" demonstration at Cesar Chavez Plaza in Phoenix yesterday. The fliers basically explain when it's OK to shoot a cop, hence the title of the document: "When Should You Shoot a Cop."

Don't go blaming the anti-establishment "occupiers" just yet, though -- DPS spokesman Bart Graves says it's currently unclear who's responsible for the fliers.

"At ths point we don't see any connection between the fliers and Occupy Phoenix," Graves tells New Times.

Here's the thing Ravi, my daughter goes down there from time to time, and protests with those kids. She is a wonderful student, and a good kid and so are most of the kids who she associates with. I only have that to go on, and can tell you based on that, I would hesitate to condemn a whole group of young people who have nothing but the best of intentions, even though I may not agree with everything they stand for, based on the actions of perhaps one person with an agenda.

Yep. That's what these kids have on their side. Most of the are good kids and have parents that love them.

Calling them shitters and COWS makes people that do the name calling look ridiculous and petty.

But hey, that's our Willow.
 
 
Here's the thing Navy - It's not ONE person with an agenda. It's not ONE incident in one city. The "movement" has been hijacked by extremists and your daughter and her friends could be putting themselves in danger.
 
 
Nazi's ? Whenever they still have a heartbeat.
 
 
 
Has Napolitano added OWS to her 'terrorist' list, yet?

 

Not yet...  
 
 
 
That's right folks, according to the OWS crowd, changing society "almost always requires" killing law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers in the Grand Canyon state have been placed on high alert and the  Arizona Counter-Terrorism Information Center  has published a safety memo in response to the threats of unapologetic cop killing.

 

 

Could this be what Obama is backing? Counting upon to suspend everything? Take over reigns of power? Could it spread?

Well, we have plenty of examples of anti-semitism and racism in OWS. A hell of a lot more than there ever was for the TP.

Hell of a lot more.

And, we have a hell of a lot more examples of rhetoric calling for violence. In fact, we have tons of violence from them already.

Now, calls to attack cops?

They are a hateful, anti-semitic, racist, violent group.

And, we can surely expect to see a memo from Napolitano calling them radicals and put them on the domestic terrorist watch.

THAT would be rational, based on their stated rational for what the TP is and what vets are.

Willow, while these kinds of things are not to be condoned, perhaps its best in this case to see whats going on here.

 

Navy,

Unless these pamphlets specifically encourage the assassination of police and provide specific advice on how to go about it, they are perfectly legitimate informational brochures and as such are protected by Amendment One.

Cops are not sacred cows. Cops have been known to commit every type of criminal offense from larceny and extortion to forcible rape, child molestation, murder and (frequent examples of) aggravated assault. Therefore there clearly are circumstances under which it would be perfectly justifiable to use lethal force against a cop whose behavior manifests an unlawfully lethal threat.

Tea Party, obeys the law, follows the rules and use the political process to make change. You support criminals anarchists and low lifes.

 Occupy Phoenix Asks: When Should You Shoot a Cop? - Katie Pavlich 

 

Oh my God. Shooting a cop, in the US; That's a good way to make certain that you don't see the sun for many years. I see what you're asking, though. Hindsight's 20/20. I'm sure that those murdered under Ho Chi Minh, Pol Pot, Hitler, Stalin, or the Hutus during the Rwandan Genocide probably thought they were just following some kind of law as they walked into the slaughter. Well....maybe not in Rwanda, where they just kind of showed up at Tutsi residences and blew them away.

Are you asking at what point we see law enforcement as legmen for a police state.....or just discussing the ridiculous propoganda passed out at OWS?
 
 
 
So wait? When the left was vilifying Tea Party rallies because some members showed up with weapons ( LEGALLY) what was your position then?

 

Although I do lean toward the political left I happen to be an Amendment Two advocate. My position on those who showed up armed was they have a right to do that -- although some of them looked like damn fools with their exaggerated holster rigs. I believe open carry is disadvantageous because it leaves one vulnerable. Concealed carry is the way to go. But if one doesn't mind looking foolish they have a right to do that.

 
When the left claimed that simply using a target circle on a candidate was a call for violence when Giffords got shot, what was your position then?

 

I don't subscribe to that extreme notion. I believe it takes more than a superimposed target circle on a printed ad to provoke an assassination. The guy who did that is a psycho and what he did was an incident poised to happen. If the target circle didn't push him over the edge something else would have.

Getting back to the issue at hand; are you willing to say there are no circumstances under which you would consider using lethal force against a cop?

Back to the issue? The pamphlets did not provide context and implied that street protestors were wrong for not targeting cops. I would shot a cop if he was in violation of the law and a direct threat to my life or my families life. However if I CHOSE to riot those conditions would NOT apply.
 
 
 
 
So wait? When the left was vilifying Tea Party rallies because some members showed up with weapons ( LEGALLY) what was your position then?

 

Although I do lean toward the political left I happen to be an Amendment Two advocate. My position on those who showed up armed was they have a right to do that -- although some of them looked like damn fools with their exaggerated holster rigs. I believe open carry is disadvantageous because it leaves one vulnerable. Concealed carry is the way to go. But if one doesn't mind looking foolish they have a right to do that.

 
When the left claimed that simply using a target circle on a candidate was a call for violence when Giffords got shot, what was your position then?

 

I don't subscribe to that extreme notion. I believe it takes more than a superimposed target circle on a printed ad to provoke an assassination. The guy who did that is a psycho and what he did was an incident poised to happen. If the target circle didn't push him over the edge something else would have.

Getting back to the issue at hand; are you willing to say there are no circumstances under which you would consider using lethal force against a cop?

 

I am willing. I cannot think of a single time when it would be wise or legal to use lethal force against a police officer.. None.
 
 
Why are they occupying Phoenix? And obviously there's never a good time to shoot a cop. I just don't get these people. Occupying cities like Oakland,Nashville,and Phoenix makes no sense. What are they demanding from those cities? What do they want? I mean i can understand protesting Wall Street and the White House but the rest of this stuff is becoming pretty lame. What do they think they're gonna get from cities like Oakland,Nashville,and Phoenix? Now they're just starting to look like ignorant nutters. Time to wrap this whole "Occupation" thing up. They look dumber & dumber by the day.

Paul, it's the same reason that there were Tea Party rallies all over the US, instead of JUST the Boston Harbor.

Not all rallies were just in Washington D.C. I seem to recall one in Nashville. And there was one in Bowling Green, KY, where I was living at the time.

Same thing, just different ideas.
 
 
The "Occupiers" should just quit while they're still slightly ahead. They really do look more & more like ignorant nutters by the day. It seems only the hardcore Wingnuts are still out there "Occupying." Time to call it quits. They have nothing left to gain.
 
 
 
 
Willow is latched onto #OWS like a broker onto a derivative or pension fund LOLOL

 

 

cows....who shit on everything.

 

What is your problem w/ the disintegrating, middle-class willow?  
 
 
 
 
 
Department of Public Safety officials confirm to New Times that a stack of fliers was found at the "Occupy Phoenix" demonstration at Cesar Chavez Plaza in Phoenix yesterday. The fliers basically explain when it's OK to shoot a cop, hence the title of the document: "When Should You Shoot a Cop."

Don't go blaming the anti-establishment "occupiers" just yet, though -- DPS spokesman Bart Graves says it's currently unclear who's responsible for the fliers.

"At ths point we don't see any connection between the fliers and Occupy Phoenix," Graves tells New Times.

Willow, while these kinds of things are not to be condoned, perhaps its best in this case to see whats going on here.

 

Why be sensible?

 

Here's the thing Ravi, my daughter goes down there from time to time, and protests with those kids. She is a wonderful student, and a good kid and so are most of the kids who she associates with. I only have that to go on, and can tell you based on that, I would hesitate to condemn a whole group of young people who have nothing but the best of intentions, even though I may not agree with everything they stand for, based on the actions of perhaps one person with an agenda.

 

Serious question. What is your daughter protesting? And the other kids what are they protesting out of Phoenix?

I watched an in depth program on a very very left wing news station (CBC) who were desperate to make heads or tails of what the protestors in Washington wanted and even they couldn't pull out a coherent message.

So what's up in Phoenix? Does Occupy Phoenix have a message that makes sense?

They LOST the argument.

No. It may have early on but now no one knows what they're doing. What do they want from Phoenix? They should just list their demands clearly and concisely so people can understand what they want. I'm sure cities like Phoenix and Oakland have no idea what these people want from them. I can understand hating on Wall Street and the White House,but these "Occupations" in these cities makes no sense to anyone. Their time is up. Now it's just boring over-kill. They've worn out their welcome. It's over.

ALL the 'Occupations' are intended to be intimidations...Funny? The people of this Republic are more pissed off about the idiocy than they are supportive.
 
 
 
Welcome to Occupy Phoenix, the latest violent embarrassment to American society. This group of occupiers is asking, "When should you shoot a cop?" Pamphlets asking this question and laying out justifications for doing so were left at the Occupy Wall Street location in Phoenix, Arizona and found by a Maricopa County Sheriff Deputy.

When Should You Shoot A Cop?

That question, even without an answer, makes most law-abiding taxpayers go into knee-jerk conniptions. The indoctrinated masses all race to see who can be first, and loudest to proclaim that it is NEVER okay to forcibly resist law enforcement. In doing so, they also inadvertently demonstrate why so much of human history has been plagued by tyranny and oppression.
In an ideal world, cops would do nothing except protect people from thieves and attackers, in which case shooting a cop would never be justified. In the real world, however, far more injustice, violence, torture, theft, and outright murder has been committed IN THE NAME of law enforcement, than has been committed in spite of it. To get a little perspective, try watching a documentary or two about some of the atrocities committed by the regimes of Stalin, or Lenin, or Chaiman Mao, or Hitler, or Pol Pot, or any number of other tyrants in history. Pause the film when the jackboots are about to herd innocent people into cattle cars, or gun them down as they stand on the edge of a ditch, and THEN ask yourself the question, When should you shoot a cop?

Agreed. Up here we had Occupy Toronto and the protestors were there protesting of course the ever elusive corporate greed, but also not enough bike paths in Canada, shutting down our oil industry immediately, demolishing all zoos and freeing all the animals and stopping hockey violence.

 

ETA: When I heard the demand to stop all hockey violence I knew these people were freaking lunatics.!

Same thing, just different ideas.

 

Lets see, Tea party, a movement to LEGALLY change the direction of the Government through the election of Members of Congress from around the Country. A movement that had no riots, no occupations, that registered every protest, got the required permits for all protests and gathers. That articulated their goal and managed to elect some 60 people to Congress LEGALLY.

OWS, a bunch of spoiled brats that want the government to pay their legal debts, pay them to do nothing, redistribute illegally other peoples money. A movement that violates the law, illegally camps on public property, riots and advocates violence. A movement that can not actually articulate a single legal or Constitutional thought, that makes no effort to campaign for Congress.

Ya good comparison there.

Sheesh. Talk about wanting the moon. Kids these days!

Yea i'll start shooting grenades and tear gas at em too if they take fighting out of Hockey. That's part of what makes Hockey great. It aint no sissy sport. So they better not mess with my Hockey. I don't want to have to get pissed. They wouldn't like me when i get pissed. I'll check em hard and then land several upper-cuts for the K.O.  
 
 
Yeah I remember all those gun totting wingnuts showing off their guns. No wait, sorry that was the tea baggerz

Oh, so partisan. The proverbial record skips again. Please, spare me the Tea Party reeducation; you all sound like I ROBOT: "Identify it! 'ONE OF US!' Which one? 'ONE OF US!'"

I've seen videos of 60-70 year old men involved with OWS. I doubt that mommy and daddy are still around to pamper them. They don't all support Obama. They aren't all unemployed.

Have you actually taken the time to research what they are doing? I'm not involved with OWS or the Tea Party. But it sure is fun to watch the extremes of both wings go at it.   It's great entertainment, and the news (entertainment channels) has enjoyed showing the fringes of both movements...both of which are loons (fringes of the movements). OWS loons-speak of "income inequality", and Tea Party loons-walk around with their Barney Fife revolvers and holsters, strapped to their sweatpants. Classy individuals, all of them.

Have you stopped to think that maybe the REASONABLE members (the ones who go home at night, and don't try to get arrested) see something that you don't? MSNBC did their level best to show the Tea Party toting the posters of Obama as a tribesman with a bone through his nose. And Fox has done a great job of identifying every unemployed stoner involved with OWS, and has called them to the cameras for interviews.

Have you been to the OWS and READ what their grievances are? I know what both the Tea Party's and OWS's grievances are. It's pretty simple to understand. What are you confused about?
 
 
All those evil nations or regimes they listed (Pol Pot, Stalin, etc).............do the OWS people not realize that those nations followed THE SAME ideology that 95% of OWS folks are cheering for to come here? Big gov't control, resource redistribution, etc, etc?????

Dumbasses never fail to remind me how dumb they are.

A small piece of input as a former cop: I'd say 90% of cops are fairly disgruntled with the city/county government they work for, as most folks are about their own jobs. Most cops think a lot of laws are simpy stupid and dont enforce them.

So if anyone is worried that a "Police State" will evolve where local cops are beating down your door to take your guns or money or gold.......or whatever "police state" ideals one has, I think there is 0% chance of that. Cops have DESCRETION. They MUST disobey an order if it is unlawful. Further, they can simply CHOOSE not to enforce a law they feel is petty or improper for the situation. This ability to make the individual choice is the biggest difference between domestic cops and our military, or to a foreign "police" which is basically that nation's military. Cops dont go to jail for disobeying orders. They probably wont even get fired. They can quit any day they want with no consequence other than not getting paid anymore.

So.....it's fair to say, with our law enforcement arrangement, the only laws that will be truly enforced are ones that 95% of cops agree are good. And try getting 95% of cops to agree on anything.....good luck! The ONLY way a true police state would happen here is if martial law were declared, and it was the military as they have the option of jailing their people who don't obey orders. And even then.....I believe the majority of the military would disobey a tyrannical order on their own people.

WHich is why some radical lefties want a UN force of foreign troops to be the globes only ruling force.

But a Stalin-like police state being implemented with our current local cops? No chance. They'd never do it. They already CHOOSE not to enforce dumbass petty laws that mayors and governors pass on a daily basis. A law is nothing but ink on paper without people to enforce it.

Link to what? That Stalin was a communist? The left wingers want the same ideals that Pol Pot, Stalin, Lenin, etc, all advocated to become reality here? Redistribution of resources? That can ONLY be done by force. As Stalin and Lenin showed us.

As a matter of course they wouldn't enforce it as THEY are citizens as the Posse Commtatus ACT has prohibited Military from turning on citizens...by force.

Yep. That's what these kids have on their side. Most of the are good kids and have parents that love them.

Calling them shitters and COWS makes people that do the name calling look ridiculous and petty.

But hey, that's our Willow.

 

cry me a fucking river. The Tea Party endured the insults.. now it's your damn turn. lard ass.

 

And the Tea Party is nothing like some in the ows.

100% right. I know for fact most cops think their host government (being just the politicians of that city or county) is mostly out of touch morons. They do the job anyway, and try to ignore the political BS day to day.

But in the end, if City Hall or the State gov'ts issued a tyrannical law or order, the cops would say "Screw that" and either quit or just refuse to do it. I mean what would the mayors do, "Call the cops" on the cops?

The United States is BLESSED beyond belief with two things: A police force, and a military.....whose morals are such that neither could fathom turning on it's own people. Thats what seperates us from the rest of the world.

Cops have DESCRETION. They MUST disobey an order if it is unlawful. Further, they can simply CHOOSE not to enforce a law they feel is petty or improper for the situation. This ability to make the individual choice is the biggest difference between domestic cops and our military, or to a foreign "police" which is basically that nation's military. Cops dont go to jail for disobeying orders. They probably wont even get fired. They can quit any day they want with no consequence other than not getting paid anymore.

So.....it's fair to say, with our law enforcement arrangement, the only laws that will be truly enforced are ones that 95% of cops agree are good. And try getting 95% of cops to agree on anything.....good luck! The ONLY way a true police state would happen here is if martial law were declared, and it was the military as they have the option of jailing their people who don't obey orders. And even then.....I believe the majority of the military would disobey a tyrannical order on their own people.

WHich is why some radical lefties want a UN force of foreign troops to be the globes only ruling force.

But a Stalin-like police state being implemented with our current local cops? No chance. They'd never do it. They already CHOOSE not to enforce dumbass petty laws that mayors and governors pass on a daily basis. A law is nothing but ink on paper without people to enforce it.

 

I would only act violently against another in Self Defense, or the defense of another Life, I would do what I needed to do to Neutralize, if I was forced to Kill, I probably would, only if there was no other option. Being in such a situation, the Perpetrator, would be the one outside of the Law, Badge or no Badge. Involved in a Demonstration, I would surrender that Right, for the sake of the Others Present, unless it was a lone Psycho Mass Murdering.
 
 
Unfortunately, the media and Hollywood have painted a picture of cops that is less than flattering. And most people are morons enough to believe it's reality.

As a matter of course they wouldn't enforce it as THEY are citizens as the Posse Commtatus ACT has prohibited Military from turning on citizens...by force.

I Think if it came to it? They'd turn on Governmnemnt itself.

 

100% right. I know for fact most cops think their host government (being just the politicians of that city or county) is mostly out of touch morons. They do the job anyway, and try to ignore the political BS day to day.

But in the end, if City Hall or the State gov'ts issued a tyrannical law or order, the cops would say "Screw that" and either quit or just refuse to do it. I mean what would the mayors do, "Call the cops" on the cops?

The United States is BLESSED beyond belief with two things: A police force, and a military.....whose morals are such that neither could fathom turning on it's own people. Thats what seperates us from the rest of the world.

 

Entirely true. Most cops *I* know and work with would turn in thier badges if given an unlawful order.

THEY are Citizens as well.
 
 
 
 
Willow, while these kinds of things are not to be condoned, perhaps its best in this case to see whats going on here.

 

Navy,

Unless these pamphlets specifically encourage the assassination of police and provide specific advice on how to go about it, they are perfectly legitimate informational brochures and as such are protected by Amendment One.

Cops are not sacred cows. Cops have been known to commit every type of criminal offense from larceny and extortion to forcible rape, child molestation, murder and (frequent examples of) aggravated assault. Therefore there clearly are circumstances under which it would be perfectly justifiable to use lethal force against a cop whose behavior manifests an unlawfully lethal threat.

 

Straight out of the anarchists hand book. Blame the cops just because radicals do not like authority. BOO HOO! Arrest them all.

There's all kinds of People, and good and bad in every group. I've seen both the best and the worst. The Worst eventually get dealt with. The trick is in accomplishing that before serious damage is done. That's not always the easy thing to do. When I see a Badge, I respect it and who's behind it. It is only reasonable.

Its so comical it's sad.

They hate cops, but then, demand "laws against X, and a law against Y, and a law stating X must be done".

They do know all their "demands" for laws can only be enforced....by men with guns?
 
 
 
Back to the issue? The pamphlets did not provide context and implied that street protestors were wrong for not targeting cops. I would shot a cop if he was in violation of the law and a direct threat to my life or my families life. However if I CHOSE to riot those conditions would NOT apply.

 

What do you mean by "riot?" What specific behaviors would you be manifesting if you were participating in a riot?

Do you believe the protesters we saw being constrained by the use of tear gas, flash bang grenades and, in at least one example, potentially lethal force were in fact rioting?

I consider the actions that occurred in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvestant section in the 1960s, the actions that took place in Watts, and in L.A. subsequent to the Rodney King police acquittal, and the actions in Seattle during the WTO meeting as riots. I haven't seen any riots in any of the OWS protests. Just demonstrations.

I don't hate cops. Nor do I love cops -- or worship authority, which happens to be an increasing problem in the U.S.

I regard cops as a necessary evil. Like trained attack dogs our police should treated with appropriate respect and they must be well cared for. But they must be very well trained and their behavior should be carefully constrained.
 
 
 
 
 
All those evil nations or regimes they listed (Pol Pot, Stalin, etc).............do the OWS people not realize that those nations followed THE SAME ideology that 95% of OWS folks are cheering for to come here? Big gov't control, resource redistribution, etc, etc?????

Dumbasses never fail to remind me how dumb they are.

 

Link?

 

Link to what? That Stalin was a communist? The left wingers want the same ideals that Pol Pot, Stalin, Lenin, etc, all advocated to become reality here? Redistribution of resources? That can ONLY be done by force. As Stalin and Lenin showed us.

Welcome to Occupy Phoenix, the latest violent embarrassment to American society. This group of occupiers is asking, "When should you shoot a cop?" Pamphlets asking this question and laying out justifications for doing so were left at the Occupy Wall Street location in Phoenix, Arizona and found by a Maricopa County Sheriff Deputy.

When Should You Shoot A Cop?

That question, even without an answer, makes most law-abiding taxpayers go into knee-jerk conniptions. The indoctrinated masses all race to see who can be first, and loudest to proclaim that it is NEVER okay to forcibly resist law enforcement. In doing so, they also inadvertently demonstrate why so much of human history has been plagued by tyranny and oppression.
In an ideal world, cops would do nothing except protect people from thieves and attackers, in which case shooting a cop would never be justified. In the real world, however, far more injustice, violence, torture, theft, and outright murder has been committed IN THE NAME of law enforcement, than has been committed in spite of it. To get a little perspective, try watching a documentary or two about some of the atrocities committed by the regimes of Stalin, or Lenin, or Chaiman Mao, or Hitler, or Pol Pot, or any number of other tyrants in history. Pause the film when the jackboots are about to herd innocent people into cattle cars, or gun them down as they stand on the edge of a ditch, and THEN ask yourself the question, When should you shoot a cop?

 Occupy Phoenix Asks: When Should You Shoot a Cop? - Katie Pavlich 

 

The movement has certainly taken on a violent tinge. The fact that these fliers were on a table full of handouts and it took a cop, to take action- speaks volumes to the idea that killing a cop was acceptable information to pass around.

The blatant hypocrisy, of how the media has covered these demonstrations and TEA Party rallies, is telling of just how corrupted the media has become... it is now way beyond just mere bias.

The Only Question here is how long is it going to Take America to wake up to what is really going on in OWS.

Yes I know a lot of them are just kids, Students with Understandable Beefs, not really radicals. But the Movement is being driven, Orchestrated, and coordinated by the Radical Left. Soro's and the Bunch. The Core of the Movement is Socialist, Anarchists, and Nazis. The Goal of the people behind this was never to Create a Tea Party of the left. It is to recreate the Unrest we have been seeing Both In Europe and across the Arab world here in America. It's a signal of the Extreme Far lefts Desperation. They can read the Tea Leaves, and know they are sure to lose power again in 2012, Even if Obama wins the WH. This is Plan B for when the Ballot Box Fails them again. Mob Intimidation, and Coercion through Strikes, Boycotts, Riots and General Unrest. In the End this is always the Way with Big Government Socialism/Communism, Because they have a real Problem with Democracy. They can never seem to get enough people to agree to their Ideas, so in the end they will always need ways around the Democratic Process to Implement their Agenda.

If you don't think the U.S. is incrementally becoming a police state there is much you need to learn about contemporary reality. The following is excerpted from a Cato Institute article. I urge you to read the full article because I think you'll find it enlightening.

(Excerpt)

Americans have long maintained that a mans home is his castle and that he has the right to defend it from unlawful intruders. Unfortunately, that right may be disappearing. Over the last 25 years, America has seen a disturbing militarization of its civilian law enforcement, along with a dramatic and unsettling rise in the use of paramilitary police units (most commonly called Special Weapons and Tactics, or SWAT) for routine police work. The most common use of SWAT teams today is to serve narcotics warrants, usually with forced, unannounced entry into the home.

These increasingly frequent raids, 40,000 per year by one estimate, are needlessly subjecting nonviolent drug offenders, bystanders, and wrongly targeted civilians to the terror of having their homes invaded while theyre sleeping, usually by teams of heavily armed paramilitary units dressed not as police officers but as soldiers. These raids bring unnecessary violence and provocation to nonviolent drug offenders, many of whom were guilty of only misdemeanors. The raids terrorize innocents when police mistakenly target the wrong residence. And they have resulted in dozens of needless deaths and injuries, not only of drug offenders, but also of police officers, children, bystanders, and innocent suspects. This paper presents a history and overview of the issue of paramilitary drug raids, provides an extensive catalogue of abuses and mistaken raids, and offers recommendations for reform.

Nope. Most people who finished 8th grade in the US know who Stalin, Pol Pot, and Lenin were.

I'm looking for the 95% claim. It would be no more fair, if someone were to say: "Oh the Tea Partiers were 80% racist, 40% fundamentalist Christian, 50% anti semitic, etc..."

Nope, they said the tea parties were 100% racists, mostly fundamentalists, though I never heard anti-semitism thrown about.
 
 
 
 
That's right folks, according to the OWS crowd, changing society "almost always requires" killing law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers in the Grand Canyon state have been placed on high alert and the  Arizona Counter-Terrorism Information Center  has published a safety memo in response to the threats of unapologetic cop killing.

 

 

Could this be what Obama is backing? Counting upon to suspend everything? Take over reigns of power? Could it spread?

 

It wouldn't take much with any president tie down several major cities and any president would suspend rule of law, what I am I saying only a communist thug would do that.
 
 
 
Unfortunately, the media and Hollywood have painted a picture of cops that is less than flattering. And most people are morons enough to believe it's reality.

 

I will agree with you on that. Most cops are decent people who are just trying to earn a living and go home to their families. It's too easy to call people who believe what they watch in a fictional movie, morons. I would say that they are guilty of overthinking things instead. Bad apple cops are few and far between. Most of the time, they are weeded out before they cause any destruction. Cops are usually VERY good at reading people because they're used to people trying to bullshit them, and they will identify the weirdo before he/she straps on a gun. It happens all the time.

Sometimes the bad ones slip through the cracks. There are few things more dangerous than a psychopathic cop.

I understand their grievances, but yes...I get what you're saying. An attorney or judge could say for certain, but I would interpret that as assault.

There's a difference between a peaceful protest and threatening someone.
 
 
...trounced. With president Obama & family probably already packing for their move out of the White House, the OWS has no one to blame but themselves. If the OWS movement had protested in class instead of a vagrant mass it would have lent credence to their objective. I must say that the anti semetic remarks coupled with the violent 'shoot the cops'(where the hell did this come from???) pamphlets will lead to the biggest single defeat of the DNC in U.S. history. To add insult to injury the so called cops are UNION MEMBERS ALSO!!!!!! The OWS is turning on their own prized union members!
As a Libertarian I see the group identity battle between the demmies & repubies from an unbiased perspective, like I'm socially liberal & financially conservative. I have close friends from both political ideologies so understand both ideologies. BUT, these latest hate for the sake of hate moves by the OWS are nothing more than political suicide. There remains not one advantage to the OWS anti semetic remarks let alone the shoot the cops pamphlets that I can ascertain.
Am I missing something that you know??? Or, are these people just this stupid??? It's like saying... "I'll teach you for punching me in the mouth, I'm gonna burn down my house!" I'm telling ya there's a phuking dummy born every minute!!!

They diid and still do call them baggers

 

Tsk, tsk Willow...

The Tea Party started it by calling themselves Tea "Baggers"...
The first big day for this movement was Tax Day, April 15. And organizers had a gimmick. They asked people to send a tea bag to the Oval Office. One of the exhortations was Tea Bag the Fools in D.C. A protester was spotted with a sign saying, Tea Bag the Liberal Dems Before They Tea Bag You. So, conservatives started it: started with this terminology. But others ran with it and ran with it. (Duh...left the door WIDE open (pun intended))  Rise of an Epithet 
 
 
The Occupy Wall Street movement has, from the beginning, stressed non violence. The  blog  post that got the "ball rolling":
On the 17th of September, we want to see 20,000 people to flood into lower Manhattan, set up beds, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months, one statement says. Like our brothers and sisters in Egypt, Greece, Spain, and Iceland, we plan to use the revolutionary Arab Spring tactic of mass occupation to restore democracy in America. We also encourage the use of nonviolence to achieve our ends and maximize the safety of all participants.  Notice where non violence is stressed by the people that started this movement?

These pamphlets were left at an Occupy protest. There is no source for these pamphlets and could very well have come from the likes of a Breitbart or O'Keefe...who have proven time and again that they will go to ANY lengths to create a story.

Have any prominent supporters of the OWS movement made incendiary statements? Have radio talk show hosts like  Joyce Kaufman  made on air comments like If ballots dont work, bullets will.

Have candidates running for public office who happen to support the OWS movement made comments about "  2nd Amendment Remedies  " and "taking out" a US Senator?

Surely you've all heard of Agent Provocateurs haven't you?

When there is any evidence that the pamphlets were distributed by someone other than OWS, I'll agree they were not part of OWS. There is none.

They were distributed at OWS and at two separate OWS locations that we know of.

"Where is the violence?"

Watch the news. Read the reports.

 

 

Whenever there is a protest gathering of substantial size, regardless of how conscientiously determined to remain peaceful the majority of protesters are there almost always are a few individuals who have their own ideas. If one or two individuals decide to toss things at the police or destroy property their actions serve as justifiable provocation for police to move aggressively against the entire gathering, as we have recently seen.

One notable exception to the typical scenario was seen in the first Occupy demonstration at Wall Street when violent actions were perpetrated by police supervisors against peaceful protesters with absolutely no justifying provocation at all. And it is typical when police are seen engaging demonstrators that the public automatically assumes their actions are justifiable regardless of how aggressive or, in some cases, excessively brutal they may be.
 
 
A badge does not give someone the authority to brake the law, a badge does not raise someone above the law so they can hurt of kill a person. A person who carriers a badge is dully sworn, but when he kills someone beyond his authority he becomes a criminal and law breaker, do people stand around and watch people kill other people?
 
 
 
They are being distributed at OWS. I have no evidence that they are not anyone other than OWS.

When there is any evidence that the pamphlets were distributed by someone other than OWS, I'll agree they were not part of OWS. There is none.

They were distributed at OWS and at two separate OWS locations that we know of.

According to attorney Brian Glick in his book War at Home, the FBI used four main methods during COINTELPRO:

1.Infiltration: Agents and informers did not merely spy on political activists. Their main purpose was to discredit and disrupt. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.

2.Psychological Warfare From the Outside: The FBI and police used a myriad of other "dirty tricks" to undermine progressive movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials and others to cause trouble for activists.

As per the above; I'm old enough to remember an individual named Daniel Segretti who was Richard Nixon's "dirty tricks" specialist. One of the things he did was to write and print up pamphlets with content that was misleading and damaging to Nixon's political opponents and surreptitiously distribute them at opponents' rallies.

So you should know that until there is some evidence that OWS is the source of the pamphlets at issue their discovery should be viewed with suspicion. Keep in mind that the size and persistance of the OWS movement is such that it's gotten the attention of those who are sufficiently concerned as to resort to such "dirty tricks."

You have no evidence that the pamphlets handed out at the OWS were put there by someone other than the OWS.

Neo-Nazis bring guns to the rally. Where is the media?

 
Armed citizen militia group US Border Guard is making its presence felt at the Occupy Phoenix demonstration to protect free speech rights, arguing that the second amendment prevents the state from abusing the first amendment.

The group has been labeled neo-nazis by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is usually a demonization tactic, but the individual shown in the clip,  JT Ready has attended neo-nazi rallies and is closely affiliated with the fringe National Socialist Party.

DIRTY tricks designed to besmirch the character of populist movements are as American as APPLE PIE and SATURATION BOMBING.

If you ever find yourself in a room of activists?

The person who most supports idea of violence and doing crime is PROBABLY working for some police organization.

But those people will NOT be the only types infiltrating the organization.

There will ALSO be one guy who makes it his mission to appear to be a very reasonable guy and one who is not violent.

In all likihood that guy will appear to be in diametirc opposition to the guy calling for violence and crime. They may even appear to hate one another.

That reasonable guy will be the agent sent to achieve a leadership position in the organization.

It will be his job to pass on information about the organization and if he can achieve it, to subtlely see to it that the organziation becomes a tool of the forces inflitrating it.

He'll probably not be there alone, but will have followers who will support him in order to see to it that he or she achieves a leading role in the organization.

Now the OWS movement is basically leaderless, far as I can tell.No body, far as I can tell, is the offical spokeman for this movement

But I would be very surprised if there wasn't agent provocateurs found in every site where the OWS movement is camped.

Never every EVER get involved in any politically motivated criminal conspiracy, folks.

Right or left wing, violent or non violent, it doesn't matter... just don't do it.

We live in a secret police state, folks. These people are masters of manipulation

For the average non involved citizen that doesn't much matter, but for activists of any kind, that is something you ought to never forget.
 
 
Perhaps you are right editec but the OWS prides itself on its "all inclusive" policy. The anarchists, the communists, the Neo-Nazis, the nutjobs, etc. are all welcome. Hence - they OWN it.

Yes, that is true.

OWS has the same problem that the Tea Party movement had in that respect. The range of poltical beliefs in both popilist movements includes the most radical elements of their respective political spectrums.

Basically, the OWS movement is the political soup that has not yet eaten itself.

  Occupy Phoenix Veteran Protesters with AR-15's protecting the other protesters - YouTube 

Just as food for thought here, one must understand the nature of protests here in Phoenix, they tend to draw all kinds of people. While watching the news of the protesters in New York for example and trying to apply that same dynamic here, you would be making a big mistake. Arizona tends to draw people from both sides of every single issue. Perhaps, that might be a good reason why the Arizona DPS is not prointing the finger of blame at OWS on this issue just yet. I tend to believe and still do that vast majority of those young people there, with a few exceptions, have nothing but the best intentions and wish only for a better nation and for the most part feel the nation is heading in a direction that ignores its own people at the expense of others. The founders of our nations in my humble realized that people might feel this way from time to time and in their wisdom gave us the ability to voice that opinion amongst others. So for those young people as well as others there who have nothing but the best interntions, again even though I may not agree with all they stand for, they are just as American as I am, and just as passionate about the nation in which we live.

One thing to consider here, for the last decade our nation has spent in blood and money rebuilding other nations and often time at the expense of its very own citizens. Perhaps its time we focus that nation building effort on this nation where it belongs in the first place. So if they accomplish only to start a long needed conversation on that, then maybe just maybe these young people have done us all a good deed.

If you want folks to be rational, then don't sell out rationality for partisanship.
