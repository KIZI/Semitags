Sooo...

Sea at Atl
KC at NYJ
Stl at Ari

Both the Jets and Atl are at home, with KC packing the season in 6 weeks
ago, and Sea possibly resting starters.

KC is a few pct points below us in suckatude and will draft in front of us
unless the NYJ and Cinci win this weekend... esp if Clev beats SF at home.

I think we are slightly above Balt, and for sure Atl (if Atl wins.)

So to recap... we need to REALLY root for the NYJ's for two reasons (helps
us draft above the Jets for sure, and possibly above KC) and also root for
Atl (not likely, but shit like this happened last year). Â I don't think
Stl could beat Ariz away no matter what, and would prolly pick ahead of us
if they did... not important.

Go Jets, Atl, and Cinci!

If they all three win that gives us the number THREE pick (if I did my
math right).

Right now we are drafting either 6th or 7th without any help.

If we beat SD, I think it drops us to 9th no matter what (which might
still be worth it... lol).
