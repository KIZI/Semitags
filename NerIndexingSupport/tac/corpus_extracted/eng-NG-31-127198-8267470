Gator volleyball starts tonight as well, not sure who they're playing.  I'll
have to imagine the tall athleticism in tight short-shorts on the radio,
though.

Apparently the Gators are returning all their starters and have a couple of
highly-hyped freshmen coming in this year, too.

The Gators Coach, Mary Wise, has absolutely unprecedented success at
Florida.  Something like 16 or 17 consecutive SEC titles.  The only one she
didn't get was her very first year.  UF is the UK Basketball (of yore) of
Volleyball.

The defending National Champ and #1 ranked Cornhuskers take on the
Tennnneeeessssseeee Volunteers tonight in the AVCA Showcase. Should be
another great year. The two most recent National Players of the Year
(Sarah Pavan, Chris Houghtelling) anchor a team stacked from top to
bottom with talent. I read the other day that they've been ranked #1
in the polls for the last three years running save for one week (the
final poll of 2005 when they they lost to Washington in the title
game). Remarkable. Oh, BTW, Rachel Schwartz is HAWT! But don't take my
word for it:

You going to the games at all?  I went last year where they were here.

Badgers open at 11 this year - ought to be a very strong team, but
we're in a brutal conference with PSU and the Gophers ranked ahead.
We lost to #4 Texath last year in the playoofs - they were really
young, but super talented - they could be scary good.

And yes - she's cute!

Nah, unfortunately I have to worship from afar (columbus, oh). We got
to see them blow out the buckgals a couple of years ago when they came
to town. It's a tough ticket in Lincoln as they sold all their home
game tickets for the entire season in less than 45 minutes.
