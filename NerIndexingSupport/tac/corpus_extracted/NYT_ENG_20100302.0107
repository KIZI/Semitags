Stabenow and Levin tell Senate committee about need for credit

Detroit News Washington Bureau

Washington -- Michigan Sens. Carl Levin of Detroit and Debbie
Stabenow of Lansing called on a Senate banking committee Tuesday to
work on new legislation that would encourage banks to expand
lending to small businesses.

"In Michigan, our manufacturers are trying to retool and
diversify," Stabenow said in testimony before the Senate Committee
on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.

"They are moving into high growth industries like health care,
defense and clean energy. But they are having trouble growing
because they are having trouble getting credit ... the theory of
'too big to fail' now means that many of our businesses today are
too small to grow."

The appearance of both of Michigan's Democratic senators --
testifying before a panel in the chamber they serve -- was somewhat
of an anomaly; usually, witnesses appearing before committees are
professionals or experts.

But because the effects of Michigan's extended recession are
viewed by lawmakers as emblematic of larger issues rippling through
the nation's economy, the panels of witnesses testifying Tuesday
were heavy on representation from the Great Lakes State; aside from
the two senators on the first panel, Arthur Johnson, chairman and
chief executive of Grand Rapids-based United Bank of Michigan,
spoke on behalf of the American Bankers Association.

Cathleen Nash, president and chief executive of Flint-based
Citizens Republic Bancorp, spoke at a similar congressional hearing
last week.

As of 2007, Michigan small businesses employed nearly 2 million
workers.

Levin said he's heard from a number of small business owners in
Michigan who are having trouble accessing credit to fund normal
operations, which exacerbates an already tough economic
environment.

"When I talk to employers in Michigan, often the first problem
they discuss with me is the difficulty obtaining the capital they
have traditionally relied on to finance their operations: capital
to meet payroll, to finance inventory, to update their equipment or
to expand their businesses," Levin said.

Both senators said they support expanded federal programs to
help community banks expand current lending opportunities for small
businesses.

Stabenow supports an extension of the Small Business
Administration loan guarantee program that's scheduled to expire
this month, as well as an increase in the maximum loan size for
federally-backed loans.
