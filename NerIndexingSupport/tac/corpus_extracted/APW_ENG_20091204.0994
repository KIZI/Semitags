The Republic of Ecuador has sued the Chevron Corp. as the two battle over liability for pollution in the Amazon rainforest.

The suit was filed Thursday at a federal court in Manhattan.

Ecuador is asking the court to block an attempt by Chevron to force their dispute over the environmental damage into international arbitration.

Separately, Chevron is defending itself against a $27 billion lawsuit in Ecuador brought by 30,000 inhabitants of a rainforest where illnesses have been blamed on contamination from oil drilling.

Chevron says Ecuador, not the company, should have to pay any damages.

A message left with Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, California, was not immediately returned.
