Brett Favre Interception, Referees, Send the New Orleans Saints to Miami

If this is the last pass ever thrown by Brett Favre, it will likely stick in his craw for the rest of his life, and deservedly so, for it was one of the worst decisions ever made by a Hall of Fame QB in such a critical game.

How many Super Bowls did he get it done in? And he sure as hell doesn't lay down everytime he is about to be tackled, like someone else * cough* Tom Brady.

The Viking got screwed by activist referees and questionable reviews.

Farve has no excuse. I like the guy, admire his toughness and even his brashness, but even a rookie like Mark Sanchez quickly learned when NOT to throw the ball
 
 
He was still distracted, Favre was thinking about Ben Stillers cum in Marys hair.

That would be one, my dear... a LONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG time ago.

Brett Favre is no Tom Brady, we can agree on that.
 
 
Darrelle Revis was 11 years old when Brett Favre won the Super Bowl.

Yes, we can. Tom Brady can get it done, several times over again.
 
 
Second time Brett gets to "retire" with his last pass being an interception in the NFC Championship game
 
 
It's a little obnoxious to claim that the refs handed that game to New Orleans. The only questionable call, IMO, was the PI based on "catchable", however, it was so flagrant that the Saints would have been saying the same thing if it had gone the other way.

The 4th down run that was bobbled ? The incomplete pass that put them in field goal position ?

Kind of hard to make an effort to "catch" an "uncatchable ball" when you are drilled downfield.

The Vikes got some calls, the Saints got some calls. In particular, the refs were ensuring that Favre was protected. How many flags did the Saints get for personal fouls for hitting Farve. One of those looked legit, the other two probably wouldn't have happened if the quarterback wasn't geriatric.

For the most part, Favre did exactly that. He had one of the best statistical careers of his life. He threw 7 picks all year. Without Favre, there is no way the Vikings are in that game to begin with, let alone have a chance. If the running backs do not fumble six times, they blow the Saints away, even with the picks. Minnesota dominated most of that game.

Having said that, even though he has made less than at any time in his career this year, he still makes ill-advised throws, and he certainly did at the end of regulation.
 
 
Now now... It's not all Brett's fault.

The team failed him and foisted their fate on his shoulders, just like was done in 2006 and 1995. He never has been able to carry the team on his own in a clutch game like that.

Blame AP. Blame the Viking's Defensive line not getting to Brees. Blame Coach Chilly or Bevell. The man did the best he could and was pushed into the same spot he'd been before, and failed.

That said, I'm happy the comedy is done, and the Viking fans can now suffer through the same hell we Packer fans had to deal with for 4 years before we said enough's enough.

so true.as usual,he makes a boneheaded decision that cost them the game just like he did monday night against the Jets.   Had to bring this thread back since its appropriate in what he did in the jets game.  
 
 
Well, his recurrent arm injuries we now find out are probably due to excessive weenie wagging for his cellphone to send to team masseuses.

priceless.   Looks like there are some teammates out there who dont like Farve.Notice how NONE of them came over to see if he was okay despite the fact he was hurt really bad at first?
