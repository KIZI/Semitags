 
 
The frightening truth of why Iran wants a bomb
 
 
What does America do to discourage Iran from being 'irresponsible' with nuclear technology? Plans a nuclear attack against it.

I love America.

More insofar as they are more varied, not more powerful. The need for bombs that destroy continents isn't really there. The weapons suggested for the attack on Iran were bunker busters - they can be described as "nuclear weapons" because they use nuclear technology to heat the tip to such high temperatures that it just melts through the concrete bunker walls, thus destroying things underground.

They never intended to iradiate Tehran.
 
 
God Bless America!

Wrong. The bombs used these days are more powerful than those used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Which is what I was getting at.

But yeah, America responds to Iran in the only language they understand. Right-wing hardlining.

What do you mean "used these days"? With the exception of tests - the results of which none of us could pretend to have access to - the only two used in engagement were over 60 years ago. There's no need for bigger bombs - the US has enough to destory every city in the world. The key now is making far smaller but very powerful munitions. They haven't spent the last 60 years researching it, only to just say "yeah, that's good, but try BIGGER this time!"

Well, in the USA, bigger is better. That goes from their Humvees to their nukes.  

And I'm basing my info on the nuclear arms race during the Cold War. Naturally the bombs will have become more powerful, don't you think? Not least with the invention (then) of the hydrogen bomb.
 
 
I love the ones that go above the atmosphere then separate causing lots of nuclear bombs to strike everywhere.

It would paint a pretty picture in the sky... before getting blown up.
 
 
The US have certainly built far more powerful nuclear weapons in the past 60 years - even if they aren't used in engagement, they're obviously not made for the museum!

The scary thing is how they're hoping to develop lower yield/impact nuclear weapons to blur the line between conventional and nuclear. Worrying times. W.r.t. Iran, where was the world when we needed to discourage the US and the Soviet Union from nuclear weapons? It's all a matter of timing ach.
 
 
Bunker Busters are tactical nuclear weapons, not inter-continental ballistic missiles like those that were pointed across the globe during the cold war.

They aren't armed with nuclear technology in the warheads, as such, but my point is that they are threatening to use this technology in a stand-off over irresponsible use of this technology.
 
 
Frankly, if the US have the military muscle and technology (they do), then there's no argument at all.
 
 
God Bless Iran and its nuclear program
 
 
This is in the wrong forum.
 
 
who cares, TSR server will probably be blown up within months when the war starts. >.<
 
 
Imagine if an international pariah like N. Korea got nukes... oh.
 
 
pathetic really...america got many nuclear bombs..and when iran just wanted to start the nuclear program, the whole world started to talk about it..

Oh please, do some research into Ahmadinejad's regarding Israel and then tell me the world shouldn't be worried.
 
 
America can't stand it when another country is starting to engage into nuclear activities. They are pathetic and Iran should be able to do what they want. Screw G W Bush

The Iranian leader is a fanatical psycho thats why the west dont want nuclear weapons to be made available to Iran.
 
 
Who says their making weapons....i'll admit its not the best, but US should back off....what about Israel, they have nuclear weapons - no inspections or limits on them just because they and america are in each others pockets. That is wrong

So you would like a leader thats dream out wiping another country off the face of the earth to be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.

I havent heard a single Israeli leader say he wants to wipe any country off the face of the earth.
 
 
Its the leaders who bring destruction to their own people.. Iran is not hoping to destroy the world.. If Britain were doing this nuclear program would Bush interfere? I don't think so.

Personally i rather see some redneck Christian like George Bush run the worlds most powerful country instead of a fanatical Muslim like the Iranian leader.

Iran is hoping to destroy Israel, isnt it  
 
 
Brooklyn123 you think Iran should be allowed to do what it wants..BS- NO way. The Iranian leader is a man who should not be allowed to have acesss to nuclear capabilty, he is a crazy Islamic fundamentalist crackpot.

I didnt agree with the US stance on Iraq (because anyone who was clued up knew Iraq militiary machine was crippled and was no threat) but this is a completely differenet situation. Iran is a growing power and should not have any kind of nuclear capabilty, theyre swimming in oil in Iran and do DO NOT NEED nuclear power and a resulting nuclear programme.

You may say we have no right to decide what another country "needs" or not but legal nuclear programmes on our fair planet are governed by the International atomic energy agency who make the rules which everyone must stick to. Iran flouts these rules and sticks 2 fingers up to the world and you think it should be allowed to have nuclear capability..how ridiculous.

Im glad the US proactive enough to see this threat emerging and is willing to take action to protect us all.
 
 
Why would ANY nuclear power want another country to become one? It's completely against their best interest.

That is a rather provocative comment (and in my unprofessional opinion, outright wrong to say).

What is interesting is that Berlusconi was accepted for so long. Yet if a leader like him, leading in the way he does, with such personal wealth and business interests, was a leader of a non-Western country...I fear we would judge by different standards.

Oh i dunno... maybe the fact that they regularly threaten to destroy israel, or the fact that they started testing new torpedoes and missles recently, or the fact that they refuse to comply with requests to stop enriching uranium. Yeah, i'm sure they just want it for energy

yeah i kno about them...just because he sai that doesnt mean that other countries such US and Israel dont have intention to use their nuclear weapon....US and Israel are two main countries that currently threating the muslims world..and they afraid that this muslim country will stand up against them...other country such as Libya, Saudi n others all have been under them....u can see the example man, when Hamas won the election in Palestine, they just stop the budget to help palestine...even Hamas was chosen by THE PALESTINE PEOPLE!..and its a VERY BIG win For them..not just like 5-10% different in votes...man PALESTINIAN DO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED and they know what best for them...dont let the media decieve ur mind.. i mean u all see the so called militant...man they just trying to get their own country back, I think u all would do the same...example what do the Palestinians have? an army? naah crap..see how can they defend themselves?, other than being secretives or what typical ppl call it as terrorist and militant.. u can also how powerless the palestinian police are when the israeli army just came and arrest them...they dont even have their rights!...they dont just go blow themselves up with now reasons...there are somethings that really matters that leading them to do that...i mean even Yasseer arafat turned into the US scarecrow...just to website such yotube or watever and search what have the israelis done to the palestinians...

heres one of em..some rap from palestine..it might be crap but hey, listen to what they wanna say..positive thinking rite?

If the US and Israel intended to use their nukes against Iran they would have done so already.

 
US and Israel are two main countries that currently threating the muslims world..and they afraid that this muslim country will stand up against them...other country such as Libya, Saudi n others all have been under them....
 

A threat to the muslim world? How? The US has stated countless times that we are not fighting a war against Islam.

 
u can see the example man, when Hamas won the election in Palestine, they just stop the budget to help palestine...even Hamas was chosen by THE PALESTINE PEOPLE!..and its a VERY BIG win For them..not just like 5-10% different in votes...man PALESTINIAN DO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED and they know what best for them...dont let the media decieve ur mind..
 

Hmm yeah i just can't imagine why any country wouldn't want to send money to Hamas... Haha don't worry, the media isn't decieving anyone. They report the stories that Hamas creates. Hamas is a bunch of terrorist thugs- their charter calls for the destruction of Israel.

 
i mean u all see the so called militant...man they just trying to get their own country back, I think u all would do the same...example what do the Palestinians have? an army? naah crap..see how can they defend themselves?
 

How can they defend themselves? Are you serious? Yeah, it's not like they have any weapons of anything.

 
other than being secretives or what typical ppl call it as terrorist and militant.. u can also how powerless the palestinian police are when the israeli army just came and arrest them...they dont even have their rights!...they dont just go blow themselves up with now reasons.
 

Oh i know they don't blow themselves up for no reason- they are under the diluted impression that killing as many innocent people as they can is a good thing. How you can even begin to support that is totally and utterly beyond me.

You try to make it sound like the Israeli army targets innocent people walking down the street, we both know that there is zero truth in that.

Although I find it hard to support either 'side', the US's policy in the Middle East could be seen as somewhat aggressive towards Islamic nations. That said, it would be difficult not to be, it's a very troubling issue. It can also be argued that there is a very strong Israeli lobby in the US, and I know there is a strong Saudi Arabian influence as well...but it does add further confusion as to what the US is really trying to promote!

Desperate circumstances can make people do things that we might perceive as strange. The only problem being we can't really understand it - and that would be our flaw.

israels policy of an eye for an eye makes the israeli state just as bad as any suicide bomber. They know innocents will get killed when they lauch their all too often air strikes yet they continue doing so. So don't make the palestinians the only bad guys here cos both sides are as bad as each other. The difference is the zionists started this all off.

Haha okay, so what should Israel do? Just sit back and allow their citizens to blown to pieces by suicide bombers? Please. Israel does not target innocent people, suicide bombers do. And the last line of your post is total BS, I suggest looking things up like the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, The Suez War, The six day war, the war of attrition, the yom kippur war and the Lebanon war.
 
 
Anyway, we seem to be pretty far off topic.

In Ahmadinejad's analysis, the rising Islamic "superpower" has decisive advantages over the infidel. Islam has four times as many young men of fighting age as the West, with its ageing populations. Hundreds of millions of Muslim "ghazis" (holy raiders) are keen to become martyrs while the infidel youths, loving life and fearing death, hate to fight. Islam also has four-fifths of the world's oil reserves, and so controls the lifeblood of the infidel. More importantly, the US, the only infidel power still capable of fighting, is hated by most other nations.

According to this analysis, spelled out in commentaries by Ahmadinejad's strategic guru, Hassan Abassi, known as the "Dr Kissinger of Islam", President George W Bush is an aberration, an exception to a rule under which all American presidents since Truman, when faced with serious setbacks abroad, have "run away". Iran's current strategy, therefore, is to wait Bush out. And that, by "divine coincidence", corresponds to the time Iran needs to develop its nuclear arsenal, thus matching the only advantage that the infidel enjoys.

Moments after Ahmadinejad announced "the atomic miracle", the head of the Iranian nuclear project, Ghulamreza Aghazadeh, unveiled plans for manufacturing 54,000 centrifuges, to enrich enough uranium for hundreds of nuclear warheads. "We are going into mass production," he boasted.

The Iranian plan is simple: playing the diplomatic game for another two years until Bush becomes a "lame-duck", unable to take military action against the mullahs, while continuing to develop nuclear weapons.

 http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article...136638,00.html 

IRAN has formed battalions of suicide bombers to strike at British and American targets if the nation’s nuclear sites are attacked. According to Iranian officials, 40,000 trained suicide bombers are ready for action.

Is there anyone, like Blair, willing to rule out military action against Iran?
What sort of peace will inaction sustain?
 
 
 
 
 
For God sake if Iran continues to push its luck with absurd statements and does have intentions to build nuclear warheads for illegitamite reasons i wouldnt mind if the US shows the Iranians their full power.

An uneasy peace? Like the 50 years of peace with had with the Eastern block? But peace nevertheless.

Because, I suspect, the country is sick to death with running around after America and helping to execute its extraordinarily belicose foreign policies.

Why doesn't somebody else jump into bed with the Americans this time? How about the Israelis? Iran has stated that Israel should be wiped off the map, not the UK, so perhaps they should be the ones joining Uncle Sam in his newest adventure.

I do believe a threat exists but I don't think every single threat on the planet needs to be solved by military action. We really need to access the seriousness of threats in a grown up manner rather than treat every one of them as a reason to go to war.

We lived under a shadow for 50 years; real threat, Soviet tanks along the Rhine; Khruschev banging his shoe on the table at the UNGA; the nation being bombared with government advisories ("public service broadcasts" I think they were called) about "what to do in the event of a nuclear attack" And yet the politicians of the day were able to manage the threat without blowing one another up.

Goodness, the USSR even put nuclear warheads on Cuba and pointed them to Miami, 70 miles away. How much of a threat was that? And yet the threat was managed; war did not break out.

Have we completely lost the art of diplomacy?

True, but this is a highly sensitive area given the threat of war between the US (the UK's cheif ally) and Iran.

And the comments were actually about reprts that Iran would launch a blizzard of suicide bombers on British forces in Iraq, and prehaps even in the UK itself. I'm well aware that it is to be taken with a crates worh of sodium chloride but the fact is UK-Iranian relations are almost as poor as US-Iranian relations.

Still not cause enough to declare war over; a bit of a "did you spill my pint?" approach to foreign policy IMO.

True, which is why the UK wouldn't do anything. But were the US to get involved, the poor relations would be an ample pretext for the UK to join with the US.

You mean that if the UK/US use tactical nuclear weapons against Iran the Iranians actually plan to retaliate? That's outrageous!!

Well they plan to retaliate in by non-conventional means, e.g. sending masses of state-sponsered suicide bombers against civilian targets.

Depends on the political make up of the government at the time (c.f. Britain's attitude to the Vietnam war).

In fairness, how would you expect Iran to retaliate? Use the mighty Iranian Navy to cross the oceans and invade Britain and the US?

AA cannons/missiles?

Or do what they did 20 years earlier and counter-invade Iraq.

I dont mind the remarks but being in the situation Iran is makes the marks more concerning. Personally i dont know how the allies could invade since Iran is a large country with a large military and a successful invasion would come at the costs of countless civilian lives.

Yes. Interestingly, it's often not mentioned that the US had a whole bunch of them in Turkey pointing at the USSR before that...
 
 
I think that the US chose the eaisest of the three on its axis of evil and now it has left itself very over-stretched and unable to deal with Iran.

If I were in charge of the US I would certainly be ratcheting up the tension and pressure on Iran through the UN.

does anyone have any other ideas?
 
 
If only we hadn't wasted our time on iraq....
 
 
The president of Iran said he wants to "wipe Israel off the map" and denied the "holocaust".

Is letting him have bomb a good idea?

Because clearly we should wait until Iran has nuclear weapons within 50 miles of our national interests before we decide that maybe we dont want the world's largest terrorist sponsor, and declared flag bearer for Islamic imperialism, to have a nuclear weapon.

Amazing the number of people who say 'never again' and yet would wait for Hitler to occupy continental europe before acknowledging that maybe he was a threat that required action. Diplomatic action of course.

Now don't be silly   I clearly don't imply that anywhere. Just an oppurtunity for you to go off on one and make yourself sound clever. And that hackneyed sarcasm is annoying. Also, I thought you weren't a fan of the strawman technique?

Why not? Israel isn't our problem, and it would restore the balance of power to the Middle East. And why is denying the Holocaust such an unspeakable crime? Would you react the same way if he denied that millions of white Europeans were murdered by Jewish Bolsheviks in the Soviet Union?

Israel is America's problem - look at the jewish lobby there (read "The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy" by Professor Walt and John Mearsheimer).

That is why America cares.

I don't, excepting that where else will jews go?

  You must be new?

I did not say it was a crime, but I think that lefties care about Israel so said about it.
 
 
Firstly, if you think this is just about Israel, you're severely retarded. Iran has missiles that can reach British forces in the region and will probably soon have the capacity to hit British forces in the Med and our allies in continental Europe.

The balance of power in the Middle East would change dramatically, in a very bad way for the UK, with allies in the region and pro-Western governments having to suddenly seriously take in to account the will of the mad mullahs who run Iran.
And where the hell does this "Jewish Bolsheviks" murdering millions thing, come from? Considering that religion was severely curtailed by communism and many many Jews were either killed or fled from Russia before, during and after WW2, to slip the word 'Jewish' in there and connect it with the mass-murders of communism is intellectually dishonest and smacks of an attempt to make Jews guilty of something they clearly weren't.

So there, that's why I said what I did.

Just a new account, but I haven't been here in months and I don't remember seeing you before. Anyway, at least we've cleared that up. I thought you were a Jewish sympathiser trying to peddle war with Iran for a minute.

No, this is solely about Israel. If Israel thinks Iran is a threat, then fine, but let them fight their own wars.

Yeah, as opposed to the mad Jewish supremacists in Israel? I think somebody needs to get their priorities straight. What's the point in worrying about Iran when there are religious nuts in Israel armed with about 200 nuclear weapons?

The communists in the Soviet Union were Jews from top to bottom, as you well know, so don't play dumb. Communism is a Jewish ideology, it was a Jewish communist who murdered the Tsar and his family, and the Bolshevik members were about 99% Jewish, so don't feign innocence please. You're not talking to some Shabbos goy here.
 
 
I dont think Iran is really a big threat. Despite the Telegraph getting very exited and publishing pictures of nuclear bombs exploding and taking every opportunity they get to make a fuss, Iran is till 10 years off developing nuclear weapons. Israel has 400.
The barage of US threats doesnt help the atmosphere.

You seem to think that there is no need for any country to aid the plight of the people in any other.

Thank God that just over 60 years ago, the US and many other countries didn't think so, otherwise, you and myself would be having this debate in German.

I have to say, I for the most part agree with Vienna. The greatest nuclear threat WE face, is a nuke in the hands of a radical theocratic regime, full of adherents for whom a nuclear holocaust is nothing more than a fast lane to paradise.

The only thing that was in our favour with the USSR was the mutual fear of mutually assured destruction. That was the safety cap.

Religious fanatics harbor no such worry.

We should be concerned. Very concerned.

However I think St. Louis is probably pretty safe Howie

Not exactly HIGH on the list.

Because Israel ISN'T run by religious nuts? Israel is a full democracy with full freedom of religions and is quite secular in nature, with far more Israelis describing themselves as secular than as religious. Israel has never threatened to annihilate another UN Member State, has never threatened to use nuclear weapons or used them as a bargaining tool. You clearly know less than nothing about Israel.

Maybe they did, maybe they didn't, I'm not an expert. What I do note is that everyone else on the list is denoted by NATIONALITY whereas the alleged Jews are qualified only by their RELIGION. Did they not have nationalities? Or are they simply 'Jews' before all else, everyone else is known by what country they were citizens of, but the Jews just get stamped with 'Jew'? You know, for a German, you're intimating some very unpleasant things which I'm pretty sure are illegal in your country.

Well, check out the link in his sig. That political party is rather interesting -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationa..._Germany_(NPD) .

"The National Democratic Party of Germany (German: Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands, NPD) is the largest far right political party in Germany. "

"On July 21, 2006, NPD members plan to march in support of the Iranian national football team at the 2006 World Cup in Leipzig. Their support is due to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's recent declaration that The Holocaust was "a myth", matching the NPD's own Holocaust denial."

Lenin was the great-grandson of Moishe Itskovich Blank and the grandson of Srul Moishevich Blank. At his baptism, Blank changed his name and patro-nymic to Aleksandr Dmitrievich.

Lenin's Jewish origin on his maternal grandfather's side became, after his death, a matter of controversy between Lenin's sisters and Stalin. In a letter to Stalin, Anna, Lenin's elder sister, wrote: "It is probably no secret for you that the research on our grandfather shows that he came from a poor Jewish family, that he was, as his baptismal certificate says, the son of a 'Zhitomir burgher, Moishe Blank' and this fact could serve in combating anti-Semitism."

Furthermore, she claimed, that Lenin's Jewish origins were "further confirmation of the exceptional abilities of the Semitic tribe... Lenin always valued the Jews highly."

Stalin replied: "Not one word about it."

Im afraid the estimates are talking months as opposed to decades. Im interested to know why a nuclear weapon in the hands of the worlds largest sponsor of terrorism, who has declared it would use terrorism against British interests, which would have significant influence over 4/5ths of the worlds oil supply, which believes in a global jihad to Islamify the Western world, would not actually constitute a threat to a nation that rely's on the US for its own defence.

That wasn't even CLOSE to the implication of my post. It was that the US came to the aid of the allies. An action without which we would have been conquered by the Germans. As such, it is an example of onecountry fighting in the war of another, most sane people would agree, to the benefit of the continent.

Either you think the US was wrong to intervene, or you approve, selectively, the intervention of one country in the welfare of another.

Er, no. Israel is a homeland for the Jews whose ultimate aim is not to be annihilated. A small proportion of the population believes in the 'greater Israel' idea, the majority (including the government and the clear majority of MKs) clearly do not. Ignoramus.

That's a complete misrepresentation and you know it you lying piece of ****. Israel simply does not have a civil institution of marriage. Therefore only religious marriage exists, so religious intermarriage is only possible to the extent that religions allow it. Israel recognises civil unions carried out in other countries.

Either you think the US was wrong to intervene, or you approve, selectively, the intervention of one country in the welfare of another.

 

you believe that?

The US only entered because of Japan attacking it. The US didn't care about you lot in Europe!

Well, there were mixed motives I think. Japan was allied with Germany, and they went in late on, after pearl harbour

That's woefully historically inaccuracte.

Not to mention he fact that it flies in the face of all logic. Why did the US send ANY troops to Europe then?

Why not send them ALL to the pacific?

The claim was that there was intelligence suggesting they could use chemical weapons on the battlefield within 45 minutes of a command to do so. Im willing to take the word of the intelligence community rather than take your "Liberal Democrat" approach to defense policy.

they realised the "allies" were going to win. Europe would remember if the US had not sent troops so they sent some so they would look good after the war.

Again. Inaccurate. Without the US's help it was by NO means clear tht the allies would win. In fact, it looked rather bleak for them.

So what? We have weapons which can be deployed in 'x' minutes. Does that mean any country who has some vague idea we may be a threat can come and invade?

so why didn't they enter earlier and help to defeat the Führer? Because they waited to see which would win more likely.

I dont see how that determines whether a) Iran is a threat and b) that military action should be accepted as a means to oppose that threat. I cant see the West, as it stands today, facing off Iran over a long period of time, irrespect of whether they have a nuclear weapon. Western weakness and the sort of 1935 thinking promoted by Howard is what the Iranians are hoping for.

I'm sure you are Vienna. The problem is you are also more willing to take the word of any politician that is too bone idle and incompetent to explore diplomatic avenues for more than 2 days before giving up.

I'm not sure if I have a liberal-democrat approach to defence policy (whatever that is) but your approach seems simply to be "war at all costs" every time.

I would remind you that "jaw jaw" and not "war war" is the reason that Europe and lots of other parts of the world are not badly maintained nuclear wastelands as we speak. It is that way thanks to the efforts of people who could be bothered to sit around a table exploring alternatives and people with wisdom enough to put threats into perspective.

Yes, but it won't allow civil unions in Israel. Since you claimed that Israel is a secular, democratic state, the fact that they only permit religious marriages between two Jews kind of contradicts that.

Well there isn't any point in military action if you know that the difference you make will only be incredibly temporary, before a return to the same worrying situation, is there? At least with Iraq, there's the 'domino' theory that the democracy that they've attempted to install will eventually settle down and spread across the region(which tbf, looks ridiculously optimistic right now), maybe reproducing positive long term effects.

Whats the point of diplomacy if you reject the possibility of military action and the intelligence that both diplomacy and force are founded on?

Have you been living in a bunker for the last three months? Or do Iranian attacks on British and US soldiers, funding of terrorists and declarations of war against an ally not constitute sabre rattling? Perhaps you can quote me a member of the US administration declaring their support for a nuclear strike on Iran? The talk on our part has been of diplomacy. The talk on the part of Iran has been aggression from the off.

In response to your earlier questions: A liberal democrat approach is to wait for a nuclear warhead to hit Parliament before we consider responding. I havent chosen war in this situation, I just havent ruled it out. I'm not willing to spend the next 50 years being threatened by Islamic imperialists and suicide bombers with nuclear weapons.

We really have two options if Iran doesn't stop being naughty. We declare war and live with the consequences or we learn to live an "uneasy peace" as we have very often done in the past and keep dialogue open.

I'm never reject outright the possibility of war but I'm obviously not so eager to get tucked in as you. Your problem is that war is a central theme to your idea of a decent foreign policy. You start out by planning for war and diplomacy plays second fiddle every time.

The US, if it resorts to military force, will carry out limited strikes by air- the US does not want and cannot afford or sustain a land war or a protracted war. The American regime has too few troops (see Iraq), is afraid of the downsides of a draft military (see Vietnam), has too much debt and not quite enough cash (see Iraq again, see also deep and continuing tax cuts, accompanied by dizzying indebtedness, in the US), and no allies in an Iran adventure, except for Israel, its client state in the Middle East (see alliances squandered in the Iraq adventure). Air strikes from Israel into Iran may also be difficult- Iran and back is at the limit of the Israeli AF range. All things considered, let's negotiate. In any case Ahmadinejad is playing to the lowest common denominators in his audience. Nasser did the same in the same bombastic way in 1966-1967. The pronouncements were inflated and hollow in addition to being plain nasty.

Childish.
 
 
There's a clear and marked difference between letting Hitler walk all over Europe, and not going postal whenever a small rogue nation starts getting uppity. The former was one of the greatest mistakes in history, the latter is a staple, tried-and-tested piece of diplomatic wisdom.

When Iran starts building an army to rock the world, or starts casually annexing neighboring states, then you can bring out your appeasement references. Until then, a continuation of diplomatic efforts is an entirely legitimate and sensible way of dealing with a small nation showing us its angry face. There's a difference between courage and madness.

Don't get me wrong, we need to keep an eye on this situation. But talk of tactical nukes and so forth is worrying...it does present the world with an odd image: dealing with a supposedly unstable, trigger-happy nation, by being unstable and trigger-happy. It's not as simple as that of course but one should take responsibility for one's own PR: that's how its going to be seen around the world. And understandably so. If America wants to take the war on terror seriously this is not a good way of going about it - their biggest enemy, after all, is not war factories or enemy nations but the worldwide anti-American sentiment that has led to a climate in which events like 9/11 can take place.

Additionally, there are a lot of wild, overblown statements about Iran's up-coming nuclear ability being thrown around in this debate, as is to be expected with such issues. Some people seem to have a rather naive understanding of what it is to be a nuclear power...it's not like civ 4, where as soon as you research the technology 'nuclear power' you can start lobbing ICBMs all over the world. They've managed to enrich uranium. Now it can't be predicted with exact accuracy, but we're looking at several years before they can properly be said to have the ability to launch nuclear strikes. They're gearing up an industry at the moment, beggining the preperations - it's not like they're working on the last little component and then as soon as that's done the missile tilts upwards and little red button starts glowing.

The world is not a GI Joe cartoon, the West needs to calm down. Iran also need to calm down, but it's looks as though they're pretty far gone up the old insanity road, making it even more important that we keep our cool.

And? That's not Israel failing to give full rights to non-Jews (as you claimed), that's Israel, a State specifically given to the Jews by the UN as a Jewish homeland for Jews, giving Jews preferential treatment for citizenship of the Jewish State. That's hardly unreasonable as a position.

And you prove once again you're a moron who knows nothing about Israel. Israel does NOT only permit religious marriage between two Jews. It permits religious marriage FULL STOP. Christian, Muslim or Jew, all sorts of religious marriage are permitted in Israel - how else would the 20% of the Israeli population who aren't Jewish get married?

OK, firstly, Israel would not nuke the "rest of the world out of spite", that's a complete lie and is insupportable. Israel maintains a last-ditch nuclear response in case its back is ever against the wall with no other option, but that is a very far cry from "threatening" other States or using nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip. Secondly, it clearly would not nuke "the rest of the world", it may go for advancing armies and the states attacking it, but you're being ridiculous.

Bad analogy. It should be, if there is a man who has a gun and a man is trying to reach for one, then personally I'd go for the man with gun first, especially if it takes the other man up to 10 years to reach for the gun.

Well there isn't any point in military action if you know that the difference you make will only be incredibly temporary, before a return to the same worrying situation, is there? At least with Iraq, there's the 'domino' theory that the democracy that they've attempted to install will eventually settle down and spread across the region(which tbf, looks ridiculously optimistic right now), maybe reproducing positive long term effects.

Henry Ford is a well-known and infamous anti-semite and was even a fan of the Nazis. David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, is a well-known anti-semite and all-around racist.
You're going to back up an anti-semitic forgery by citing some of the most infamous anti-semites around? Brilliant.

(Also, it may interest you to know that Ford retracted the International Jew and his expressed support for the Protocols later in his life - doesn't do much for credibility when the supposed author retracts what he said).

Oh for Gods sake we should have given your grandads generation a better a$$ whooping
 
 
iran wont start a war, it has defence agreements with north-korea, russia and china, its up to bush whose blatantly planning another scheme to put his all-time record-low popularity higher with the republicans about the time he's up for election.

Iran has an intention to throw israel's power off, but its clearly non-nuclear, any rational person will come to the same conclusion since the winds will swing straight over iran.
A war with iran would prove devastating since some of us's allies will not support the war since they know how foolish it would be since its not comparible to iraq's whose army was devastated by the gulf war and had suffered sanctions, whereas iran has not. Any bombing on iran would cause terrible knock-on effects around the world and would crush america's economy even more then it will if iran continues its plans to export in euros as iraq had also intended. US should try to negotiate a dollar-euro trading situation instead of foolishly chasing up the WMD threat again, which people are basically sick and tired of hearing of, although sometimes its the only thing that will get people scared enough.
But whats going to happen when they realise they dont have enough volunteers to send to war, and they start drafting people whose experience of combat is tied down to an xbox. **** will hit the fan, and it wont be pleasant for anyone. So threatening war will only please iran, better to forget about mainting a zionistic control over the middle-east and secure americas own position as a super power and work to a more peaceful future by supporting negotiations with pa and israel who without having double standards, are clearly as bad as eachother, so dont talk about this "no negotiating with terrorists" excuse. But, honestly fat chance bush's party will give up its power without sacrificing a percentage of its population again...

hopefully congress will see sence to stop him, good luck to the world, dont see why thousands of people will die because of one man's ambitions.

just my two pence..
 
 
I love the off-hand dismissal of "the WMD threat" when Iran is literally busy screaming "Hey, look, we're enriching uranium, look over here, us us, you know that stuff you use for nukes, we're making that!" And the anti-war brigade stick their heads in the sand and scream "BUSH IS MAKING IT UP".
 
 
soo...lots of countires use enrich uranium since its vaslty better economically and thats every countries intention. they are innocent until proven guilty, which they havent been, and cant be until 3 years from now by the minium...*sigh*. you want a concern about wmd, how about usa supporting india to facilitate its own production which is going to piss of pakistan and will retaliiate.
Even if iran's alledged intentions to possess wmd become reality, it wont change a thing, they use them, then israel uses them, then north korea uses them then usa uses them. Its not going to happen ~ just reliving the cold war..so how about prioritising our concerns with lives over cash and power... for once and not beliving everything the government tells you. UK government lied to its citizens about the safety of its nuclear power plants in the early 20th century to make them accept it, doesnt mean its the wrong thing to do, or the right thing, but it happens. Use your own mind. dont forget iraq war which is STILL hapening...

The threat doesn't come from having a nuclear capability but the likelihood using it.
 
 
I disagree. Iran having a nuclear capability as a threat would staggeringly alter the whole power-balance in the Middle East which would have global repercussions. It would be able to shield its other actions from reprisals and take whatever action it wanted by waving around nuclear weapons at those who challenged them.

Funnily enough I don't fancy wating for Iran to actually have nuclear weapons before deciding they're "guilty" and something needs to be done. Somehow that just doesn't seem sensible.

The US is helping India with civilian nuclear power. Plus, both India and Pakistan ALREADY have nuclear weapons, so why would the Pakistanis be pissed about India getting a bit more help? And how would they "retaliate" exactly?

So, basically, your objection is that Israel will no longer be the only country in the ME that can wave its nuclear weapons around.

Israel DOESN'T wave its nuclear weapons around, that's the point. Israel still maintains strategic ambiguity, it has never confirmed or denied having nuclear weapons. If it wanted to wave them around then it'd come out and go 'we got nukes, do what we say!', but it doesn't. Considering Iran's current policy of screaming it to the world everytime one of its nuclear scientists takes a leak, it's pretty safe to assume that they won't suddenly shut up and refuse to talk once they go nuclear, far more likely they'll scream and threaten even more.

In actuality Im more worried about who may get their hands on Iran's nukes. It's not beyond the realm of possibilities that they would provide Hammas, Al Qaeda, or some other group with nuclear material.

Even if they DID attack Israel instead, that would simply suck in the US, the UK, Europe, and spawn some more wonderfully waky theories about how Israel nuked their own people in league with the free Masons, Ameircans and the surviving members of Earth Wind and Fire, all so as to have an excuse to attack Iran.  

Not exactly something I like the sound of.

Can you really say the same of Iran?

I actually have to agree that the US has spent its political, financial, and military capital in the wrong place.

Would it be nice if Iraq was a strong liberal democracy? Sure. Will it happen - maybe - but looks like it might not. Was it the most dangerous threat to the west? No. No way.

While in hindsight it does look like the war with Iraq wasn't worth fighting, your reason is not a very good one. You shouldn't attack someone just because they're the biggest threat. Often the biggest threats are too powerful to attack. You attack those that pose a significant threat and who can be destroyed at a relatively low cost.

Depends on how you look at it. What would be more crippling to the American economy? Another 9/11 type terrorist attack, of the double or tripling of petrol prices?

That's not really what I said though. I didnt say you HAD to attack the biggest threat. I was merely stating that there MAY have been better places to expend that capital. IMO, Iran would have been a better place. It wouldnt have necessarily required full scale invasion, but perhaps selectie destruction of nuclear sights, a la the Israelis vs Sadam.

Regardless, i dont think anyone could class Iraq as "at a relatively low cost".

Indeed. Hand one off to a militant group and gain some plausible deniability.
 
 
Anyone who claims that the US took no regard of the plight of the Allies before they entered WW2 needs to go away and read some history.

Was it pure altrusim? No. Were there other factors? Yes. Did they umm and ahh for a while? Yes. Were there those in Congress who were entirely against helping out? Yes.

Does that mean that the desire to help played no part. Abso-fockinlootly-not

The full details of Iran's nuclear program weren't known in March 2003. And how do you think it would look if America attacked Iran while it was led by a reformist (granted, his power was more symbolic than real)?

Especially since Lend-Lease and Destroyers-for-Bases took place before December '41; the US was also in a full-out naval war with Germany from '40.

No - clearly not. But the truth is that the US didnt need to invade Iraq to ensure that Iraq could supply oil to them. They could have lifted sanctions, made up with sadam, sold him some Amrams, and guzzled lots and lots of the black stuff.

However, I think that most Americans would be more concerned about nuclear attack than high oil prices.

Lets be honest though - invading iraq will not mean that oil prices are cut by a third (ie if they would tripple otherwise).

I agree. I never said it was patent at the time. But it is arguable one might have foreseen that there WERE better places to use up the capital. Not to mention the fact that the biggest threat to the US comes from Nuclear attack.

However, I was merely making the point that Iraq was not the best place to focus. Whether that was something that could have been known at the time, is another thing.

it was clear early on that the US was on the side of the European Allies.

I think Bush was far more concerned with spreading democracy (on the assumption that spreading democracy to Iraq would have a domino effect and lead to democracy in the entire Middle East) than with nuclear attacks that everyone knew Iraq wasn't capable of.

A minority opinion it seems.

However one that I have consistently subscribed to. Call him misguided, but I am of the opinion that Bush genuinely thinks that enforced democracy is the panacea for the ME's ills.

Again, it's not that simple.

First, we need to assume that we're putting the propaganda stick away. No one here is going to sell anyone else here on some cent laden one liner. Most of us are smarter than that. Let's cut the PC, shall we?

No, the United States didn't need to invade Iraq to secure oil. But, what is better long term? To lease or to buy? The bottom line is that the United States has an "ally"/puppet in Iraq now, and when push comes to shove, and the demand for oil goes through the roof, we hold a slight advantage on other oil dependant nations around the world.

No one said we were trying to cut oil prices now.

(Again, I'm not saying this was the pretext for war, but the repercussions of it reveal the aforementioned. /Add one pence to the "Yay" side.)

I abhor PCness getting in the way of the truth, but I disagree with the red part of your post.

The elections in Iraq are certianly not producing results conducive to the US's interests, or at least not the kind of results they would choose if tey had the power.

The fact of the matter is that a "puppet democracy" is much much harder to establish than a "puppet dictatorship". It would have been easier to conrol Sadam than a pro-Iranian led government.

No. Its not what I want at all. I'm not championing nuclear proliferation in the ME. All I'm doing is questioning the wisdom of attacking every country who won't tow the line in keeping with our vision of how the ME should look and suggesting that such decisions should be based on a real analysis of the risks that are posed rather than a dogmatic "war first" foreign policy.

Its about weighing the odds. It's common sense.....

a) Iran gets nuclear weapons and immediately fires them at allied country(s).
b) Iran gets a nuclear weapons but does nothing with them.

Now, a) would be bad - very bad, but b) we could live with.

What is the chance of a) or b) happening?

If the chance of a) happenning is very very slight would it be good foreign policy to attack Iran today, and deal with all the ramifications (increased ME instability - civil war - billions and billions spent - thousands of lives lost etc etc) for decades to come?

As Kenny Rogers might say "You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to run..........

The road to democracy and stability takes far longer than 3 years in most cases. If Iraq manages it in 15 it will be ahead of the curve.

It's give and take. But, Iraq undoubtedly relies on the United States for protection, and the US on Iraq for oil. Parallels could be drawn to an elected official who's best friend is a billionaire. Yeah, he might not control him, but it sure makes things a lot easier when you are tight and don't have to worry about politics getting in the way.

I have no doubt that the US has influence in Iraq. Patently.

However, if you think that the US has a safe and cheap oil supply guaranteed in Iraq, then the Bush administration is in for a nasty wake up call. Iran has and will most likely continue to have HEAVY infuence politially in Iraq. The Iranians are quite happy to threaten the US with oil as an economic weapon, what makes you think its so unlikely a Shia led Iraqi government would be so loathe to do the same?

It may not happen, but the US could have had much better access to oil with Sadam in power, than a democratially elected and accoutnable group of policians.

All in all, a 200billion dollar war for oil when you have better prospects selling weapons to the CURRENT dictator and making nice, would be odd IMO.

If the US hadnt invaded Iraq, then it would have been a lot easy to contemplate such a thing.

Compared to Iran yes, but still worth noting. And, like has been said, the occupation of Iraq was a better sell, was probably a lot cheaper, was closer to the already allied Saudis, and provides a central location.

And, like I said, it wasn't the main/only pretext for war. It balanced into the equation, again, like I said, which is not so simple.

If you trade for a less talented forward, but open up more cap room for a better back up goalie, is it worth letting go of a better, higher paid forward? Relativity.

Personally, I don't agree with that rationale, but there were plenty of academics from almost every part of the IR theoretical spectrum who argued that spreading democracy should be the main objective of US foreign policy. Some of them didn't endorse the Iraq war, but taking their theories (that democracy was in the interest of the US and the world) to the logical extreme would suggest that the US should use any means necessary to bring about democracy, especially in strategically important parts of the world.

People are too quick to assume the existence of conspiracies now adays. A quick look over the writings of Bush's political advisors from long before they made it to power clearly suggests that they believed in democratic promotion at all costs.

But when comparing before and afters - it ISNT a plus - if anything it makes oil MORE of a problem. I just dont see how instaling a government less easy to control would be a GOOD step when you want access to cheap oil?

This is the main argument in these lunatic student marchers who all claim "NO WAR FOR OIL". I mean... fine be against the war... but dont make up **** about themotivation when there is no evidence. (not you BTW - the marchers).

How old are you out of interest?

yes they COULD HAVE but in the late 30s they werent really in much of a position. They had to BUILD 100,000 planes FOLLOWING the attack on Pearl Harbour. They created an air force from scratch. The great depression had both:

a) lasting economic effects
b) lasting psychological facts that meant many didnt want to enter another war.

Many who were AGAINST the war, rgue, rightly IMO if the premise was true, that as it WAS a war for oil, it was immoral, as killing thousands of people in order to bolster your oil supply was babaric.

The truth is though, that the war was NOT logically the best route to take if oil was a factor.

Duh. We kidnaped Nostradamus and kept him cryogenically frozen (Yeah, we had the technology WAY back then) and only open him up for major questions such as this one. DUH.

He's a close and careful student of History.

Just as long as its the History of some addled anti-semite.

a) lasting economic effects
b) lasting psychological facts that meant many didnt want to enter another war.

WE had to build an airforce from scratch!

I say that it will eventually be in the best interests of the United States. Maybe not now, but if current trends continue, there will be no such thing as having enough allies with oil. And, Saddam wasn't exactly a friend of the United States.

Well clearly its idiotic to tell you that, in the same way that white Ameircans shouldn't feel the least bit guilty for slavery, or the Italians for the disapora.

But if you ARE an anti-semite, as you seem to be, then you have good reason to feel guilty.

This is the main argument in these lunatic student marchers who all claim "NO WAR FOR OIL". I mean... fine be against the war... but dont make up **** about themotivation when there is no evidence. (not you BTW - the marchers).

 

But given the importance of oil, how rich Iraq is in it, and the fact it seems unlikely that the US would want democracy in that region out of pure altruism, especially given the costs to them to embark on the war, isn't it a fairly reasonable supposition?

But very little oil is sold bilaterally.

The fact is that as long as Iraq is producing oil, the US and every other oil consuming country benefits.

The REAL way to get oil on the cheap is to install a puppet dictator, prop him up, and reap the benefits.

it makes no sense to install a Iran-friendly governemnt long term if you care about oil supply.

Of course it wasn't out of altruism. Bush believed that spreading democracy to the Middle East would make the area more stable, making a US military presense less necessary and minimizing the risk of future oil disruptions. The immediate goal was democracy in Iraq however.

White americans should not feel guilty for slavery because they did NOT do it - it happened years ago.

No. Not really. It isnt a choice between altruism and oil. Bush, IMO, thinks tht installing a democracy in the ME, will help spread it, stablise the region, and mainly, help prevent radicalism, terrorism, and protect the US from more 9/11s.

You an get oil very easily from a dictatorship/monarchy. Why do you think the US is so friendly with the House of Saud?

If that is your only goal. But, the consequences of supporting a prop-up-puppet outright in this day in age seems a little risky politically speaking, don't you think? Especially considering that obtaining oil isn’t the only objective?

Why is it risky? Has Bush paid any price for the American relationship with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, or Jordan? Human rights violations tend to not stay in the news for more than a few weeks.

I just think it is highly unlikely that the US would have cosnidered oil supply muh when it decided to blow billions on installing a govenrment in a highly sectarian country with a real danger of civil war, in the face of the international community.

perhaps in some dark recess of someone's mind oil factored in. Ill never know - but it would have been a fairly illogial decision if it had.

I'm in sympathy with your post, but FYI, Bush can't run again- he can only serve 8 years, 2 terms, and his time is up in 2008. Not that this matters really, he's just a front man, Cheney is runnng the Government. There are lots of figureheads who could take Bush's place.

You are all mad.

Iran doesn't have a bomb, and there is NO proof that it does want one. Yet Israel has several of them. The US has them and uses them.In fact don't all of the permenent members on the SC have them? Funny that isn't it?

This is a simply matter of the dirty sick imperialists in the US wanting to feed their capitalist monster machine and selfish twisted people like Vienna going along with it as they feel it will further their own gluttonous lives.

Got it in one   Are you people honestly incapable of seeing the threat Iran poses? Or do you just choose to ignore it? It seems like whenever someone raises a point about Iran people counter with "But Israel has nukes!"

No, you're a suicide bomber trainer because you have voiced your support for suicide bombings numerous times in the past and have made clear that your primary allegiance is to Iran while flaming anyone who dared to say anything bad about Iran, including your Respect friends.

From the point of view of those living in the west, Iran is a danger to us, and a nuclear Iran is a nuclear danger.

No - its about us not wanting a nuclear bomb to go off some day in down town London or NY.

I repeat though - since part of your argument is - If the US has them why cant Iran? - would you favour every country in the world having nuclear weapons?

Funny because I live in the west and I see Iran as no threat. And I'm guessing that the overwhelming majority of Europeans agree with me.

Iran is an independent sovereign nation. The USA has no right to humiliate it and has broken no rules. Do you not understand that Iran wants to be able to function as a state after oil runs out?

 
No - its about us not wanting a nuclear bomb to go off some day in down town London or NY.

I would like no country to have nuclear weapons. But if Iran gaining them prevents a war, the possible death of relatives etc then I'd rather they had them.

And about 10 countries have nuclear weapons but only ONE has used them. The same country that has been involved in a war every yea for the last 50 years and has spent more than the combined about of 23 billion dollars every day since the birth of Jesus Christ on weapons.

PREVENT war??? Are you nuts? Iran pursuing nuclear weapons makes war far more likely.

Still you havent answered the question. If part of your reasoning is that since some countries have a nuclear weapon Iran should too, that would mean that ALL countries should have one or be allowed one.

An Iran with Nuclear power? I'm sure they have no problem. I'm sure they would answer no if asked about Iran being a threat.

Iran having a nuclear weapon will rule out any external attack. And Iran isn't gonna attack anyone.

I don't think any countries should have them but I don't want to see another country bombed to hell the US of A.

If Belgium had been accused of having 40 000 suicide bombers at the ready then maybe.

 
Israel isn't a regime. That's a significant reason why Israel having nuclear weapons isn't anything like Iran having them.
 

Israel frequently attacks Lebanon and is currently illegally occupying Palestine. Can't say the same about Iran so I'll agree with you there!

And the US is supposed to take that on faith from a regime that supports terrorist bombings, and chants and calls for the death of the US and for Israel to be wiped from the map?

Not to mention the fact that its highly questionable whether some form of conflict is avoidable BEFORE they are developed. I wouldnt be suprised if Israel took action before they can be put in place.

Starting up nuclear tensions in the region makes conflict MORE not LESS likely.

Yeah, even if Iran was powerful enough, it wouldn't try and take over Israel.
 
 
That doesn't make any sense, moron. Israel isn't a regime, it's a democracy. Iran is run by a theocratic council who decide who can or cannot run for certain posts. That makes it a regime.

So is it only suicide bombings on British troops you support? I'm pretty sure that still makes you a traitor.

The rest of us aren't going to risk a theocratic regime who keeps threatening to destroy Israel having nuclear weapons. You can if you want, personally I cannot wait for the US to go in to action and lay waste to the Iranian nuclear program.
 
 
 
No. An Iran with nuclear weapons. Even the US doesnt care much if IRan has nuclear power... the point is that very few people believe that is what they are ACTUALLY up to.
 

You obviously do not talk to normal people. After Iraq, hardly anyone believes Iran wants nuclear weapons.

 
Not to mention the fact that its highly questionable whether some form of conflict is avoidable BEFORE they are developed. I wouldnt be suprised if Israel took action before they can be put in place.
 

Then it would be illegal action.

 
So is it only suicide bombings on British troops you support? I'm pretty sure that still makes you a traitor.
 

I was already a traitor. I believe in the overthrow of all states to be replaced with workers councils which decided on things. I agree with the abolition of private property and the free movement of Labour. Traitor and proud. I am not inherently loyal to a man made country simply because I happened to be born here. It's like being prouf of your eyelids.
 
 
Let me ask you a simple set of questions:

a) If Iran had a number of nuclear bombs, and the ability to produce nuclear material, is there a chance that it might allow some of that material to find its way into the hands of Hammas or some such group?

b) If Hammas were to get a hold of such material do you think that it woul dbe likely to use it on Israeli civilians?

I hope you also cannot wat for the suicide bombs on the streets of London. I hope you cannot wait to see limbs and blood on the streets of Tehran and New York. I hope that will satisfy your insatiable lust for death.

Lawz - Sure, Iran is going to transport a nuclear warhead to the elected government of Palestine who will then somehow tie it to someone and trigger it.

1. No, because Iran isn;t stupid enough to give nuclear material to a militia group.

2. No, because Hamas are not stupid enough to use nuclear material which would kill Palestinians too.

How does wanting Iran stopped in its tracks equate to wanting the response? I dread the response, but I also will not accept that a nuclear-equipped Iran is anything but a recipe for total catastrophe. I get the feeling that whilst I want Iran to be stopped anyway possible, you're actually looking forward to the response.

What makes you sure they would show such restraint considering Hammas and Iran both want to see Israel "wiped off the map"?

You're also a self-confessed traitor who supports attacks on the armed forces of this country. By rights you should be in prison.

I do not support attacks on anyone. I want our troops brought out of Iraq so none of them have to die.

Iran has no desire to extend its borders.

Obviously it's best to get behind our troops, as they are fighting in our interests, but I actually think he has a valid point here.

Why should you condemn people defending their home land?

Every difference. Then the army are not occupiers - they are invited.

I dont have a right to "defend my homeland" the UK against US military bases in Hampshire by going there and killing people.

They don't appear to have carpet bombed or murdered anywhere in Britain though.

No one invited them to invade Iraq.

That's not a suitable answer.

1) I never mentioned borders. I said "influence". America influences countries outside of its borders because it has power, for example, in terms of values. Surely it is in the best interests of workers to be more influenced by the socially liberal values of the west than the way Iran does things?

2) You make no attempt to tackle the jingoism of the Iranian government. All that wiping Israel off the map, giving the west a bloody nose, starting a Jihad, etc. I have specificlly in mind. That certainly is not in the best interests of the workers of the world.

3) I think your facts are wrong. Persia was ravaging parts of India as late as the end of the 18th century. After then, it was severely weakened and cornered due to more powerful European states (Those effects linger on today. Nuclear weapons would no doubt change that situation.)

The working class had their chance to take the road to a utopian workers paradise (like North Korea) but thought better of it and decided to become middle class and take their holidays in Florida instead.

Rubbish. Your understanding of the British left is piss poor despite your claims to be an ex CPB member.

The SWP has adapted fine. We recognise that the working class looks different now. But if you're working in a car plant or mcdonalds you're still being ****ed over by the ruling class.

The average workers wage in the UK is 13 k pa. That's not a middle class wage.

We had the biggest strike in 80 years a few weeks ago. We've had the AUT/NATFHE strike and the action short of strike they are engaging in now. We've had firefighters strike and tubes strike as well as the strikes in Northern Ireland which won their battle. That's not to mention what's going on in Latin America, Iran, France and South Korea.

And please do not compare me to Billg Bragg!

"I was a miner, I was a railwayman, I was a docker between the wars"

The average worker's (I assume by worker you mean a member of the working class) wage may be $13k but you may have noticed the working class has shrunk rather a lot as its members have left the working class club and joined the middle class club instead) This pattern is called upward social mobility and is possible because of a mechanism we call "wealth creation"...........blah, blah, blah........

Does any of this ring any bells in the sanity department at all or am I wasting my fingerprints?

I'm not sure what you mean by “economic condition”, but I hope Marx would have prefered the workers to live under a society with social mobility, freedom of speech, thought and copulation to one that decried those as immoral, but had less economic inequality (a claim you'd have to justify). I think Islamism would be the perfect example of why the original socialists hated religion; it often justifies rigid and rigidly and rigidly unquestionable social hierarchies.

How can you justify portraying it as a clash with “capitalism”? Surely that makes the implication that Iran is a non-capitalist, or even socialist state relative to western ones? I'd be interested to hear the justification for that claim. I suspect Iran has only even been socialist as long as it justified confiscating the property of rich foreigners.

 
The jingoism of the Iranian government is not going to kill Iranian workers. US bombs will.
 

Just as you were earlier when I responded to you, I'm talking about the "workers of the world". I think they will be slightly worse off if Iran is given the ability to enact its fantasies of annihilating Israel, etc. firstly because it means more people die in wars that wouldn't have happened normally, and secondly because that sort of thing could plunge the world into an economic mess not seen since the 1920's. Anyway, if Iran did try to do those things, you're right, Iranians would probably end up eating American shrapnel, but it would be retaliatory.

 
which website did you just pick that up from?
 

Persian invasions were one of the contributing factors of the demise of the Mughal Empire. I'm not sure how far they went, but I know they got as far as Delhi; which ended in a pretty bloody massacre of the populace. The Mughals were largely superseded by the British. Russia encroached some of Persia's other borders, and over time, Persia was pummeled into insignificance by the Europeans. It's no wonder they haven't done much in the last 200 years (not 400).. they physically couldn't.

The past isn't much of a guide for the future in this case anyway. A more accurate thing would be to use the posturing of the modern regime, or "superpower" as they now describe themselves, as a guideline as to what they might do had they more power. If we do, it certainly doesn't lend your argument much favour.

There is no "old anti-semite card" however much pieces of crap like you try to inist that there is. Once again, we hear the claim that 'Jews play the anti-semite card' 100 times as much as they actually do. You couldn't show me anyone on this forum who has been accused of anti-semitism without very good reason, and indeed the total number of people who have been accused is very small. No serious defender of Israel simply labels every critic of Israel as 'an anti-semite', to claim they do is utterly disingenuous and is another piss-poor propagandist tactic of scum like you.

Never said it had "legal grounds", but then again, it was the EU's definition of anti-semitism and under it you were an anti-semite, were you not? So basically, you agree that I can call you 'an anti-semite (under the EU's definition)' right?

The USA is the only country in the world to have used Nuclear weapons and Israel is the only regime in the middle east to have them. Yet Iran is lambasted for trying to get Nuclear ENERGY. Does it surprise you that Iran wants to be able to keep going as a country after its oil reserves dry up? It's one rule for one country and another for other countries.

It's hypocrisy, it's double standards, it's lies and its an excuse for a war for profit.

 

Of course it's double standards. Only an idiot would treat India and Iran equally on such a matter.

This is a simply matter of the dirty sick imperialists in the US wanting to feed their capitalist monster machine and selfish twisted people like Vienna going along with it as they feel it will further their own gluttonous lives.
 

Your President: After his election he proclaimed, " Thanks to the blood of the martyrs, a new Islamic revolution has arisen and the Islamic revolution of 1384 [the current Iranian year] will, if God wills, cut off the roots of injustice in the world."

Imperialism indeed. Put this defence of the Iranian administration together with your undoubted desire to see a new "Communist international" and your revulsion for imperialism is nothing but "hypocrisy". What are your thoughts on imperialism enforced in the name of Islam and Communism? Unlike the establishment of democracy throughout the Middle East, both would require "A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship".

I've chosen to omit Ahmadinejad's many comments on the annhilation of Israel since such an event is unlikely to be condemned on your part. Feel free to recognise such comments as a direct threat to the sovereign nation of Israel and perhaps then we'll take your preaching as more than the anti-American, anti-Semitic communist bile that it is.

On a seperate point, are you still sharing a platform with those anti-Semitic homophobic terrorist apologisers?

I'm sure many people would, maybe even myself if push came to shove. But that would hardly be a sensible thing to say. Either leader is simply pushing their country's interests as far as possible which is a bit depressing.

In effect, we all lose at some level because of our leaders.

Does any of this ring any bells in the sanity department at all or am I wasting my fingerprints?

 

You do know Kier Hardy was a reformist don't you sweetie?

Millions of people in this country are members of Trade Unions and that's despite the number of unionised workers being at an all time low.

Do you have any figures at all for your mutterings about social mobility? (£64 bn transfered from poor to rich during Thatcher reign)

And in an economic crisis (inherently found within the unstable capitalist economic system) say if the stock market crashes, millions become poorer. But there is no less food in the world, no less materials. In fact there might be too much of these things due to overproduction, again an inherent part of capitalism.

Wealth isn't created, it's distributed. And it's distributed craply at the mo.

 
I'm not sure what you mean by “economic condition”, but I hope Marx would have prefered the workers to live under a society with social mobility, freedom of speech, thought and copulation to one that decried those as immoral, but had less economic inequality (a claim you'd have to justify). I think Islamism would be the perfect example of why the original socialists hated religion; it often justifies rigid and rigidly and rigidly unquestionable social hierarchies.
 

As in having food on the table is more important than universal suffrage. Most people in the world would get richer under socialism.

 
How can you justify portraying it as a clash with “capitalism”? Surely that makes the implication that Iran is a non-capitalist, or even socialist state relative to western ones? I'd be interested to hear the justification for that claim. I suspect Iran has only even been socialist as long as it justified confiscating the property of rich foreigners.
 

That's not what I meant. Iran is a petty bourgeousie country. However the worlds only superpower, the USA needs oil and reconstruction contracts and access to gass supplies etc to ensure it continues to be the worlds only super power. That's what I meant.

 
Just as you were earlier when I responded to you, I'm talking about the "workers of the world". I think they will be slightly worse off if Iran is given the ability to enact its fantasies of annihilating Israel, etc. firstly because it means more people die in wars that wouldn't have happened normally, and secondly because that sort of thing could plunge the world into an economic mess not seen since the 1920's. Anyway, if Iran did try to do those things, you're right, Iranians would probably end up eating American shrapnel, but it would be retaliatory.
 

The Iranian government is not stupid enough to nuke Israel. End of. And an economic crisis would be great because that's when revolutions happen!

 
There is no "old anti-semite card" however much pieces of crap like you try to inist that there is. Once again, we hear the claim that 'Jews play the anti-semite card' 100 times as much as they actually do. You couldn't show me anyone on this forum who has been accused of anti-semitism without very good reason, and indeed the total number of people who have been accused is very small. No serious defender of Israel simply labels every critic of Israel as 'an anti-semite', to claim they do is utterly disingenuous and is another piss-poor propagandist tactic of scum like you.
 

I said zionists were playing it not Jews. I do not believe Vienna is Jewish.

 
Do you prefer worker's rights in China, Iran or the UK?

If you dont choose the latter, please remind us why you live in the UK.
 

The UK. Why mention Iran and China specifically?

Of course I would oppose such expantionist Imperialism. Just like I would never defend the USSR, beacause the analysis of my party believes that it was a state capitalist regime.

Wipe Israel off the map. That could mean a number of things. If it means violently destroying the state of Israel, then I condemn what he said. If it was a grandiose linguistically expressive (like farsi usually is) way of saying they believe in a one state solution, then I agree with him.

Im glad you oppose the Iranian administration's desire to spread Islamic rule. Would you ever be ready to take military action accordingly?

If ive understood you, when the state controls everything its still a capitalist regime. Who do you believe owns all the property if its not private?

And the annihilation of Zionism? Where does that fit into this one state solution? So despite calling for the spread of Islamic rule throughout the globe, Iran would be happy to see a united Palestine with Jews and Judaism living side by side with Palestinians? Or does a one state solution really mean, one state under Allah and death to the Jews who dont convert?

Go to Marxism 2006  http://www.marxism2006.org.uk/  Or go to an SWP Marxist forum on economics. It might be good to hear it from someone better versed than I. And I'm not being silly here, Marxism's a huge event and thought you might be interested in discussing it with some veteran Marxists.

 
Why not? Let me guess, neither China or Iran are socialist?
 

Quite blatantly not.

 
Im glad you oppose the Iranian administration's desire to spread Islamic rule. Would you ever be ready to take military action accordingly?
 

Would I ever agree to some sort of military action by some party to combat the violent spread of Islamic dictatorship? Yes I would.

 
If ive understood you, when the state controls everything its still a capitalist regime. Who do you believe owns all the property if its not private?
 

Not quite. Here's the link to the person who theorised state capitalism, one of the founders of the International Socialists, now the SWP. One of those Jews I'm supposed to despise by the way (like I hate Marx and Trotsky too)  http://www.marxists.org/archive/clif...ecap/index.htm 

 
And the annihilation of Zionism? Where does that fit into this one state solution?

Or does a one state solution really mean, one state under Allah and death to the Jews who dont convert?
 

Though of course the Iranian regime would like to see an Islamic Republic of Palestine, given the fact that Judaism is one of the official religions of Iran and that there are places reserved for Jews in Iran's parliament (way obvove the %age of the population they represent) I doubt they'd force anyone to convert.

 
Yes, wealth, as we all know, just appears out of thin air, ready for distribution.
 

Food can be grown, houses can be built. The resources are there, they just need to be distributed equally.

 
Working class today? Much Bigger or smaller than it was 50 years ago? Anybody? Anybody? Bigger or smaller? Anybody? Anybody? Dust? Anybody Anybody? Dust?
 

Industrial workers? Smaller. Service workers? Bigger.

That's not creating wealth it's converting it.

I think Russia was socialist for a short period.

And there are many socialist aspects to places like Cuba. However, the main problem with most self defined socialist countries is that they did not come about via the self emancipation of the working class which is key.

They became top down rather than socialism from below.

Well I don't agree with that point, but what has socialism got to do with this in the first place if neither of the countries are socialist and both countries are capitalist? I would have thought that if a socialist had to pick the lesser of two evils, he would chose western liberal democracy over what Iran offers. That's assuming a socialist values personal freedoms and the ability for the people to chose how they are ruled. I don't understand your argument. Can you expand upon it a little bit?

I don't think anyone knows what the Iranian government will do, since it's both very secretive and as unpredictable as any insane theocratic revolutionary government can get. We can be certain that they aren't very nice people by our enlightened western standards. We should then be instinctively uneasy of them gaining the power to spread their values and influence (through indirect political influence or directly through military power), and if they have also expressed a desire to carry out acts we find repugnant, we shouldn't assume it's just a bluff and sit idly while they accumulate the means to enact them.

A word of advice, wishing painful catastrophe upon millions of people because you like the sound of being able to incite violent revolution makes you look like a total ass. It makes me question your motivations in the first place. The more and more I think about it the more it becomes plainly obvious that you're an egoist who feeds off other people's suffering.

I'm glad you've ditched the "peaceful Persia" idea.

I think this is more of a myth than a reality. I don't suppose the average Tehranian is any braver in the face of death than the average New Yorker.

Still, we digress significantly from the issue at hand. And that is one of weighing up the gravity the threat and the risks that attach themselves to our decisions.

Iran doesn't inflict poverty on the world, Iran doesn't slaughter hundreds of thousands of people in foreign wars either.

Socialism only works when it comes from below. Socialism cannot be imposed, it won't work. That's why I'm in the SWP and not some Stalinist party.

Please do not patronise me. I believe in mass peoples movements. Where people liberate themselves and stop the oppression that they suffer now under capitalism. Will the ruling class try and smash us? Yes. So is violence necessary? Yes.

Indeed, because every time policy and law has adapted to fit the reality of the working majority, they take their formal rights and create private capital, just as they spent their time creating and developing capital, albeit dead, in the illegal shadows.

The problem is that the majority of people in developing nations dont have the means to create capital and thus enjoy fruits of capitalism. Instead of opening capital up to all, you want to take it away from the few.

Hernando De Soto - Only twenty-five of the worlds 200+ nations produce capital in sufficient quantity to benefit fully from the division of labour in expanded markets. Only capital provides the means to support specialisation and the production and exchange of assets in a global market. It is capital that is the source of increasing productivity and the therefore the wealth of nations.

And here you are telling us we should stand to benefit from its destruction.
 
 
Isn't America being arrogant when it demands that Iran not produce nuclear weapons? Ditto with Britain. If we truly want to see less of these things we should start by reducing our huge supply of them.
 
 
Out of interest - if the populatons of the US, UK, and most of the developed world are not in favour of a worker's collective and a communist government, and you dont support armed insurrection then how do you propose to realise your rather odd dream?

Well it doesn't help when we flood their markets with our overproduction which leaves their means of production redundant.

If workers had control of the means of production then we could produce what was needed for the people not what was needed for the companies to make profit.

I genuinely suggest you go to Marxism.

You're right. It's a shame there's such an absence of logic from those leaders and their supporters. They should take the first step to reduce their nuclear weapons, which is probaby enough to destroy the earth sixfold or something, then negotations could begin.

Socialism cannot come through parliamentary democracy. That would lead to state capitalism.

It cannot come through coup either as it would lead to the same thing.

It comes through organising in work places and universities, by building broad movements which radicalise people and given them confidence as well as giving us an oppotunity to promote revolutionary ideas. In an economic crisis these skills can be used by the workers to take control themselves.

That's a very simplistic way of putting it.

No joke, go to Marxism it's a huge event with leading Marxists speaking, so you'd be able to hear stuff I don't know about or understand that might help with your understandin of Marxism.

You know on the far left the SWP is lambasted as moving to the right. I'd love you to meet someone from Workers Power, they make me look like a liberal.

In a liberal, pluralistic society like ours there are very few real socialists. Look at the voting figures for socialist parties.

It is clear that your revolution will not happen.

The question of its desirability is of course the second problem.

The free market does a far better job of producing what people want and in the quantities they need it than a Marxist command economy could ever manage.

Why do you think the average Soviet citizen spent 15 hours a week queueing up in the snow waiting for necessities?

The beauty of "oblong" is that it is a short word that describes a long shape. How's that for irony?

The debate focuses on what Iran wants to be, not what it does now, and your peaceful Persia argument has already been refuted. What's more likely to want to do the things you listed, a western liberal democracy, which instinctively values individual freedom, has a population that largely fears death and pain, not just for themselves, but for others, allows political dissent.. or Iran.

 
How is it unpredictable or insane?
 

It's unpredicatable because it's actions cannot be predicted by even the brightest IR and politics experts, never mind students on a debate forum. As for insane, well, I'm no qualified psychologist so don't take my word for it, but the way their government ministers constantly behave suggests some kind of pathology. There's also that issue of believing the last words on philosophy were written over a thousand years ago..

 
How racist! If you think imperialism and burning up the climate is enlightened then I'm sorry for you.
 

Racist? What, so the “Iranian government” is a race of its own now is it? Very well. I'm a big fat dirty racist because I think totalitarian Islamists are quite nasty. Pardon me for valuing free speech and sexual freedom above the supposed literal words of some holy invisible man in the clouds!

 
I believe in mass peoples movements. Where people liberate themselves and stop the oppression that they suffer now under capitalism. Will the ruling class try and smash us? Yes. So is violence necessary? Yes.
 

Whatever. Anyone who wants to see mass poverty just so they can have an excuse to blow stuff up is an ******** by my definition.

You've clearly been missing out. But actually 'oblong' refers to the proportions of the shape, not the length in actual terms. So an oblong is by no means necessarily 'long'. Even if indeed a six letter word can officially be deemed 'short'.

I think its worse than that. Its not that they think they know what they want, but what they NEED. It's paternalism and patronisation writ large.

I tried to rep you for agreeing with me but I'd already sucked up to a mod.  
It's pure ignorance and arrogance for any power to hold such capabilities. WMD's are beyond the realms of having a huge army because one soldier can back out but one missle can't. If any country owns a nuclear weapon (I don't know weapon technology very well, so let's go with WMD) it is saying to the world, "we have the right to annihilate masses of people if we feel the need to.".

The structures of the current parliament, police, army judiciary, everything is to preserve the ruling class. They cannot be taken over and used by the working class.

Workers need to take control of production themselves and set up workers councils. Not elect a castro like figure.

And we do not want a Cuban style 'revolution' where the workers are totally deprived of democracy.

 
The free market does a far better job of producing what people want and in the quantities they need it than a Marxist command economy could ever manage.

Why do you think the average Soviet citizen spent 15 hours a week queueing up in the snow waiting for necessities?
 

USSR wasn't Marxist it was Stalinist. Again, read Tony Cliff on State Capitalism.

 
I love the notion that Socialists are looking out for the little man, and the "people" but that their aims cant be attained by asking the "people" what it is they want.
 

Rubbish. Like Lenin said, it's not the job of communists to fence themselves off from the working class, but to work among them. Lenin criticised ultra left left wing communists for setting ultimatums to the class. Read 'Left wing Communism - An Infantile Disorder.' It's a brilliant book.

 
The debate focuses on what Iran wants to be, not what it does now, and your peaceful Persia argument has already been refuted. What's more likely to want to do the things you listed, a western liberal democracy, which instinctively values individual freedom, has a population that largely fears death and pain, not just for themselves, but for others, allows political dissent.. or Iran.
 

So there's bourgeosie or petty bourgeoisie?

 
It's unpredicatable because it's actions cannot be predicted by even the brightest IR and politics experts, never mind students on a debate forum. As for insane, well, I'm no qualified psychologist so don't take my word for it, but the way their government ministers constantly behave suggests some kind of pathology. There's also that issue of believing the last words on philosophy were written over a thousand years ago..
 

They've never done anything unpredictable. And I believe Dubya says that God told him to invade Iraq so they are like two peas in a pod.

 
Racist? What, so the “Iranian government” is a race of its own now is it? Very well. I'm a big fat dirty racist because I think totalitarian Islamists are quite nasty. Pardon me for valuing free speech and sexual freedom above the supposed literal words of some holy invisible man in the clouds!
 

suggesting only those in the west are enlightened is what u said.

 
Whatever. Anyone who wants to see mass poverty just so they can have an excuse to blow stuff up is an ******** by my definition.
 

I think we pretty much already do see mass poverty.

*******s. The current system is perpetuated by the people. If the majority of people wanted a socialist government they would elect one, which would have the power to do anything, from nationalising the railways to putting Lenin and marx kissing on our national flag.

Either the people WANT your revolution - in which case they can elect a government to put it into effect, or they dont - in which case you would force it upon them.

 
And we do not want a Cuban style 'revolution' where the workers are totally deprived of democracy.
 

So what type of "democracy" are you planning then?

Can I also ask this : WHO THE **** ARE THE "WORKERS"?

Wouldnt a society be best if it looked out for everyone? Not just those making things out of wood?

Also - its interesting that many "workers" in london earn up to 80k a year. I can see them all now - clamoring for a socialist state so that they can buy bread.

The ruling class has different ways of preserving itself. Giving reform or buying off the workers as Marx says, is one of those ways. These reforms are inevtiably attacked though like Clinton's attack on the welfare state.

That's not true. I think you need to read some stuff on reform or revolution. Try Rosa Luxembourg.

People do not want a revolution now. So we do not work like Stalinists to impose one. We work among the vanguard.

$$Everyone would share collective responsibility so everyone would be a worker.

I haven't actually read too much. I have done jobs actually, though as a student not as much as a 40 year old worker, obviously. I am not an expert on all things working class and that's why I urge people to go to Marxism 2006  http://www.marxism2006.org.uk/ 

I also do **** loads of work politically which actually takes up a lot of time. That's why I'm sure the life expectancy of comrades is a good ten years less.

And please can people stop with the racist jibes.

Err.. If western liberal democracy (which instinctively values individual freedom, allows political dissent, etc) equals “bourgeoise”. How can Iran equal a smaller form of “bourgeoisie”, when they stand opposed to these characteristics?

Africa - the ONLY continent to get poorer in recent decades.

Boom and bust is better than bust and buster.

Reforming to give the majority more rights? Thats precisely what we have today, a system that recognises capital, with socialist mechanisms such as a minimum wage and labour rights. Marx opposed a very different type of capitalism, one that was defeated when legislation was drafted that opened up expanding markets and property rights to those that had been otherwise trading and living illegally. Such legislation was the acceptance of what the working class had already implemented extralegally.

That is the problem with capitalism in China and other developing nations, where the law prohibits their access to capital. We need more capitalism, not its destruction.

So that's all the world is to you then? A big black and white, capitalism versus socialism, with no shades of grey or any other issues being important? That's very shallow. Even if I hated "capitalism", I'd rather democratic and liberal influence be stronger and totalitarian Islamism weaker.

Nothing to alter about the fact that people and things will die and be destroyed if America steps its iron boot any closer to Iran.  
 
 
The truth about the world is harsh. Corrupt people gain power and do immoral things. This has always been the case.

We may believe that a true democracy exists, but personally, I don't believe people can ever live like that. Freedom...in a sad way, is an illusion (but now I'm sounding all Orwellian and must stop!).

I do feel saddened by what war causes. I have never seen one myself, only through the TV, reading the news and history books. It's in human nature though, and we just aren't evolved enough to think otherwise.

This wouldn't be anywhere near as a big a deal if we knew Iran was going to create nuclear weapons that would sit in their silos. The fear is that Iran would use them as soon as they obtained them.

 
Iran hasnt threatened to get rid of Israel through use of nuclear weapons - ever! The israeli government isnt any safer or less fanatic!

No, of course they haven't, because then they would never be allowed to obtain them. They would have nothing to gain and everything to lose by admitting they intend to use nukes against Israel. They have however said multiple times that Israel will be destroyed shortly by "one storm", and would love to do it.

Of course they claim they are using the technology to create energy, as long as they say that they can play the victim in whatever conflict occurs.

The Real reason there could be an attack against Iran, is maybe because the Americans are selfish, they want to be the dominent power. It is not okay to let Iran have Nukes because they MIGHT use them, but it is Okay to let an arrogant, nieve Country (America) have them when they have already used them and who said they won't again. Period.

Oh by the way I am not condeming the American People it is the politians who make the desicions they are the ones who are selfish, it is them who at the top of the line of a powerful country are too nieve and arrogant to hand a bit of power or a helping hand to any country. But then again you can';t blame them. They tried to help the people South Vietnam and what do people do, slag them off. The way the world works. If a country is in trouble and you don't help you are at fault and if you do help it you are still at fault. You just can't win. Power to the People my American Friend
 
 
Every country would like to be the most dominant power. Anyhow reality is USA would come closest but in the future China will overtake US. It will be interesting to see how china plays its cards on middle eastern affairs.

The decision to use nuclear weapons against Japan was a lose/lose situation, and has very litttle to do with Iran's current nuclear desires.
 
 
Iran is a unstable country, its leader as stated many times that he doesnt recognize israels sovereignty, And have called for Israels Destruction. I think that the Israelis will do a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, Israel will not accept Iran with nuclear weapons.
 
 
As if China Will. They are commies, lets not forget who owns over 80% of their industry. If America cut Their econonimic tie with China wouldn't lose their industry as they would still have the factories but they would have a total economic collapse. People think to much of China. They only make money cause they treat people like crap, they only make money cause they have alot of people. When the people shift to Democrocy China will have money problems higher than anyone before. A total Econonmic and Industrial Implosion. They have the worst army as well. If Britain Joined America today as the 5?th state we could be sure America would be forever the world most powerful country until the wourld unites. The real Superpower of tommorow is the European Union they are bot hSmaller than America and China but Produce and Take at Least 5times more and have a much larger professional army. If Europe was a Country then you'd be in for it
 
 
Lets not also forget the Iranina leader is an arse. But he does have a good Arguement concerning the Holocaust. It is not okay for the Nazi's to kill Jews and Throw them out of their country Innoncent Jews. But it is okay for them To to the Same to the Palestinians. Hippocracy at it's highest

How can you reason with people who refuse to recognize your existence. You claim its only a few terrorist that is doing all the harm well mabe it's only a few soldiers shooting innocent people. Many Israelis and Jews have been killed in terrorist attacks.
And to that other guy, you are the biggest idiot on the planet!
 
 
Have merged the d and d thread with the one from general chat.
 
 
Hamas have planned and sent out young men, sometimes boys, to kill - and die - for there gains. They have the blood of hundreds of Israeli people on there hands. They teach parents to raise their children as murderers. The Palestinian people have to help to prevent terrorism.

Sorry, how many Jews blew themselves up in cafes full of innocent Germans... Oh yes, none.
It's completely ignorant, disingenuous and downright sick to blame the morally indefensible act of suicide-terrorism on the victims when it was completely the choice of the attackers to do what they did. You're basically quoting the Hamas view on the topic.

They want to dominate the world. Anyone who does not agree is almost certainly a Muslim, who is insecure, paranoid and arrogant, thinking the whole world is against Muslims, like the rest of the world hasn't got a better thing to do.

Iran should be stopped!

Multiple times on this forum you have sought to justify and have condoned the murder of Jewish settlers. You have called them 'scum' and 'a cancer'. Those people are murdered Jewish settlers. Either you are making an exception or are doing some serious backtracking on your previously staked-out positions.

At the least you've said such things as you can understand Palestinians turning to terrorism because of x,y,z, and (iirc) that you would have done the same in their position. That's justifying. I'm not saying you're wrong, only that you justified.

Actually, you're the liar. Are you actually saying that you've never sought to justify palestinian terrorism and have never argued that the "resistance" is legitimate? Because I think you'll find that you have and that anyone who has debated with you will attest that. Furthermore, calling Jewish settlers a 'cancer' is utterly dehumanising and villifying them, so when you then say that you don't justify and condone attacks on them, it sounds incredibly hollow, as it's fairly clear you barely consider them people.

 Definitions of justify on the Web  :

show to be reasonable or provide adequate ground for

apologize: defend, explain, clear away, or make excuses for by reasoning; "rationalize the child's seemingly crazy behavior"; "he rationalized his lack of success"

absolve: let off the hook; "I absolve you from this responsibility"

defend or show adequate grounds for decisions or conclusions.

Person, whenever this discussion (Pali terrorism) comes up you justify by citing x, y, and z Israeli "crime". You do not say - "there is no excuse for this behaviour and I condemn it."
 
 
You should chose your words better in future Person. You obviously want something done about this "cancer" and we all know that cancer cannot be dealt with through diplomacy, but through bloody surgery and radiation blasts. Which is what many people in the Muslim world want, most likely including the specific Islamist who you were defending. Jonathan's conclusion that you also want slaughter is a fair and logical one.
