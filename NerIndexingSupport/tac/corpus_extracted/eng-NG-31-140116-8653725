Thanks for the thoughts. I worry about the Bolts though. There's a
pattern of good teams struggling for a few games after they play the
Pats and lose in a demoralizing fashion. Hope this doesn't happen to
your team. And you and most of the SD fans who've posted in the Pats NG
have been great, classy fans. In a way, you represent your team better
than some of your start players. Hope to see you guys again in the playoffs.

Look on the bright side...you'd beat us 9 times if we played 10
games.....according to LT anyway....so that means you'll win the next
18 matches!

I second your post. At least on usenet, SD fans are pretty classy.

I still think SD makes the playoffs. Denver has beaten two pretty poor teams
by a total of four points and on last second kicks to boot. KC has major
issues on both sides of the ball. The Raiders don't have a ton of talent,
but damn, they are showing some heart this year. It'll come down to Denver
or San Diego. Denver is the worst 2-0 team without a doubt.

Havn't seen all the posts today but that is the 3rd one I've read from a
Bolts fan that was 100% classy. Too bad more opposing fans weren't like
that (and that includes any of us that go into other team newsgroups)

We weren't that classy last year, but last year was different. Our
team controlled most of that game and still lost. Then a few of your
players danced on our logo doing Merriman's dance.

This year, your team dominated, completely deserved to win and your
players handled their domination like good sportsmen. We've got
nothing to complain about regarding your players. We do have
something
to complain about regarding ours (their play, not their
sportsmanship).

Good luck the rest of the season. Last year your best receiver was
Reach Caldwell - the guys your management picked up in the offseason
(Moss, Welker, Stallworth) are all better than him. Your team looks
pretty awesome - Bellichick and Pioli did an incredible job. Your
team
got better, ours didn't. oh well. Cheers.
