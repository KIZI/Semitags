President Barack Obama is wrapping up his vacation on Martha's Vineyard and heading for New Orleans to mark the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.

The president and his family boarded a Marine helicopter Sunday, the first leg of a trip that will take them to the Crescent City.

The 10-day vacation was filled with golf outings, visits to the beach, dinners out and plenty of downtime. Heavy rain washed out four days of the holiday soon after the Obamas arrived, but when the weather cleared it was perfect for their second straight August at a rented private farm compound.
