Italian rider Francesco De Bonis has become the first cyclist to be sanctioned
for doping on the basis of irregular readings on his biological passport, world
cycling's governing body International Cycling Union (UCI) said on Thursday.

De Bonis has been banned for two years and fined 13,000 euros, said the UCI in a
statement.

"The UCI emphasises the historic importance of this first judgement under the
scope of the biological passport programme, introduced by the UCI in 2008," it
said.

Explaining the significance of the case, a UCI spokesman said that De Bonis has
never tested positive in anti-doping tests, but that he had been caught and
judged as his blood profile in his biological passport showed irregular
readings.

At the same time, the UCI also announced that Spanish rider Antonio Colom Mas,
has also been suspended for two years and fined 46,958 euros for doping.
