Detroit News staff

Last-minute shoppers have always relied on that perennial
holiday favorite, the book, to complete their gift list. If you're
still flailing around for ideas, look no further than your favorite
bookseller for one of these recent releases suggested by our crew
of ink-stained elves.

Becoming Jimi Hendrix, Steven Roby & Brad Schreiber (Da Capo,
$12.21).

This book focuses tightly on Jimi Hendrix's early days,
including his poverty-stricken Seattle childhood, unsuccessful Army
stint and rough life as an itinerant R&B sideman. He is one of the
most admired electric guitarists in the world, but as a young
player was kicked out of Hank Ballard & the Midnighters' tour bus
because he "couldn't play the music right." He was lazy, dreamy,
talked rather like the cartoon character Snagglepuss and seemed
destined for nothing much. How that distracted, guitar-crazy boy
evolved into Jimi Hendrix is quite a story.

Susan Whitall

First Step 2 Forever: My Story , Justin Bieber (Harper Collins/
$21.99).

OMG BIEBER! OK, in terms of Big Important Autobiographies,
history probably won't remember it as being as essential as "The
Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin." But then Franklin's hair
wasn't quite as dreamy as the Biebz, so there. "First Step 2
Forever" has everything a Bieber fan could want: pictures of
Biebz, tweets from Biebz and deep thoughts from Biebz ("I was
devastated," he says, of hearing of Michael Jackson's death. Aww,
Biebz!). Get this now, so you're all caught up by the time the
sequel comes out, which at this pace will probably be next summer.

Adam Graham

Crochet Master Class: Lessons and Projects from Today's Top
Crocheters, Jean Leinhauser and Rita Weiss (Potter Craft/$22.99).

If you know a crafter who'd like to learn about various forms of
crochet, this book will definitely satisfy their curiosity with
interesting information on 18 different methods. It offers how-to
techniques from masters such as Carol Ventura, who does tapestry
crochet; Jane Snedden Peever, known for her Aran crochet; Hartmutt
Hass, a filet crocheter; Nancy Wiseman, who works with wire; and
Prudence Mapstone, a free-form crochet artist.

Jocelynn Brown

The Looney Tunes Treasury, Andrew Farago (Running Press, $45).

"Treasury" is the keyword here, as the latest volume in
Running Press' series is packed with trivia and goodies. Not only
do you get an exhaustive history of beloved characters including
Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, there's also page after page
of vibrant art and a bunch of memorabilia. Find reproductions of
vintage comic books, masks, scripts, stickers, Pepe Le Pew
Valentine's Day cards and more. It's a must-have tome for anyone
looney for "Looney Tunes."

Eric Henrickson

Michigan's Destination Depots: Lighthouses Along the Rivers of
Steel, Ronald Campbell & Jacqueline Hoist ($15).

From two Flint architects who built careers renovating historic
buildings comes this excellent tribute to 22 Michigan train depots
still in top-top shape, whether active Amtrak stations like Niles
(1891), or retrofitted into a restaurant like Birmingham's gorgeous
1931 Grand Trunk station. Handsome recent photos are nicely paired
with historic images and maps. And who knew that Chelsea's first
station was destroyed when vandals "cabled the depot to the back
of a departing train?" Privately printed, the book is only
available in the metro area at the Rochester Hills Museum at Van
Hoosen Farm. Call (248) 656-4663 and ask for the gift shop.

Michael H. Hodges

Life , Keith Richards, with James Fox (Little, Brown, $39.99).

You already know about Keith Richards' sexual taunts aimed at
his Rolling Stones partner Mick Jagger, his (formerly) prodigious
drug intake and crush on Ronnie Spector, so we can dispense with
that. This hefty memoir is really a treasure because of Keith's
thoughts about music, what inspired him, and how he came to produce
some of rock's most enduring riffs.

SW

The Playboy Cover to Cover Hard Drive (Bondi Digital Publishing/
$299.95).

This handy, iPod-sized hard drive contains PDF Editions of every
issue of Playboy from 1953 to 2010. That's more than 650 issues and
100,000 pages, complete with the original ads (old cigarette ads
are crazy!). It also comes with an easy-to-use searchable database,
so you can filter through any article in the magazine's history.
And let's face it, everyone reads Playboy for the articles.

AG

Fresh Quilting: Fearless Color, Design and Inspiration, Malka
Dubrawsky (Interweave/$26.95).

prints and shapes. From simple round coasters to a patchwork coin
purse, she takes readers step-by-step through colorful techniques
for creating a number of practical items. Inspiring color
photographs of each finished project will have crafters searching
through their stash fabric to piece together a quilted work of art.

Decoded, Jay-Z (Spiegel & Grau, $35).

Jay-Z traces his ascension from Brooklyn hustler to the world's
biggest rapper in this richly detailed book, which breaks down the
origins of some of his best-known rhymes. In the past several
years, Jay-Z has elevated his stature and become one of the
greatest ambassadors for hip-hop culture; now 41, he's aging quite
gracefully, which has been a struggle for many hip-hop artists. A
deeply personal look at this process, "Decoded" is the latest
step in Jay-Z's road to hip-hop immortality.

AG

Frank: The Voice - The Story of an American Phenomenon, James
Kaplan (Doubleday, $35).

There's little we don't already know about Frank Sinatra's
complicated, colorful life, but Kaplan re-calibrates the narrative
in a novelistic style that the dyed-in-the-wool Sinatra fan will
enjoy.

SW

The Glass Rainbow, James Lee Burke (Simon & Schuster).

Few mystery writers have Burke's combination of gifts; a poet's
mastery of the language, epic pacing and a passionate advocacy for
the natural world and life's underdogs. The return of his flawed
but honorable character, the Cajun Vietnam vet Dave Robicheaux, is
bittersweet, as it may be our last view of him.

SW

Craig Yoe (IDW Publishing, $34.99).

nativity story and more Santas and elves than you can shake a candy
cane at.

EH
