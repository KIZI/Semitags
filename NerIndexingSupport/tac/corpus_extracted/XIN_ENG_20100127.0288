Brazil's Industry Confidence Index (ICI) rose to 68.7 points in January, hitting
its highest level in 11 years, said a study by the National Industry
Confederation (CNI) on Tuesday.

The confidence index in January went up 2.8 points from the latest quarterly
reading in October, and was 21.3 points higher than the same period last year,
according to the CNI.

The figure reflected that the Brazilian industrialists have become more
optimistic about the country's economic situation in the next six months, the
CNI study said.

It also showed that the economic crisis seemed to have come to an end and the
Brazilian economy was slowly returning to its normal levels, said CNI's research
chief, Renato da Fonseca.

The CNI study, carried out from Jan. 4 to 22, was based upon a survey of 1,431
Brazilian companies.

Meanwhile, the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV) said Tuesday that the country's
consumer confidence index rose to 113 points in January, up 0.6 percent from
December.
