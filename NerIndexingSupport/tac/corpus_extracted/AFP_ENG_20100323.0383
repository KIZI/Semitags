Indian-owned steelmaker Corus has won a 200-million-pound contract to supply
French energy giant Total with pipes for a new gas field project in Scotland,
the British government announced on Tuesday.

The contract, worth the equivalent of 222 million euros or 300 million dollars,
will be handled by the Corus pipe mill in Hartlepool, northeastern England,
supporting more than 350 jobs.

"The Business Secretary Lord (Peter) Mandelson welcomed news today that the
Corus pipe mill at Hartlepool has signed a letter of award for a contract worth
almost 200 million pounds as part of Total's new gas field project in Scotland,"
the government said in a statement.

"Corus will be supplying pipes to Total and its partner Dong Energy who are
investing 2.5 billion pounds in developing the Laggan and Tormore offshore gas
fields in the region west of Shetland."

The contract will safeguard or create the jobs in northeastern England over the
next two years, added the statement from Mandelson's Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills (BIS).

The Corus workers will produce 520 kilometres of pipes -- which is equivalent to
the distance from Edinburgh to London in a straight line.

"This is excellent news for the Corus workforce at Hartlepool," added Mandelson.
The major contract was signed at the BIS headquarters in central London on
Tuesday.

He added: "The gas field project was given the green light last week following
the introduction of a tax relief allowance by the Treasury.

"The gas fields will produce more than 1 trillion cubic feet of gas in the
course of the field's life."

Corus is owned by India's Tata Steel, which is the eighth-biggest steelmaker in
the world.

Tata Steel, part of the sprawling Tata Group conglomerate, bought Anglo-Dutch
company Corus for 13.7 billion dollars in 2007.

Corus, which produces about 20 million tonnes of steel a year, accounts for more
than two-thirds of Tata Steel's production.
