The Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS) will each hold meetings in Seoul immediately preceding the
G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Gyeongju, the G20
Summit organizers said Thursday.

The BCBS meeting is scheduled for Oct. 19, one day ahead of the FSB Plenary
meeting slated for Oct. 20, the Presidential Committee for the G20 Summit said
in a press release.

Approximately 130 senior government officials from financial regulatory
authorities and financial sector experts from international organizations will
gather in southern Seoul for the two meetings.

The two meetings are to cover the new bank capital and liquidity regulation
framework and policy recommendations for the systemically important financial
institution (SIFI) reform.

The conclusions of the two meetings will be reported to the Gyeongju meeting and
ultimately to the Seoul G20 Summit in November, according to the organizing
committee.

"The FSB Plenary meeting and BCBS meeting in Seoul are of great significance in
successfully hosting the G20 Seoul summit through coordination on regulatory
reform task assigned by G20 heads," Ernst Lee, South Korea's Financial Services
Commission ( FSC) spokesperson, said, vowing to host the meetings successfully.

The FSB Plenary meeting is the first of its kind to be held in emerging markets
since the inception of the FSF, predecessor of the FSB, in 1999, according to
the FSC.
