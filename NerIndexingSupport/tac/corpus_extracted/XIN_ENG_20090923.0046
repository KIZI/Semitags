Vietnam and Kuwait agreed that the two countries would elevate the energy
cooperation into a new height, the local newspaper Vietnam Economic Times
reported Wednesday.

The agreement was made at the talks here between Vietnamese Minister of Ministry
of Industry and Trade Vu Huy Hoang and Kuwaiti Minister of Oil and Information
Ahmad Al-Abdulla Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.

In coming years, Vietnam will have a growing demand in energy consumption,
especially electricity, oil and gas, said trade minister Vu Huy Hoang.

The Vietnamese trade minister expected the two countries to intensify
cooperation in probing, exploitation oil streams unearthed in the two countries
or in the third country.

Vietnam would offer favorable conditions for Kuwaiti businesses coming to
Vietnam for cooperation in oil exploitation and refinery.

The Kuwaiti Minister of Oil and Information said that Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation (KPC) and Vietnam Oil and Gas Company, Petrovietnam, would soon join
hands to set up joint ventures of oil exploitation and refinery.

To realize the cooperation, the two sides agreed to establish a joint committee
on Vietnam-Kuwait trade and economic cooperation scheduled to convene its first
meeting in December.

The two-way trade between Vietnam and Kuwait in 2008 saw a year- on-year
increase of 78 percent to 117 million U.S. dollars, according to Vietnam's
Ministry of Industry and Trade.
