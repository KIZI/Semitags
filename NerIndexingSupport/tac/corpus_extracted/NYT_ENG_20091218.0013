DETROIT  The Lightning better be careful.

That was the message from players after a disheartening 3-0 loss
to the Red Wings on Thursday night at Joe Louis Arena.

"We are in the danger zone," right wing Marty St. Louis said.

Said defenseman Mattias Ohlund: "We're running out of time to
start winning these games."

It is not as if Tampa Bay (11-14-9) is out of the playoff race.
It is two points from the final spot in the East. The frustration
comes from the way a 1-8-2 streak has played out.

"It's beyond embarrassing," goaltender Mike Smith said. "We
have to stop this.  If we keep making the same mistakes that we've
made for it seems like forever, we don't stand a chance.

"We don't have a good enough team to make all these mistakes
and win."

The biggest mistake: the inability to score. That came into
focus when former Lightning forward Drew Miller scored the winner
8:24 into the first period on a dramatic play in which he created
his own breakaway by plucking a puck out of the air with his stick
and potting a backhander while leaping over Smith.

"A nice play," Tocchet said. "But those types of plays, when
you're scoring, you can withstand."

Instead, the Lightning was shut out for the second time in three
games and the fourth time in 10. Only twice in the 11-game slide
has it scored more than twice.

Give credit to Red Wings goalie Jimmy Howard, who made 30 saves
for his first career shutout. But Tampa Bay, with a 30-22 shot
advantage, couldn't take advantage of prime chances.

It went 0-for-5 on the power play. Steven Stamkos hit a post.
And Stephane Veilleux was stoned by Howard from in close with 40
seconds left in the second period and the score 1-0.

It didn't help that St. Louis had zero shots and Vinny
Lecavalier one.

"I'm sure guys are trying, but you'd like to bang a couple
home," Tocchet said. "It's not one or two guys. We've got to get
something from the (defense), get a shot through. We have to get
somebody in front. We need someone to have a huge night for us."

The Lightning also could do without plays such as the one that
led to Todd Bertuzzi's goal 6:48 into the third period that made it
2-0. Lightning defenseman Lukas Krajicek couldn't clear the
defensive zone. Kurtis Foster took himself out of the play by going
spread eagle, and Blair Jones was a step behind Bertuzzi's drive to
the net.

"We all have to step up," St. Louis said. "Not one man is
going to beat a team in this league. We need everybody."

"If we don't start doing it, it's going to be a long year,"
Smith said. "It already has been."
