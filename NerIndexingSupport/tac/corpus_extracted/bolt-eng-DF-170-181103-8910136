I found these photos revealing, in that other countries children are be trained and driven, long before ours get off the bottle. What the hell have the conservatives done to America with their dumb down corporations of capitalism?? Think about this when the toys come crawling out from under the Christmas tree in the name of Christ and all that BS. Buy your kid weight set and start giving his Lil ass some discipline, get him in martial arts, etc.

The Perm police school is an educational institution that trains and educates future Russian policemen. It is the first and every important step for young boys and girls in becoming police officers.
 

How children as young as four are stretched in training to be China's future gymnasts

And by what standards are you comparing anything?

Our children don't have to learn war immediately. I think that's a blessing. They will learn it soon enough.

Though training the kids isn't a completely bad idea. But my guess is you want the government to oversea it.
 
 
Hey! We buy our kids video games so that they can learn how to blow up wedding parties with drones!
 
 
Neoliberalism does not believe in the public sector. It is building a dystopia of disconnected private enclaves.

There is no America left to defend. Eventually the wealthy will live in walled neighborhoods with private security. Blackwater is the future.

We do not see children as a collective -- a national asset! -- warranting investment. We used to invest in the middle class. We used to invest in public education, so our children had a context for growth.

That's all socialism now. Children are left to the fickle temperament of the market.

.....abandoned to McDonald's and World of Warcraft, wherever profit can burrow its way into their soul and feed on their flesh, making them stupid consumers.

In China they build gymnasts and scientists. In America they build consumers who go into crippling debt buying shiny plastic objects.

Who convinces them that they need the shiny plastic object?

The market.

Freedom! Ain't it grand.

(passt: the government won WWII, took us to the moon, and invented the computer. This is when we used to see children as an asset to invest in. Each child was seen as a piece of glorious potential - perhaps the next Einstein or inventor of post-oil energy. Poverty was seen as destroying that potential. So we did something about it - we taxed the fortunate at a higher rate so more poor children could become educated and lead productive lives*. That's over now. Reagan convinced us that those children were just welfare queens. So we stopped investing in them, hoping the market would magically save them. Who knew the market would just sell them sugar and make them fat. "Freedom"! It's working out well for us.)

* Ronald Reagan's father was saved by a New Deal work program, which was paid for by progressive taxation. America invested in Ronald Reagan. It wasn't a handout. We didn't call Reagan a welfare queen so we could justify letting him rot. We used to treat children as valuable assets. That's all socialism now.
 
 
Are you smoking something?
 
 
As attractive a concept it may seem, these 'acadamies' in Russia are hangovers from the cold war that feed propaganda and rhetoric into an impressionable mind that should be focused on playing and exploring basic social skills; not being drilled and intimidated by possibly damaged or unstable adults. And the gymnastics schools you've noted are few and far between in China. Only a select few are accepted into what can turn-out to be a life-long commitment.

I'll grant you, evidence suggests that America and the western world is voluntarily sliding into the jaws of consumerism at an alarming rate, and that this trend should be curbed; but why must the government take responsibility and provide bootcamps for lazy and disinterested youth. No, the owness is on the parents. There's nothing wrong with allowing a son or daughter to spend time chatting online or playing computer games, but it should be regulated by their parents and their parents are morally and duty bound to provide an alternative. For example, and forgive the stereotype, what about taking their son camping. I remember my father teaching me to shoot, skin and cook a rabbit when I was a child, why not pass-on that valuable skill? Basically, if the parent can be bothered, the opportunities are boundless. But if all they want to do is drink a six-pack when they get home from work, then what kind of message is that passing-on to their children?

If you want an ideal miltary model children can take part in, then look no further than the British Army's Cadets programme. It's part funded by the British military, is run by former Army personnel, is entirely voluntary and once the cadets have crossed over onto the cadet base, they're immediately and officially under British military law. In return for subjecting themselves to what can be harsh military discipline, they're given the opportunity to take-part in live firing exercises (remember, firearms aren't nearly as available in the UK as they are in the US), travel all over the UK and make some great friends. The added bonus is that they get to go home at the end of the day.

 
 
 
I took Karate classes at about the age of those chillin' in the picture... And they gymnastics/sports machine cult in the U.S. is not terribly different from abroad.

I don't think the divide is as great as you make it seem.

I agree. I, too, can cherry pick some photos of American Children engaging in athletics, martial arts and such at an early age.

I was a gymnast at the age of 4....and able to perform giants on the H-bar at the age of 6. My first still iron cross on the rings...held for 5 seconds....was at the age of 9.

My wife was deemed an olympic hopeful at figure skating at the age of 13.

We have hundreds...thousands....of collegiate athletes that compete and match up to, and frequently outperform the world in every sport.

And the differecne? Most of them do it by choice...or, at the very least, by choice of their parents. (That is another debate for another day).

And I wont even get into the superiority of our military personnel...again, all in the military by choice.
 
 
 
I found these photos revealing, in that other countries children are be trained and driven, long before ours get off the bottle. What the hell have the conservatives done to America with their dumb down corporations of capitalism?? Think about this when the toys come crawling out from under the christmas tree in the name of christ and all that BS. Buy your kid weight set and start giving his lil ass some disipline, get him in martial arts, etc.

The Perm police school is an educational institution that trains and educates future Russian policemen. It is the first and every important step for young boys and girls in becoming police officers.

 

Hmml lets see here.
Competition has been declared bad for children's fragile ego by the Left, thus banned in most schools.
Contact sports have been deemed too dangerous and too prone to lawsuits by the Left, thus banned in most schools.
Patriotism has been deemed bad by the Left so banned in most places.
The Boy Scouts have been deemed bad by the Left, so constantly facing persecution.

How has any of this been the fault of conservatives, who are all in favor of competitions and training for kids??

What makes the U. S. unique is (or, was ) our creativity. The idea that children need to be driven....before they're given the opportunity to play, and let their imagination run-wild....is counter-productive; anti- American. The idea that children or (worse, yet ), adults plan a variable- free course-of-action to determine a child's future/occupation is a direct-result of laziness ; conservatism. Orwellian would be another apt-description. How many people are there, to-date, who're absolutely- miserable, because they'd pursued a career that'd please their parents??

As-far-as conservatives/corporations go.....my best point-of-reference is my Generation; the Boomers. Too -many people suggest we were/are "too materialistic". When it comes to the Yuppie-faction (unfortunately, the majority), I can't disagree. My point is....our Generation was BRED TO CON $ UME !!!! When  Madi$on Avenue figured-out  they could (actually) come into-our-homes (with this new T.V.-invention; especially during the '50s) and $ ell to us, it was GAME ON !!!!

Several-years-ago, I was a designer in the playground-equipment industry. Priority 1, in that business (nowdays) is SAFETY!!! You ever see any merry-go-rounds, in playgrounds, anymore ??? Probably not. ALL merry-go-rounds are (now) subject to speed-controll !!!! Their diameter determines what speed is allowed! Beyond a 5-foot diameter, they're required to have some-kind-of speed-limiter.  

"We" have homogenized playground-equipment to the degree, where....it's no wonder children (now) get their adrenaline- fix from video-games !!!!

When we Boomers were kids, bumps/bruises/broken-bones/stitches were a fact-of-Life. I don't remember anyone who'd faced a debilitating/life-threatening condition, because the didn't wear a bicycle-helmet....but, I do see the value in wearing one....if a parent chooses-so. Also, we Boomers only had 3 major-networks (on T.V.), for our viewing-pleasure.

What kids NEED is the opportunity to be creative....without the creativity being done, FOR them. Imagination/creativity doesn't seem to be encouraged, much, anymore. Is it any wonder this Country hasn't moved (much) beyond the latest cell-phone enhancements?

We probably are. The military revealed that some huge number of potential recruits are ineligble because of physical condition.
But you're right, blaming conservatives is partisan crap.

Dude... I'm 28. I was in high school 10 years ago.

We played football, and dodge ball, we were taught wrestling, track, and just about every other competitive sport there is.

A friend of mine is now a football coach at my high school, so I guess they're still doing sports. There's just no evidence for the accusations. I find them, in fact, laughable.

Oh...dont get me wrong. I realize Rabbi exaggerrated the point hew was making. My sone played football and lacrosse and was recrutied by over 100 schools at the collegiate level. But there is no denying that there is more and more intervention by left organizations as it pertains to "issues" in competition. Not enough to eliminate it....but it is certainly not the right that complains about competitive issues.

But that being said, if Shintao is correct with his premise...exactly how would it be the fault of the right as he so clearly states?

I disagreed with Shintao. However, as a country we perhaps are falling behind physically with regard to the average Joe. That comes with the complacency of plenty. But to suggest our athletes are somehow second rate compared to others'? That's just silly. We grind out some of the most elite athletic machines in the world.

Sometimes. But I see plenty of right wing fringe weenies in my neck of the woods that may want to continue ROTC and militarty recruiting but never served, would not serve, did everything they could to avoid serving and would not want their kids to serve.
But I agree with you on the rest of your post. However, many object to the recruiting tactics. Big $$, many promises and a fun tour of the military. Both of my sons are being recruited now as college grads. I support their decision and leave it to them but I also inform them. Get the contract and have a lawyer tell them what it is. No cry babies.

Same here. I played a lot of years and my son played big time high school ball here. Amazing the athletes we have. And the process we have to develop them is so much better than most other countries. Sports for a long time in my life was my strength and now it is my weakness!!
 
 
My goodness what a confused complaint.

America ought to train our children like they did in SPARTA?!

And liberals are responsible for us not being like that?

Has it occurred to any of dunderheads that SPARTA was a socialist FASCIST STATE?

No of course not.

To put all that together requires some understanding of the subjects you opine upon.

My son was recruited to play for one of the academies...either football or lacrosse...both coaches wanted him, but he was only allowed to commit to one sport. We went through the process including Senator recommendations, meeting with multiple Lt. Col's, official visit...and in the end he opted not to attend/play for them; and instead commited to a private institution. I was disappointed in his decision but never let him know. His choice was based on commitment. He was not convinced he wanted a long term military career and I understood. As for my wife? She struggled with it as well. She has attended too many funerals.
I decided it best that I take a back seat in regard to his decision.
I am equally proud of him however as he is developing into a fine young man.

Arguing that you played sports in high school 10 years ago so there is no problem with physical education is like saying my wife and I both have jobs so there is no problem with unemployment.
Reality is beyond your own experiences.

In fact we do have a problem. And the cause is largely from the Left.

My county is 100% Republican and the state is 100% control of Republicans.
They have cut the spending in schools and sports across the board.
This is not a political problem, it is a national problem.
Most importantly it is a PARENT PROBLEM and the parents are overwhelmingly Republican in the south.
 
 
We should be more concerned about our economic future vs China's, and not a few pictures of kids that you can find in any country.
 
 
 
 
 
Same here. I played a lot of years and my son played big time high school ball here. Amazing the athletes we have. And the process we have to develop them is so much better than most other countries. Sports for a long time in my life was my strength and now it is my weakness!!

 

My son was recruited to play for one of the academies...either football or lacrosse...both coaches wanted him, but he was only allowed to commit to one sport. We went through the process including Senator recommendations, meeting with multiple Lt. Col's, official visit...and in the end he opted not to attend/play for them; and instead commited to a private institution. I was disappointed in his decision but never let him know. His choice was based on commitment. He was not convinced he wanted a long term military career and I understood. As for my wife? She struggled with it as well. She has attended too many funerals.
I decided it best that I take a back seat in regard to his decision.
I am equally proud of him however as he is developing into a fine young man.

 

That's wonderful, but not representative.

 

Yes it is. It is representative of an American parent and a good model for all parents.
One kid at a time unless you are a collectivist.

Actually it isn't. The average American parent is a single parent involved intensely with his/her own life with occasional times for casual contact with his/her own children. Said children are typically parked in front of a computer or other electronic device eating junk food and becoming obese.
That is representative, unfortunately.
 
 
 
Every day is a new opportunity to further reveal what an ignorant, partisan hack you are.

 

If he is so ignorant, then im sure you can come up with a more persuasive argument than that.
 
 
Oh, goody. Another "America Sucks And It's Conservatives' Fault -- Somehow -- It Just Is" thread from Shintao.  
 
 
US=30% obese, nearly as many diabetics, skyrocketing rates of ADHD and Autism disorders, we still watch an average of 7 hours tv/day.

In Japan almost nobody is obese, and every single student studies martial arts in grade school. I know, I went to school there. I got to visit a Japanese school for advanced students when I was 7yo. The level of focus and discipline was off the charts. Even the poor kids in the streets were sharp hustlers before they were 10yo.

Is it any wonder that we are slipping as a world power?

there is quite a cultural emphasis on personal responsibility and good citizenship there too, no?
 
 
But, but America is number 1 we just have to be...

Damn statistics lie!

all just commie propaganda.

Your argument is that you were in high school 10 years ago? Really??? WTF???

 

Uhh, lets try this Ribeye style...

"Dooooy, translation: Oh shit he's right, schools are still doing sports. Fuck, what do I do, quick, insult him!"

 

I guess this thread didnt exactly turn out like you thought, eh? You are now arguing against your own position.

 

Hmm, lets see.

- Most members agree on a variety of surrounding issues,

- Adults are talking and dissecting the small differences in opinion, largely civil conversation over details,

- And you look like your typical jackass self, unilaterally clinging to your proposal that evul libruls have successfully legislated against competition.

So no, I'd say the thread has progressed exactly like I thought.

No, not really. The stuff Ribeye says is so stupid that one doesn't even know how begin to address it.
 
 
As a retired Army officer with a little over 20 years of active service, I can say that American soldiers seem to have a natural aptitude for war. For the majority, and I'm talking about a huge percentage, the task is to shape and form the natural instinct of killing rather as opposed to teaching some wimpy cream puff how to cowboy the fuck up and be a warrior.

I suspect it will remain so.

We Americans, whether we like to admit it or not, are very good at violence.

unfortunately, not all military functions involve killing. There will be the guarding of Iraqi POWs just as an instance

lol. See, you could have just let it go quietly, but you had to run that big, really dumb mouth of yours. Let's revisit that first post and we'll see if I can't address it in a more meaningful way.

 
Hmml lets see here.
Competition has been declared bad for children's fragile ego by the Left, thus banned in most schools. Really? Most schools, huh? I'm not aware of any. Then you'll have no problem naming one. Until you do... Bullshit.
Contact sports have been deemed too dangerous and too prone to lawsuits by the Left, thus banned in most schools. Really? Most schools, huh? I'm not aware of any. Then you'll have no problem naming one. Until you do... Bullshit.
Patriotism has been deemed bad by the Left so banned in most places. Patriotism banned? Really? Where? Surely you can name one place. I'm not aware of any. Until you do... Bullshit.
The Boy Scouts have been deemed bad by the Left, so constantly facing persecution. Really? Can you please show us some evidence of this constant undeserved persecution the Boy Scouts have received? Until you do... Bullshit.

How has any of this been the fault of conservatives, who are all in favor of competitions and training for kids??

 

So, yes, it's hard to come up with a cognitive argument when all you do is spout ridiculous made-up bullshit... Except to say that, until you prove it...
 

edit:
Is this the type of thing you're talking about?
 http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/...ess-bans_x.htm 
ELEMENTARY schools banning tag and the like? Is THAT the problem where libruls are destroying the country from the inside out?
 
 
You bash me and then proceed to prove my points.
 Happy Families: Kids, Sport, and Competition 

What a dolt.
 
 
 
And by what standards are you comparing anything?

Our children don't have to learn war immediately. I think that's a blessing. They will learn it soon enough.

Though training the kids isn't a completely bad idea. But my guess is you want the government to oversea it.

 

Yeah, I want the government to oversee it. I want the surgeon general off his ass doing something he is paid for. You neocons raised hell when Obama started neighborhood duty's for the kids. The fat lil punks are dying of clogged arteries by 15 years old. I wouldn't mind seeing the kids get some discipline and exercise at a early age. Get it ingrain in them they have to work hard, they have to clean up their neighborhoods and respect all adults. Japan is doing the right thing with their children. IMO Asians in general work with their children to form morals, ethics, skills, and traditions. No wonder we are on the bottom of cesspool for education, and living in chaos. By and large our kids all have negligent parents, so YES, let government step in and straighten their asses out.
 
 
 
As attractive a concept it may seem, these 'acadamies' in Russia are hangovers from the cold war that feed propaganda and rhetoric into an impressionable mind that should be focused on playing and exploring basic social skills; not being drilled and intimidated by possibly damaged or unstable adults. And the gymnastics schools you've noted are few and far between in China. Only a select few are accepted into what can turn-out to be a life-long commitment.

 

I should have provided this pic instead. Chinese exercise daily in schools.

 
 
 
 
I took Karate classes at about the age of those chillin' in the picture... And they gymnastics/sports machine cult in the U.S. is not terribly different from abroad.

I don't think the divide is as great as you make it seem.

 

When we count the fat filled arteries of todays children, I think the divide is massive. And just as execerise is important to phyisical and mental development, so are the lessons of morals and ethics, skills & traditions. I am glad you had someone that cared about you enough to give you karate and an outlook of life that is different than those around you. These are skills our people need as a way of life. My dad was a golden glove boxer, and he taught us how to box and how to defend ourselves so we were never intimidated by others around us. That is a confidence most kids do not have.

And it was given to him by individuals, not mandated by the State. HUGE diff.

That was then, this is now. If parents can't do the job, which obviously they can't, who should do it for them? Should their first lesson be a mugger on the street, or someone experienced to teach them defense, and other character skills? You see the current situation of America, and then rail against improving it?? LOL! Oh boy!

So tell us, if China is so great why don't you live there? Too lazy? Don't want to actually have to work 7 days a week to appease your masters? Why exactly aren't you there?

Lets see asshole, and you are an asshole to suggest any American abandon his country, you are really shit, feces, to say that to anyone, you unAmerican scum.

I fought for my country, I have 2 purple hearts, 2 bronze battle stars, and the Gallantry Cross unit citation. I think that gives me the right to ask for a better America. Now fuck off asshole!

Based on your self professed love for China I doubt everything you claim. My father served in Korea and VN and would pound you into chitlins for trying to pull this crap. America is about individual freedoms and individual responsibility not some hive mind ant colony horse shit so you can take your false outrage and shove up your keester bucko.
You preach the ANTITHESIS of what made the US great.

Now take your sorry butt to China you disingenuous twerp!

Your father wouldn't do shit, so STFU!!! At least he understood what honor and freedom is about, something you are lacking puke. Suck mah cock you unAmerican piece of shit.
 
 
i hate to really throw a wrench into things. But why is it essential that we be number one as long as we are free?
 
 
America's soul is dead and/or dying. It's transforming into this mindless consumer machine that produces nothing of value and, like a parasite, exploits the third world for a profit while outsourcing what's left of American industry.

From Miles Davis to Hannah Montana
From economic powerhouse to a debt-ridden, high unemployment shadow of its former self
From policemen treating their fellow citizens with respect to taze-happy psychopaths who think every citizen is a criminal
From flying with ease to being groped or virtually strip searched by some TSA goon
From the right to privacy to CCTVs watching what you do
From denouncing torture to practicing it without a second thought

Put a fork in America. She's done.
 
 
 
i hate to really throw a wrench into things. But why is it essential that we be number one as long as we are free?

 

BEcause without being Number 1 we will rapidly become unfree.

I got to say, I find no fault in this post, especially clean up the neighborhoods, here in California, in Dana Point specifically, the closer you get to the school the more garbage you see in the streets and sidewalk.

As far as the government stepping in, which one, the Democrat or Republican government.

I think its time for the government to step out and the only way to do that is to take away the ability of the government to collect money in any form, lotteries, taxes, fees, whatever they call the collection of money, get rid of all tax, we need no more public education, make it all private, and start enforcing laws.

No more graffiti, I am looking at graffiti right now and I say shoot anyone caught in the act. Send em all to prison forever.

The problem with society is the government. A thousand laws on the books and they let child rapist go free after they are caught red-handed.

Imagine, criminals can break into your house and they are free the next day.

Death penalty for breaking and entering, thats the problem with the USA, a bunch of pacifists who dont recognize a bad dog after it bites them.

Kill the criminals, take the money away from the politicians, end public schools. Stop illegal immigration, destroy the failed government of Mexico and take whatever we can to pay for the poor that had to flee that country which are now struggling to stay in our education system.

I could go on but its bedtime in Rio. Coincidently the police just shoot a man on a motorcycle five houses down from where I stay in Rio, shoot first, never ask questions, run from a cop here and its disrespect, paid for by getting shot.

The cops say they shot in the air and the guy crashed, right, from a moving car, chasing a bike, the cops shoot in the air, I think they shot after the guy crashed, while the guy was on the ground, I saw the flash, I heard the siren get turned on after the gunfire.

Anyhow, the police in Rio shoot first, never ask questions.
