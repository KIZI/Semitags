Ghana is likely to be banned by FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF)
from international soccer for alleged government interference in the sport
administration.

Former president of Sports Writers Association of Ghana (SWAG), Ebo Quansah, has
written to FIFA, asking it to investigate the issue.

In a letter to FIFA, CAF, Ghana Football Association (GFA) and the Ghanaian
government on September 26, the former SWAG boss claimed that the pursuit by the
Serious Fraud Office (SFO) to investigate sponsorships acquired by GFA amounted
to governmental interference.

He also cited as another form of invasion by the government the alleged request
by government operatives to seek the removal of GFA officials from office to be
replaced by sympathizers of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) party.

According to Quansah, the pressure went an octave higher after Ghanaian
president John Mills returned later last month from Switzerland where he had
discussions with the FIFA president and maintained that they had been given the
right to investigate the GFA.

"I cannot believe that FIFA would allow the kind of interference that resulted
in the leadership of Ghana football being hauled before the Serious Fraud
Office," Quansah said in his petition to the sport governing body.

The West African country nearly missed the boat to the commonwealth games in New
Delhi, India, as a result of an impasse between government and officials of the
Ghana Olympic Committee (GOC).

FIFA frowns on interference by governments in sport administrations and
countries which fall prey to it risks being banned.

FIFA banned Nigeria from international soccer last week over government invasion
in that country.
