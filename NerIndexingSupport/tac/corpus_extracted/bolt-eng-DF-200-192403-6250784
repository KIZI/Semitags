Basically my long term girlfriend of two years cheated on me with my bestfriend last week so i had to get this off my chest, at first she was very sorry and sad, but i immediatly told her it was over. I found out because i was at home revising when this **** went down and my friends told me. I havent spoke to my best friend since the incident, what troubled me the most is when i asked her why she did it last night, she said "well he is just so much better looking than you." I felt so bitter and self concious after that so i was wondering is he that much better looking than me, just need a few opinions. By the way i know it sounds like im trolling but it is genuine story.  
The boy in the waistcoat is me and the guy with the polo top was my best friend
 
 
If your ex jumps from guy to guy *solely* on looks ESPECIALLY after 2 years then the problem clearly isn't with appearance - she's a bit of a *****.

She's shallow so don't see it as much of a loss. Good to hear you immediately cut it off though don't bother making any effort you're the last person that needs to do any crawling.

Move on.

OP do you have more than one picture of yourself? Otherwise I'm more inclined to believe that this is a troll with a couple of pictures pulled from google images.
 
 
 
Why are you hmmm?

This is how people are. The women are shallow gold diggers and "best friends" will stab you when your not on your guard. Learn from this event.

yer these are more pics if u want
 
 
The other lad has a more prettyish face but he also looks a lot younger and looks a bit too asian rudeboy. Emphasis on boy. Too cherubic if you get me, although he could grow out of it.

I can see he (polotop) is better looking in a sense, but if I had to choose I'd go for the guy on the left, who looks a bit more down to earth, and a bit manlier and friendlier. Although those are probably totally irrational judgements! So there OP, I fancy you more, if it is actually you.
 
 
 
yer these are more pics if u want

 

These are different guys to the first two??  
 
 
OP looks like Peter Andre in his first picture, from his 'Mysterious girl' days lol

An asian version of him, yes.

It's the greasy curtain hairstyle I think.

that WTF?
 
 
 
nooo its me but different hairstyles first and last taken a year apart

 

Not buying it, sorry OP  
 
 
That is an embarrassingly bad story you made up just so you could disguise an "am I better looking" thread. Just terrible.
 
 
Was there any need to post pictures? Really?
 
 
 
Not buying it, sorry OP  

 

Those 3 pics i put out are of me the guy in the waistcoat i dont know why you believe they are different people, just my hair is done differently
 
 
 
Was there any need to post pictures? Really?

 

Its a self confidence thing  
 
 
He may be better looking to her. Attractiveness is subjective.

Edit - Even if you don't, you're at the University of Birmingham
 
 
 
lol you're one cheeky c*** mate.

 

busteeed! pls tell us he's made this up..
 
 
Birmingham was obvious.
 
 
Your decent looking. You look much better in the last few pics   Hoook me up with your friend   jk but he's attractive.. Most girls like that 'badboy' kind of look that your friend has. I'm sure you'll find a decent girl bro, move on.
 
 
Your friend looks like Zayn from One Direction.

Your best friend is better looking.. because you have long hair. But looks aside, it's all about personality if a girl screws you over for guy better looking, she's a ***. **** her seriously, 2 years!? Come on, she can't have been real if she hooked up with your best friend because she's obviously known him while she was going out with you. I hate when people cheat, it's like why are you even in a relationship!? Seriously dude, cut your hair and all the girls will be after you, and as for your long term girlfriend... she can go to hell.
 
 
Your friend: I can imagine him running me over in his VW Golf.
You: You need to tie your tie properly (first pic).

So what's going on here?
 
 
I'm still struggling to find out which one OP is... :/
 
 
 
So what's going on here?

 

I wanna know too
 
 
Basically guy number 2 looks like Zayn from 1 direction
 
 
 
Your friend looks like Zayn from One Direction.

 

Yeah I thought this as well
 
 
I have one mutual friend with you! :O
 
 
He is better looking than you, but you are by no means unattractive. If she is shallow enough to fall for looks, then you're better off alone. She isn't going to stay pretty forever, and one day when she's old and wrinkly or suffering from, say, post-natal weight gain, someone else will cheat on her.

My boyfriend isn't exactly physically attractive (short and chubby) nor is he well-off financially, but I can see past looks and money. My friends keep telling me I can do better but at the end of the day, all I want is a nice person who treats me like a princess.  

Keep looking, Genia, you definitely deserve better.

P.S. I really don't think you should be posting his pictures on a forum unless you have his permission. :-/

Think I may be the only one who got this

Kakakak! You evil thing, I like your style  

Bitch'll get what's coming to her in the end aye OP, and you're a handsome chap dw - the lad's just a boy, and if she prefers 'boys' then that's her loss eh  
 
 
 
Kakakak! You evil thing, I like your style  

 

B-b-but it's trueeeee :P

If this isn't a troll then..

Your friend has the typical boy band/justin bieber look which so many idiotic girls fall for these days. He looks like a queer if you ask me and they tend to rely on being more feminine/touchy-feely to get poon.

Why waste time with her?
 
 
She upgraded. Sorry dude but he's considerably hotter than you.

Girls fall for those types of guys?...I'm not so sure.

Justin Timberlake, Justin Bieber, usher, Boy bands such as Take that and the new ones I CBA to remember and JLS.

You telling me the masses of girls.women dont go for those looks over guys who are in fact, better looking in the mature-looking/real man department?

Females have skewed versions of what men are these days.

I think that's a younger girl thing, to be honest, to like the more feminine man.. That changes as you get older. For example, I remember first watching LOTR as a wee nipper and fawning over how pretty Legolas was. Now when I see it, it's all about an Aragorn and Boromir sandwich  
 
 
I bet he wears cuffed chinos with white Air Force Ones
 
 
You both look like utter *****. Your taste in girls would support this.
 
 
Well, considering you are just trying to get comments to rate yourself, I have taken the time to organise the earlier posts into a much more consumer friendly scale.

Ugly ---*----------------- Below Average.

Oh yeah but women in the mid-late 20s are either all for JLS guys who fawn over their mirror or George Clooney. Now nothing against Clooney but they forget he is more smoke and mirrors and he is an actor.

They take his films as a true character portrait!

 
 
 
 
bestfriend, immediatly, havent spoke, self concious, im

 

Best friend, immediately, haven't spoken, self-conscious, I'm.

Oh, and the photo: Harold and Kumar??
 
 
C'mon man... you stop talking 2 ur best friend but carry on talking 2 the one which betrayed you more??
if the girl was grinding on him then he did what most people would do...  . it was obviously mainly her fault
 
 
Who the **** cares? She's a slut at the end of the day. After being with you for two years she decided to sleep with your best friend based solely on the fact that he's 'better looking'. This shows she never really cared about you, and its better that you found who she really was now instead of her cheating on you when you're both married with two kids.
 
 
Feel free to relieve some of your pent up anger by PM-ing us all the naked shots of the dirty slut
