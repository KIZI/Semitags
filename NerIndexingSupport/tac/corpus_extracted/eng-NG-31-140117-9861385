You still have meaningful baseball in October. You can go back to your
favorite pastime of rooting against the Yankees.

All you little Bitches can break out the Red Sox hats you bought in 04 and
pray that the Yankees don't win their 27th title or their 5th title since
the mets last won.

And if the Yankees loose then you can all do you little Bo Jangles tapdance
in the dugout just like Reyes, and Delgado used to do when things went well

I hope you little Bitches had a chance to cherish your moment of domation
this past may when you were beating Darrel Rasner and talking about owning
this town.

Don't worry little Bitches, you will always have the memory of advancing one
round further than the Yankees in 06. Its a shame they don't throw ticker
tape parades for winning a Division Series against the Dodgers

That's the spirit. You just proved my point.,You still have your favorite
pastime of rooting against the Yankees.

And given the Yankees history of winning 26 out of 103 World Series titles
you have approximately a 77% chance of calling your season a success..

See Met fans the glass is Half full .

And you can go back to your favorite pastime of hiding under the bed,
whining about the Yankees, for most of the season until you feel safe
doing otherwise, and making Wretch look like an honorable, deent and
courageous human being, if only by comparison to you.

Umm, it's YOU who is in the Mets newsgroup. I think (as usual)
you asshole Yankee fans have things confused. As you say, you've
won so often that your only true joy is in gloating over the
misery of others.

Oh, and if we use the percentages since 2000, we have a 100%
chance of success.

BTW remember that because your beloved team is only getting into
the playoffs as the wild card, it doesn't really count. Remember
what was said about the Red Sox when they won, they it did not
count because they were the wild card.

Wretch is a troll who, apart from his choiuce of baseball teams, has a
minimal degree of standards, and occasionally, a shred of dignity.
Well, almost. Sort of.

You, on the other hand, have been consistently afraid to show your face
here except on those rare occasions in the past few yars when the
Yankees were actually higher than the Mets in the standings, and afraid
even to name the team you rooted for.

Talk about a bitches! There's a chuihuaha next door with more cojones
than you, and it was just neutered.

Have a good time with the steroid-riddled pussies in the Bronx who
backed into the Wild Card by losing (again), and enjoy at least six
more years of The Curse.

 

None there to laugh at. My team is still around, is not now celebrating
backing in to the league's Wild Card by losing, and is not surviving on
alternate scraps of the glory of years gone by and threats to their
players and coaches. And it's still doing it on half of that other
team's payroll.

This is the guy who refused, in ritualistic fashion, to specifically
name the team he was rooting for, because he was afraid we'd make fun
of them, a couple-three years ago. It's taken him this long to acquire
the stones to return. Bravo!

Of course, we can only assume he won't have too much to say to us here,
and will be gone for quite a while, in a week or so.

Why would the Yankees want to fire a winning manager and hire a losing
one?
