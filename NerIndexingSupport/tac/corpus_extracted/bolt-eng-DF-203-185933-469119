Mostly because I want Tebow to feel like God loves him a little bit less than everyone else tonight.
 
 
As much as I hate to admit it, I wouldn't mind it either. Because I'd like to see them for a third time this season, with the same result.

Amen.
 
 
We are obviously hoping for a Steeler's win, but this game is making DH nervous!!
 
 
Boo to this post! I'm hoping for not a Steelers win.

Sorry to burst your bubble...but win or lose, I doubt Tebow will feel that way. One of the nice things about God is that his love isn't dependent upon our achievements.
And of course...I want the Broncos to win.  
 
 
Right now at my house, you would like DH was at the game. He is yelling and stomping his feet. I made the mistake to say "oh....its a tie game" and he was like "Well, duh"....sorry I was making sure the dog wasn't eating plastic!
 
 
Love the reasoning behind it.

This!
 
 
Oh this should be interesting. First ever tie that won't end in sudden death. I like the new rule and think each team should get a possession in regular season ties too.
 
 
Bwahaha Panda that pip is awesome!!

Agreed!
 
 
And the Steelers are knocked out!
 
 
JESUS LIVES!

Well unless they score a touch down and then it's over. My H's victory screams were a little scary. I guess the rule is to prevent the team that wins the coin toss to just go down and get a field goal.
 
 
TEBOW!!!

. Well said!!
 
 
As far as Tebow is concerned, I defer to Suggs:
"With all due respect, we don’t pray on the sideline,” he said. “We do — we give it up to God to keep us safe and healthy. When our quarterback prays, he’s like, ‘God, sit on the couch and enjoy this. Thank you for blessing me and letting me wake up and play this game. I’m going to impress you.’”

There ya go!
Tebow can suck it.

Oh Panda I thought we were friends.....Sapphy you two are killing me. I have to rep Tebow...I do live in Denver.  
 
 
 
 
LOL. I'm really impartial about Tebow, until he comes to my city. And even then it stays on the field! :)

LOL. From far away, I was like...Dumbledore....is that you?
 
 
Bottom line, he needs to learn to play well in all 4 quarters before I'll give him any credit. I won't be patting him on the back because he had yet another come from behind miracle victory until he learns how to play THE WHOLE GAME. I don't care what he believes or does on the sideline, spiritually speaking.

This is my real problem with him. He's overrated, and ESPN is annoying to watch because everyone is jocking him so hard. He's not consistent and he's not stellar. He gets breaks because he has a great defense. The Broncos are a good team, but NOT because he is a good QB. His spirituality is obnoxious to me, but not the reason I dislike him.

I agree with your reasoning, but he had quite a game tonight. The Broncos led for most of it, holding the Steelers to field goals in the first two quarters. Then the Steelers railled at the end of the third quarter, and the Broncos finished it.

I agree that he needs to play better in all quarters not just the 4th, but tonight the Broncos led from the 2nd quarter on and he did play well. One game isn't everything and of course he needs to be able to do that consistently. I think he's a good player, just one that everyone either loves or loves to hate.

Holding them to field goals is an accomplishment of the defense, not of Tebow. Sure he played like a normal quarteback should for most of the game... for once. That doesn't mean I have to hand out exhaultations to the guy like the rest of the freakin' world is. It's not a love-hate thing to me, it's brining the nonsense and media frenzy back down to earth and reality.

I know you aren't one of them but the media frenzy is there because people go to such extremes with him. They love them or they hate them. Then the lovers love them more because people hate on him. I think he's a good player but I'm not going to kneel down to him anytime soon. I married a die hard Florida fan so I was his fan when he really was spectacular in college.
 
 
I would have liked both teams to lose.

Oh yeah, I was thinking you said the TEAM needed to play well all 4 quarters, not just Tebow. He has fantastic pass protection that makes him look good.

ESPN gets on their knees for many a player. It's what they do, and it is annoying.
 
 
What an exciting game! Good to the last second.
