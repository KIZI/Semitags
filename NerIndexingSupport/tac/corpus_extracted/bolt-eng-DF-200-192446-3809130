The objective part of my post:

This was on tv recently, but it's more of a political/current affair so I thought I'd post it here.

It's on iPlayer at the moment, I'd highly recommend watching it.

 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-14017865 

It's about this campsite

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Farm 

Some more news on the matter

 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-14017865 

The subjective part of my post:

This council is absolute disgusting, retarded, and racist, and I completely agree with the gypsy's right to live there. This isn't about "oh they didn't have planning permission bla bla bla", this is about giving them and their children STABLE HOMES and not having to constantly be on the move. Contrary to their name (travellers), many of them are settling down in permanent residents.

I just do not see why anyone in their right minds would endorse this kind of public removal. The gypsies OWN THE LAND, let them build damn houses on it, they need somewhere to live, you know?

I have absolutely no connection that I can see that would make me biased in this viewpoint, yet I feel so strongly about this that if it wasn't so damn far away from where I am (Liverpool) I would definitely travel and join the activists and the gypsy army that is going to gather there.

The part of my post where it gets interesting:

Clearly this just isn't going to happen easily. At the end of the show, it shows the gypsies creating makeshift flamethrowers out of gas canisters, making petrol bombs, and making huge barbed wire fences, etc. The gypsies are even saying they are prepared to die to defend their homes. Someone also mentioned that should the council try anything, lots of the travellers are going to travel to the site to help with the "effort". Lastly, and to me sickeningly, the council are prepared to spend A WHOLE THIRD OF THEIR BUDGET - Â£8 MILLION - on evicting these people from their homes. HOW do these idiot politicians get into positions of power?

All I can say is that if those travellers do respond with force and violence - which I hope they do - I fully and completely endorse it, as it's standing up to bureaucratic bullying.
 
 
Let me ask you why you think it's so acceptable for people to think they can just run around breaking the law?

If building a little house for your family to live in, on land that you LEGALLY OWN, is breaking the law, then the law be damned. "The law" is not some infallible tome, it is erroneous.

Yep, i agree, i mean look..
 

Just one little house, why should anyone require permission to build that?

It's called the law for a reason.
 
 
Gypsies are vermin and should be arrested for avoiding tax or denied all services.
I think the council is right in removing them as they will be very bad for the area.
 
 
i watched that

why don't they try to sell their land (for which they would get A LOT of money (i'm sure they could strike a deal with the council)) and buy houses and settle in proper housing estates in the city, thereby integrating with the community.

why don't they value their children's futures and just comply with the law, move to normal houses. Why don't they encourage their children to go schools and universities for a better life, and do whats best for them, instead of encouraging violence, and rebellious undignified chavvy behaviour.

i find that they have this "we all have to live together in a field FOREVER AND EVER and CANNOT mix with the world, or come to a compromise that's good for our children's future" attitude.
 
 
 
Yep, i agree, i mean look..

Did I say one house? Nope. They have large families and need houses to live in   - what do you want them to do, have 6 kids and 2 adults living in squalor in a tiny little caravan?

Pathetic.

'If building a little house for your family to live in,'
Herpy derpy derp (:

How about getting a normal house? Even if it is a council house, or rent a place and actually provide a stable life for their familie thus allowing their children a better future?

You act as if this is the only way they can live, it isn't, it is far from it, you are ignorant.

"value their children's futures"? "go to schools and universities for a better life"? "do what's best for them"? This is exactly the kind of bigoted, racist, xenophobic attitude that I detest. Just because someone's lifestyle is different to your own doesn't automatically make yours superior. Who are you to say that the gypsy lifestyle isn't a "better life" than the lifestyle enjoyed by anyone else?
 
 
 
'If building a little house for your family to live in,'

 

I can't believe I actually have to explain this, isn't this supposed to be a student forum?  

I said:

"If building a little house for your family to live in"

There are (at a rough guess) 80 families in Dale Farm.

Therefore, if every family builds a house, how many houses is that? Come on, I'm sure you can do it. What's 80 multiplied by one?  

Now, is the answer you have one? Nope. I'll forgive you for making such a glaring mistake though - it's late.

Well done, i'm glad it took you that long to do simple maths  
If you couldnt sence the sarcasm in the post with the picture you are as idiotic as you sound here, silly little boy  

Good job for ignoring the main point though, congrats on that   How cute.

More & better education = better life.

They've got to live somewhere - why not there? Are they spoiling someone's view?

Ah, the old "Damn, I realised my mistake, now I'll try and make out like I knew it all along"  
 
 
If they really cared about providing stable homes for their kids and better futures they wouldn't pull their daughters out of education at 12-14 so they can stay home looking after their family then get married at 16 and then do nothing with their lives except make babies and restart the whole cycle. Or further educate the boys so they can do better things than manual jobs with low pay. Nor does it remove the fact they have a violence culture where they resort to stealing and being anti-social when out in the general public.

It's illegal without planning permission, regardless of whatever their intention. If they break the law they deserve to get kicked out.
 
 
 
They've got to live somewhere - why not there? Are they spoiling someone's view?

 

It's on a green belt. Evidently having a patch of grass is more important to society than having a place for people to raise children and live their lives stably.

The funny thing is that I'm actually a pretty hardcore environmentalist, so naturally I'd be hugely inclined for the defense of green belts, but really, this whole thing sickens me.
 
 
 
They've got to live somewhere - why not there? Are they spoiling someone's view?

 

Rent a house.
Buy a house with a job.
Get in to council housing.
Etc Etc Etc. All options that will undoubtedly lead to a better future for the family.

They are doing it illegally.
They are ruining the green belt land.
They have been known to be anti-social and the old 'if you try kick us out it will get violent' just reinforces how they can be.

Don't see why people think these guys should be exempt from the law.

 
Ah, the old &quot;Damn, I realised my mistake, now I'll try and make out like I knew it all along&quot;  

 

Continuing to ignore any intelligent discussion.

Little kids should not be up this late.

Still taking the idiotic view that this is the only place they can live.

They are not Gypsies. Travellers and gypsies are not the same thing at all, despite similar characteristics.

As for the rest, nyah, both sides have their points, to be honest.

Just because you disagree with their lifestyle gives you no right to criticise their culture. I could say that I admire gypsy women for raising families and living simple lives instead of joining the consumerist, greedy, money-driven rat race. But that's a different issue entirely.

Seriously, what the **** is with these people saying "the law is the law". Just because something is the law does not imply anything about its morality. It was the law in Nazi Germany that Jews were seen as sub-human, would you have stood idly by and said "the laws the law I'm afraid, everyone should follow it?" Seriously   Godwins law or what.
 
 
 
They've got to live somewhere - why not there? Are they spoiling someone's view?

 

Btw, take whatever reply you get to this message with a pinch of salt. For people like Tommyjw, his lifestyle and his culture is the best, end of story, and anyone who doesn't follow his way of life should just "git out!".

Buy a house with a job.

They're ruining green belt land? So they *are* spoiling someone's view, not to mention conning some grass out of a comfortable life! Why should they get a job? If they want to live on a campsite all they life then I don't see why it bothers you.

And I laugh at "They have been known to be anti-social" - as if kicking them out will make a difference! It will transfer the problem somewhere else, not solve it.
 
 
 
&quot;value their children's futures&quot;? &quot;go to schools and universities for a better life&quot;? &quot;do what's best for them&quot;? This is exactly the kind of bigoted, racist, xenophobic attitude that I detest. Just because someone's lifestyle is different to your own doesn't automatically make yours superior. Who are you to say that the gypsy lifestyle isn't a &quot;better life&quot; than the lifestyle enjoyed by anyone else?

 

bigoted? i think not

education doesn't just open up possibilities to a better life, it also makes a person more intellectual and cultured.

racist and xenophobic?
my mum's French and my dad's Indian, so no.

I never declared the gypsy lifestyle to be lesser than any. In this instance they clearly are not gypsies. They seem to like the "idea" of being gypsies and being called travellers.

They are all settled on a field. Why not settle in houses in city communities instead of being segregated and bigoted and xenophobic themselves.

You sound like one of those hippies with the "anything goes, down with law and society, angst is cool" attitude.

Think past your silly hippie notions and think realistically.

I don't have any negative feelings for those Irish people. I feel bad for them, having to move out. But I don't see them trying to make any mature decisions either.
It's mostly trash talk.

Oh i guess you don't mind all those people scrounging benefits for no reason then? Why should they get a job right?  

It bothers me when they are doing it illegally yet people seem to think this is okay just because it's them.

This isn't some amazing controversial new law that people in the past and future will disagree with
(such like that kids idiotic comparison to the times in Germany   )
These are established, fair and normal laws.

 
And I laugh at "They have been known to be anti-social" - as if kicking them out will make a difference! It will transfer the problem somewhere else, not solve it.
 

No, it won't, how ridiculous.

They will live in different places, they will not find an area and all 80 odd families join the same street etc. Their community is a large part of any violence that happens (whether it is from or against them) so to say it will stay the same is just naive and stupid.

Don't try and worm your way out of it. Your exact words were "why dont they value their children's futures". Thus, you were making a valuation which stated that the future of the children would be worse under a gypsy lifestyle than under your lifestyle. That's bigoted.

Also rofl at the fact that you think being part French and part Indian somehow makes you exempt from being a racist. Using that logic, no White person, or Black person, or Chinese person, or anyone on Earth can ever be racist or xenophobic.  
 
 
I don't get it. If they're travellers then surely that's what they're meant to do?
 
 
 
all those people scrounging benefits for no reason then? Why should they get a job right?

 

Oh my word, it's almost as if he's trying to be a political cliche. "Damn gypsies, stealing our benefits, breaking our laws"

Firstly. It is clear fact that a child would have a better education outside of that community. Due to the sometimes 'secure' nature of these communities, they will often have less interaction with people outside of them thus also at a 'disadvantage'; there when compared to a child growing up outside of it. Etc.

Secondly, this is nowhere near a bigoted opinion. Please learn what a word means before shouting it around like you do.

Well that's a problem with the law, not them. I thought you had to be looking for work to claim benefits.

 
It bothers me when they are doing it illegally yet people seem to think this is okay just because it's them.

 

Because they're not hurting anyone.

I don't care how long ago the law was created - and it's not fair.

 
No, it won't, how ridiculous.

I thought the violence only occurred when the state tried to evict them from their homes. Nonetheless, the problem will resurface in the future on another site. They're still the same people and simply putting them in another place will not change their attitude to the government and will simply provide them with a different community to harness. Where are they all supposed to go anyway?

Unsurprisingly, you've completely missed the point.

The statement you've used, which is broadly "Gypsy children are at a disadvantage in education" is fundamentally different to the one Hugo used, which was broadly "Gypsy children will have a worse future because of a disadvantaged education".
 
 
 
Well that's a problem with the law, not them. I thought you had to be looking for work to claim benefits.

 

Well.. no.. i wasn't really specific about what types of benefits and such but some of them, not all.

 
I don't care how long ago the law was created - and it's not fair.
 

It's not fair?

A neighbor creates a large 'dome' in his garden thus stopping you from seeing anything from 75% of your windows and stopping you seeing anything from your garden etc. You cannot do anything about it. I assume this is fair to you?

It wont resurface on another site. It is known that sites are falling, more and more are simply merging in to existing communities and living in 'normal' homes because of it. Especially with the change in the law in like 94 we aren't obliged to provide land for them so the 'numbers' will continue to fall,. unless something changes.

80 families?' Where are all they ' meant to go? 80 families is nothing compared to the existing people renting houses, in council houses or just on the housing market etc. Its being naive to suggest they are stuck there or something.

No it's not.
Being at a disadvantage in something means future results will be affected by it, in this example it means future education exams, results and prospects will be negatively affected by it.

He said what i did, just a longer version.

Just hilarious how you are so naive you keep denying/ignoring it. The community and lifestyle they have means they ultimately will have a worse educational future, it is fact.

Nope. Having a worse educational future =! having a worse future.
 
 
 
Nope. Having a worse educational future =! having a worse future.

 

It does when the clear context of the discussion is about education.

But, even out of that context, education can easily be said to be in line with quality of lifestyle.

To say there is no correlation between quality of education and quality of life is silly. The correlation is quite large imo
 
 
Someone's 'ownership' of land doesn't give them an inherent right to develop this land by erecting a house. This is the point of incorporating planning permission into the law.

To allow houses to spring up wherever the owner of the land deems this to be what they desire would lead to haphazard housing that encroached on neighbour's land/enjoyment of their land; which would undermine the concept of personal property (ownership of land and the right for any proposed changes to be made through the correct channels, which allows the owner that'll be affected the opportunity to contest them).
 
 
 
education can easily be said to be in line with quality of lifestyle.

 

Where does happiness come into the equation?

You can only say someone will have a "better future" if, by better future, you mean they are happier. And vice versa. Because after you have went through all the statistics and indexes etc, e.g. wealth and education and health etc, the only thing that ultimately matters is the happiness of the individual.
 
 
 
Just because you disagree with their lifestyle gives you no right to criticise their culture. I could say that I admire gypsy women for raising families and living simple lives instead of joining the consumerist, greedy, money-driven rat race. But that's a different issue entirely.

Seriously, what the **** is with these people saying "the law is the law". Just because something is the law does not imply anything about its morality. It was the law in Nazi Germany that Jews were seen as sub-human, would you have stood idly by and said "the laws the law I'm afraid, everyone should follow it?" Seriously   Godwins law or what.

 

You have to obey the laws regardless of how you feel morally. Or everyone would be going "I'll just steal this, because I reallyyyyyyy want it and I don't care about this particular law because stealing benefits me." or "I'll just kill that guy, because he really pissed me off and I don't feel like obeying the law right now."  

In Nazi Germany people had to obey the law, they may not have agreed to Nazi policies on Jews but if they didn't comply they came under threat themselves being punished for being a traitor to their 'race' and national interest. They may not have liked it, which is why so many people tried to keep their heads down and carry on with life while their Jewish friends/neighbours perished.

I'm pointing out that it's hypocritical for them to claim to want to give their kids a better life when having no desire for them to excel at life by going to school. I admire gypsies who go carry on education and go out to jobs they wouldn't normally because it breaks the norms of their society. These kids are being groomed into thinking these certain paths are the only things they can or should do or are given no control over their life. Did you see the way girls are 'grabbed' by boys, it's hardly their choice and none seem to enjoy it. I haven't got anything against women who do become housewives of their own choice but teaching them it is their only worth is a mindset that belongs in the Victorian era.

Planning permission is there for a reason; it prevents unsafe homes being built and makes sure they are regulated. Ealing council came under fire for tons of illegal homes springing up in back gardens to accommodate illegal immigrants because these houses weren't suitable to live in, no heating, cramped conditions, electrical wiring everywhere, no running water or anything. It didn't look like these people where any better off than where they came from. Likewise, if the gypsies are building unsafe, unregulated and illegal buildings they need to come down.

Quality of life incorporates happiness.

Again. There is a clear correlation between quality of education and how 'happy' you will be.
Happiness includes family life, community spirit, family life etc (all of which i assume are the type of things we are saying these travelers have, which i agree). However there is also things such as job satisfaction, satisfaction gained from having a large income, big house, nice car etc, cba to list all the normal things.

Basically. To sum up everything.

The traveler children are at a disadvantage for being in that community. Some may say that this is a bad thing and the parents should not want this for their child (thus move out etc), i didn't really say that, someone else did, i was just arguing towards how they are at a disadvantage :P

It begs the ultimate question: will those children be happier in a gypsy lifestyle, or happier in a non-gypsy lifestyle?

Can anyone here truly say with certainty that the children would be happier in a non-gypsy lifestyle? Of course they couldn't, but they do anyway, because of bigoted beliefs that their system is the best.

I've tried not to ultimately say a definite answer but i don't see how there is any other conclusion that (on average) you will be 'happier' (all things included. Family, wealth, job, community, house etc) outside of their lifestyle.

Now i agree that THOSE children ultimately may not be happier, given they have grown up in such a culture, not in the short term anyway (may get used to it). For example if me or you were chucked in tomorrow, for a while we just wouldn't be as happy there. But what about their children?

I don't think we should look exclusively at happiness either.

Given a choice of my child being very happy with a 'bad' education or 'happy' with a good education, i'd have to take the second.
 
 
Planning permission is there for a reason. It's not that hard to get planning permission if your proposals for the land are appropriate.
 
 
Just thought I'd point out that they're not some timeless part of the English countryside, they came here from Ireland in the 1960s.

Just in case anyone had any misconceptions.
 
 
We are talking about the development of a whole neighbourhood here! Surely planning applications must be observed, it isn't about something trivial like a conservatory.

To those on the side of the travellers, if a private development company wanted to build an equally sized neighbourhood on green belt land, would you have a problem with it?
Most probably, yes.

So why therefore are gypsies a special case? Shouldn't we all be equal under the law?
 
 
 
If building a little house for your family to live in, on land that you LEGALLY OWN, is breaking the law, then the law be damned. "The law" is not some infallible tome, it is erroneous.

 

It's called greenbelt. You'd have none of it if everybody could build their home on it without planning permission.
 
 
 
[I]I just do not see why anyone in their right minds would endorse this kind of public removal. The gypsies OWN THE LAND, let them build damn houses on it, they need somewhere to live, you know?

 

they may own the land, but theres a little something there missing. its called a planning application. you need them to build things. ESPECIALLY if its a green belt area (which dale farm was built on)
this means that the rules are more strict than normal.

if you dont have planning permission then you cant legally build on the land whether you own it or not. its ILLEGAL hence why they are being evicted.

if you went and bought a field and built a house on it, that would get knocked down too unless you had permission to build said house.

and also i bet the travellers have caused more trouble than shown on the tv. my sister and her friends got beaten up by a bunch of travellers, even though the older group liked them, they feared for their lives and piled 11 people and 3 dogs into a little car just to fled from where they were living at the time. but that didnt get into the news as even the police are affraid of travellers as they mean bad news. youu dont have to be stupid to know that...
 
 
 
They are not Gypsies. Travellers and gypsies are not the same thing at all, despite similar characteristics.

As for the rest, nyah, both sides have their points, to be honest.

 

Same thing, both are tax dodging vermin that simply cause problems to the area.
Kick them out or burn them out.

Crime tends to go up around these sites. It takes over 100 officers to raid a gypsy camp so unless they have to the Police tend to ignore crime, simpley because two officers walking in too these camps won't get anywhere and will be lucky if they come back out in one piece

How can they be travellers if they don't travel. It would be like being a baker and not knowing how to cook. I subjectively see it as the council doing them a massive favour, by getting them back in touch with their ancestory. I like the idea of the old gypsy fortune teller from Romania, just not these caravan skanks who wear garish and vile clothing and are neanderthal like, in appearance and behaviour.
 
 
 
I have absolutely no connection that I can see that would make me biased in this viewpoint, yet I feel so strongly about this that if it wasn't so damn far away from where I am (Liverpool) I would definitely travel and join the activists and the gypsy army that is going to gather there.

 

LOL..... Far, it is only 192 miles away.... how the hell is that far??
You could hitch it in under 5 hours.

I don't care about you, a 10 hour (absolute minimum) return trip is far. Seeing as the actual eviction will probably be carried out in a short amount of time (if it is successful at all, can't see that happening myself though), it would be pointless.

bigoted? i think not

education doesn't just open up possibilities to a better life, it also makes a person more intellectual and cultured.

racist and xenophobic?
my mum's French and my dad's Indian, so no.

I never declared the gypsy lifestyle to be lesser than any. In this instance they clearly are not gypsies. They seem to like the "idea" of being gypsies and being called travellers.

They are all settled on a field. Why not settle in houses in city communities instead of being segregated and bigoted and xenophobic themselves.

You sound like one of those hippies with the "anything goes, down with law and society, angst is cool" attitude.

Think past your silly hippie notions and think realistically.

I don't have any negative feelings for those Irish people. I feel bad for them, having to move out. But I don't see them trying to make any mature decisions either.
It's mostly trash talk.

 

I disagree with the underlined statement. There are plenty of educated but uncultured morons in society.
Some cultures are simply unable to or don't want to integrate with others, I find it foolish that some people insist that they must.

However, they are breaking the law. Is it really that hard buying some land that legally allows them to build their homes on?
 
 
You fools, its a tv show, its not real!

I suggest you look up the meaning of  documentary . I can imagine this guy watching the news:

"Norwegian terrorist? Civil war in Libya? Eurozone crisis? It's not real, it's all a tv show!"
 
 
No. Bluntly, I don't want us to sit idly back and become a nation of shanty-towns. If they want to build relatively decent structures on certain greenbelt land, preferably away from current towns and villages, then I'd happily support them.

A corrugated iron jungle, on the edge of someone's farm, where the place goes utterly to pot and with no facilities and ever-increasing piles of rubbish? No, I certainly wouldn't allow that.
 
 
I watched it and believe that it is wrong for anyone- be that gypsy or non-gypsy- to just build a neighbourhood for themselves without permission. I also dislike the idea that the gypsies on this documentary don't want to integrate with anyone from the 'outside' world, that's quite sad really.
 
 
 
If building a little house for your family to live in, on land that you LEGALLY OWN, is breaking the law, then the law be damned. "The law" is not some infallible tome, it is erroneous.

 

The legal basis on which they own the land carries with it obligations re: planning permission. You can't use the law to justify your point, and then immediately rubbish that same law when you realize it doesn't support your argument.

They are not Gypsies. Travellers and gypsies are not the same thing at all, despite similar characteristics.

 

Well said - the Dale Farm travellers are NOT true English Romany gypsies, and many of them own large properties in Rathkeale, Ireland (see  http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/1117...e_connections/  ). However, the Irish government has adopted a far less lenient stance the UK law, hence why they are here.

I know a lot of people from local communities such as Crays Hill live in fear of these travellers, many of whom run unregistered businesses or contribute to petty crime and antisocial behaviour - unfortunately they do not act like good neighbours and there are large packs of semi-feral dogs running around the site.

Everybody should have a place to live, but they should live there legitimately. Many of the so-called 'temporary' structures on Dale Farm are in fact de facto houses, complete with wrought iron railings and stone lions outside. These people do not 'travel', yet they turn down alternative housing the council has offered them with the excuse that they can't 'settle'. At the end of the day they just want to have their cake and eat it.

If they live in the UK they should abide by the rules all of us have to abide by.
 
 
They don't legally own all of the land which they have settled on, they only own a small section of Dale Farm and the council have no problems with the families who are there legally staying. It's the ones who are there illegally that need moved on.
They love to call themselves 'travellers' yet they don't travel. They have built houses which shows they want to stay there either permanently or for a long time. They want to be called 'travellers' so they don't have to pay taxes yet live as the rest of us do (using NHS, schools, living in houses ect).
There is a feild next to where I live, instead of paying rent I might aswell tarmac over it and stick a house on it so I can live there for free. Because that is exactly what these travellers have done!
If I built an extension on my house or another building in my garden without planning permission it would be knocked down, so why are these people any different?
They could have council houses if they wanted, or rent private housing or get a morgage. But they don't want to.
If they really cared about giving their kids a stable upbringing they would have made sure they had a home where they were legally allowed to live! what sort of parent would sit there knowing their kids would be evicted and have to watch some sort of Travellers V Council war? It's pathetic.
Why do you think they were kicked out of Ireland? because they wouldn't abide by the law FGS.
 
 
Get them out.

Pikeys are nothing but trouble, they have no wish to integrate with the rest of the population, they live by a barbaric social structure. They are uneducated thugs that sort out disputes by beating each other up. They also harass regular people for no other reason that they've got nothing better to do with their pathetic existence.
 
 
Why hasn't the government deported these travellers yet? Or are they counting on someone to do a Brievik there?

All this. The travellers (who are fully intent on remaining in their permanent structures and not tavelling) have been offered council housing, and some of them even own legal pitches in Cambridgeshire, but are deciding not to play ball with the council.

I don't think anybody wants to see so much public money wasted on the eviction, but there is little choice really. If the illegal half of the settlement is allowed to remain it sets a dangerous precedent nationally with regards to planning laws for unauthorised development and traveller settlements.

It's important to maintain our green belts, as without them Britain would be a US-style sprawl of retail parks and fast food drive thrus running between every town and city, even more so than at present!
 
 
I may be misunderstanding the UK's laws, but wouldn't they have been better off to break into someone's house when they went to get groceries and then claim to be squatters? At least, don't "squatters" have the right to stay regardless of what the property owner says?

Squatters can be easily evicted with obligatory police assistance by any homeowner who's normal residential property has been invaded. Any concept of squatter's rights (not really true, you don't have a right to squat, it's just not criminalised in most circumstances) does not extend to residential property.
 
 
OK, guys, this has been a big story lately in England.

I've got my own take on it which is (as per usual LOL!) NOT the popular one.

First off, like you might be able to figure out from my monaker, I'm a gypsy.

A REAL gypsy, a Romani, not a jenisher like the travellers.

Over the years I've got well narked because the way the media can't tell the difference between us Roma and the jenishers.

Anyhow, that's by the way.

I'm anything BUT a fan of the travellers usually because they don't follow the law of the brothers like we do and do a lot of stuff that's dead against the Romani way.

Even so, I'm on their side when it comes to this business.

The Dale Farm residents are NOT squatters; they OWN the land.

For what it's worth both the High Court and the Court of Appeal ruled that Basildon Council had "discriminated unlawfully against the travellers."

By me, they're heroes standing up for their rights against tyranny and oppression.

An unjust law HAS to be form.

It's gonna cost at least 10 million to evict these people; the official printed material by the bailliffs includes racist remarks; the council deliberately SQUASHED a compromise proposal because they WANT confrontation.

I'm proud to be a Roma rather than a jenisher but that doesn't mean I don't feel for these guys.

One of them is an elderly woman in very poor health.

The bailliffs have already indicated privately that they're going to use violence.

If only the gadges would understand that THEY need to make compromises as well as the travelling community.

Over the last fifty years almost all the previous legal protection for travellers have been ripped away in Britain.

It's almost as bad here now as it is in Eastern Europe or as it was under the Nazis when they actually murdered our people in Auschwitz and other places.

One of the things that makes a society civilised is how it treats minorities.
 
 
Everyone else has to obey planning regulations, and so should the gypos. They have being causing noise and mayhem for the local residents, and the sooner that they are evicted, the better!
 
 
 
Deport them to where? Ireland?

 

Apart from the moral bankruptcy of ethnic cleansing, Ireland and the UK are both (God help us - I wish we weren't!) members of the EU.

As such, you can no more deport the Irish than you can the French, Spanish, Greeks, Poles and any other national of an EU member state.

It's a bit like suggesting deporting Texans to California!

Listen, pal, in the first place the rich and corporations regularly disobey planning regulations and get away with it.

Gypos? Christ, you can't even SPELL properly when you're insulting my people.

Gyppos is the right way to spell it (gippos is also technically correct).

Anyhow, the Dale Farm mob are NOT gypsies; they're travellers (what us Roma - the REAL gypsies - call jenishers or even - if we want to be REALLY insulting - puyurija gadge).

Even if they WERE gypsies, why do you think it's any more acceptable to trash them as gyppos than it would be to trash Jews as kikes or yids, blacks as ******* or sambos, Asians as Pakis, and so on?

Get a grip, mush!

Don't go making with the racist insults!
 
 
Well if they're travellers, not gypsies, how could that be racially insulting? Travellers, unlike gypsies aren't a race.

Regardless of what they are they should follow the regulations or be punished.

Interestingly, they technically are. They are defined as one on all Irish forms- census, passport, job applications etc. 'Please circle nationality' Irish. Irish Traveller. British. Other'

I'd say that's more for statistical and governance purposes, as they all follow a similar way of life and therefore are more likely to need certain services than the mainstream population. I wouldn't call them a 'race' in the truest sense of the word.
 
 
Get them out, I actually hate pikeys, they're worse than benefit thieves because they don't even pay taxes in the first place, but still get access to the NHS etc, as well as being a bunch of criminals, layabouts and thugs.

Oh shut up.

I don't give a damn what sect of the traveller community they are, they are criminals, breaking the law, and they should therefore be evicted, end of story.
 
 
I'm sure you wouldn't want pikeys building ghettos in your neighborhood. We had a bunch living in a field next to us for about a year (until they were forcibly removed by the council) - every single house in our hamlet was burgled within six months of their arrival and they just dumped their rubbish everywhere.
 
 
 
More & better education = better life.

 

Wrong! It simply means a greater chance to possess more money. Those things do not equal a better life and actually, to my mind, make life far worse.

Well then you are just wrong.

Obviously we are looking at 'averages'. But a person who comes out of university, gets a nice stable job etc will have a better employment life.. be able to afford more, go nice places, not worry so much about money etc and thus a better life in general, than someone who say.. dropped out at A-levels.

How can anyone think more education makes someones life worse?

Seriously. In the town I grew up a bunch (these families were like, semi travellers, or some ****) would turn up every so often, camp up in stupid ****ing places (once they barricaded themselves in my school with a bulldozer) and then ****ing rob as many houses as they could get away with. For a while one of the kids was in my class and he always boasted about what his family had stolen.

I had the great satisfaction of getting into a fight with him and completely dominating him. I miss year 10.

And regarding the top of this thread, I also find it kinda... Not annoying, but sorta wrong when people label travelers in general as Gypsies.
 
 
I feel sorry for the children, they are clearly being used as bait for the cameras. Also, if these elderly and sick people are as bad as they are saying they are, they should be getting proper medical treatment in a hospital.

I said, could be worse. I just think it's the height of folly to focus merely on the material. Quite frankly I'd rather be a poor person 100 years ago, when they had little material wealth, than poor person today because although they have more material wealth they are far worse, far more unhappy for it.

I suppose it will give those traveller women time to act as decoys, while their slaves are loaded into their vans, trucks and caravans, to be taken to work at their next site?

If travellers are a "persecuted ethnic group" what does that make their slaves, who they use as unpaid skivvies and childminders? As their slaves are invisible, the police and bailiffs aren't going to notice anything, are they?
 
 
In the first place, there NOT gypsies. I'M a gypsy - a Romani.

They're Irish travellers - we call them "jenishers"

Secondly, breaking the law is a long and honourable tradition in Britain!

Christ, we've got few enough freedoms as it is - we'd have even LESS if we hadn't rioted and had civil wars and stuff like that!
 
 
Pikey is even MORE insulting than gyppo.

Pikey is a Romani term for a gypsy who's been expelled from the tribe.

Imperial maniac, if you tried substituting words like "yid," "kike," "wog," "******" or "paki" for "gyppo" and "pikey" maybe you'd realise how pathetic your racist insults are.

Look, mate, MOST Romanies and even MOST Irish travellers DO pay taxes (including council tax.)

They also OWN the land.

The NHS is available to Eastern Europeans and Uncle Tom Cobblers and all. Why should you single out ONE ethnic group NOT to be allowed its services?

Are you a BNP supporter or what?

As the "slaves" don't exist; as most of them DENY that they WERE slaves; as these "slaves" were PAID good money; as they were nearly all homeless and alkies so would probably have been dead by now; I'd say they done them a favour.

It's like the Satanic ritual abuse bull**** back in the 80s and 90s when mad social workers stole kids from parents because of a load of *******s.

This is the same heap of khul!

Not for long in England, the law is being changed, and as for Scotland Wales?...anyway Scotland for sure it is already illegal to squat.

Problem is Travellers most defining feature is common criminality and total lack of respect for property laws and the law of the land.

Modern Britain relies on the rights of individuals and groups to their property.

Irish Travellers do not respect these rights.

In many cases they don't even travel (as the long term settlement of the Dale Farm travellers shows).

Fact is they are fully capable of legal and legitimate work and settlement like anyone else but they chose to defy the law and live outside it because they get welfare hand-outs and other expendable income without taxes by hiding behind the 'culture' label.

If it is a culture it is a detrimental parasitic one and not all cultures are born equal.

Fact is the Irish Travellers are going to have to adapt or get used to evictions because a sedentary society of multi-millions isn't going to do away with property rights just for them (and they wouldn't want that anyway, they survive off of that society).

YouGov poll shows two thirds of people support Dale Farm eviction

TWO thirds of the British public support Basildon Councilâs plans to evict travellers from Dale Farm.

66 per cent of people surveyed in a YouGov poll of 2,468 residents said they feel the council is right to try and evict the travellers from the illegal site.

17 per cent disagree and feel the council is wrong to do so.

The survey was carried between September 19 and 20 this year.

Older people are more likely to support the eviction, with 74 per cent of respondents over 60 agreeing compared to 59 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds.

Conservative supporters are the most likely to support eviction, with 82 per cent thinking the council is right compared to 66 per cent of Liberal Democrat supporters.

Because leaving school at 14 and working 10 hours in a factory earning minimum = the high life.

Typical ungrateful middle class ****.

How ridiculous. The council doesn't need to comprimise with people acting illegally. When did you last hear of police telling a serial killer "oh ok, we'll compromise - you stop killing people and we'll give you Â£50k"?

These people have been offered every chance in the world:
The council is offering houses There are legal pitches available Some own houses back in Ireland They have been given a huge amount of notice by the authorities Vast amounts of planning has gone into clearing the site safely (hence the massive cost)
That's "oppression"? You are honestly drawing comparisons with the Nazis?   Oh yes, I distinctly remember Hitler's famous insistence that his concentration camp victims were given full legal representation...

These people are giving the honest taxpayer the runaround at a time when the deficit is being cut and cancer patients are being refused lifesaving drugs on the NHS because they cost too much.

There are certain limits to which you must conform if you want to be part of British society. These people have chosen an anti-social way of life which is outlawed by a law NOT specifically designed to target minorities. They should take advantage of some of the MANY alternatives they have been offered, and I sincerely hope that those with assets are pursued for legal costs.

It's not everything, but when you're struggling to pay rent, or relying on benefits, it's pretty ****ing hard to call that a 'better life'. I think you should be grateful for the opportunities you have.

Why do you think people from other countries come to Britain? They don't come for the weather, they come because they want a better standard of life, where they don't have to worry about how much meat they can afford this month, or whether they can afford a school uniform for their kids.

You're right that money doesn't buy happiness, but what it certainly does buy is comfort. Try being happy when your electricity gets shut off because you can't afford the bill.

I think maybe you misunderstood what I was saying initially.

You're right, it's a bloody piss take.

They want to live by their own rules, and they've got shirty now that someone suggests they have to do the same as everyone else.

One law for everyone?
 
 
My experience of travellers in south Leicestershire was that they were violent and criminal. I'll be posting links from the local newspaper, the Harborough Mail, of reports of their criminality over the last few years when I get round to it. This is just one rural market town, the story is repeated all across the country.

I'm 100% behind Basildon District Council.
