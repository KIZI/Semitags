Pffft - typical west Ham. They field a team with zero players and still win.

Ben could probably explain this phenomenon in gambling terms, something to
do with negative expectation of Bristol Rovers players or whatever,
therefore the more they outnumber you the greater your chances.  Something
like that anyway.  Teh Hammers just spotted a good deal and went with the
odds.

In reality, any team could have done it, and Bristol Rovers will be kicking
themselves tonight that they didn't think of it themselves.

Their approach was totally results-based and they paid the price.

Do us all a favour that get on here will ya!, stop posting robotic reports
like you do. Were not thick, and I'm sure we are all adult enough to grasp
the likes of TV and Radio reports.

Stop it mate or you will get kill filed.

Mel.
