Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co., the largest U.S. metal service center, is seeking
"noticeable" acquisitions and hopes an improving economy leads to purchases in
the second half, Chief Executive Officer David Hannah said.

If a metals-service center with $2 billion in sales were available, Reliance
would "like to get involved," Hannah said by telephone from company headquarters
in Los Angeles. There are "not a lot" of companies that large, and there are
more in the range of $500 million to $800 million in sales that could be
targets, he said.

"The bigger the better," Hannah said in an interview Wednesday. "It's a lot of
work to do these things and you like it to be noticeable when you're done."

Reliance has completed about 45 acquisitions since its initial public offering
in 1994, a key component in boosting sales to $5.32 billion last year, from $447
million when the company went public. Such purchases are part of the company's
"primary business strategy," along with expansion of its existing operations,
according to Reliance's Web site.

"Reliance Steel has been a consolidator in the industry and we would anticipate
a return to acquisition activity later in the year," Yvonne Varano, a New York-
based analyst with Jefferies & Co., wrote in a Feb. 19 report. "We believe the
company is in a position of strength to leverage the balance sheet in order to
pursue growth opportunities."

Varano said such activity probably won't pick up until the second half of the
year. She rates the shares "buy" and doesn't own any.

The average value of Reliance's acquisitions has been about $195 million,
according to Bloomberg data. Hannah hasn't made a purchase since September 2008,
after which Reliance put acquisitions on hold as the global economic recession
cut steel demand. Hannah's largest purchase to date was PNA Group Holding Corp.
for $1.1 billion in August 2008.

Service centers don't make metal; they buy it from mills and then cut and shape
it into items from aircraft landing gear to car and tractor parts.

There is still "a lot more consolidation" to be done in the fragmented industry
where Reliance is the largest U.S. service center by sales, with less than 8
percent of the $153 billion market, Hannah said. He joined the company as chief
financial officer in May 1981 and was involved in its initial public offering in
that role. He became chief executive in January 1999.

Reliance will look at "all opportunities," Hannah said. One of the company's
specific interests is adding a nonferrous business or stainless-steel processor
in the southeastern United States, he said.

Historically, Reliance has paid four-to-five-times earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization "for well-managed companies that diversify
geography, metal form, and/or end market," Mark Parr, a Cleveland-based analyst
at KeyBanc Capital Markets, wrote in a Feb. 19 report.

When Reliance resumes acquisitions, the company probably will target prices at
"the very low end" of that historical range, given the "structural change" which
has resulted in lower demand for metal products, Hannah said.

The timing of acquisitions will be determined by sellers, Hannah said.

"We are getting closer to the time when service-center companies would be more
willing to think about selling their business," he said. "We are ready. We've
got the balance sheet to support it, the liquidity and the borrowing capacity."
