SEC opponent has yet to be determined.

Well, whoever it is will roll.  Wisconsin can't handle SEC speed.

Hopefully that means Auburn will be in the Peach^H^H^H^H^HChik-Fil-A
Bowl.  Not that I've got anything against playing Wisky, but it seems
to have been a frequent matchup over the past four or five years. I'd
rather change it up and play an ACC team.

The ceremony of innocence is drowned.
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity."

I heard it was the loser of the SEC Championship Game.  Florida is
going to the Capitol One.

I'm sorry...I guess Florida is going there only if they can get a ZOOK
match up.  Otherwise they might be going to the Outback.

The Badgers will be big underdogs w/ whoever they play, but I do VIVIDLY
remember Jack Ikegwuanu of Wisconsin running down and catching Darren
McFadden in the bowl game last year.

And no, he did not have a pursuit angle either. Saved a TD and Badgers won.

Yeah, I agree. The games have been pretty close but all of them pretty ugly
IIRC. I think they've played 3x in the past few years.

I think Florida would probably kill the Badgers... mostly because UW can't
stop the spread at all. However, if they (UW) are going to be underdogs
anyway, I'd rather see them take a shot at the Gators.

Probably the match up with the greatest upside for them, and they'd most
likely do better than tOSU did last year.

???  If it's tennessee, the badgers might be a small favorite(this is
the same tennessee team that got blown bout by cal and alabama, and
came within 3 inches of losing to vandy).

If it's auburn, auburn will be small favorite.

If it's florida, florida would be a significant(around 8 pts)
favorite.

So no, "whoever it is" wont be a big fave.  Last year against arkansas
is was basically a pickem(like a 1 oe 1.5 pt line at kickoff or
something)

, but I do VIVIDLY
