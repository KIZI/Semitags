 
 
Another misleading Daily Mail article regarding muslims
 
 
Here is the link to the article:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...y-reveals.html 

The headline states that ‘More than two thirds of young British Muslims believe 'honour' violence is acceptable, survey reveals.’ The first line of the article then claims that ‘Most young British Muslims support violence against women who 'dishonour' their families, a Panorama investigation will claim today.’

However if you then go on to read the entire article, you will discover that the poll surveyed British Asians, approximately half of whom are Hindus and Sikhs. Yet this fact is something the article tries to conveniently gloss over, instead targeting just Muslims in it’s emotive headline and throughout the rest of the article. The reason why all British Asians were polled in the study is because the issue of honour killings is rooted within south asian culture as a whole, it does not stem from any religion, all three of which strictly forbid it and equate it to murder.

The second important point to mention lies in the statement that ‘more than two thirds of muslims believe in honour violence.’ Yet on closer inspection you realise that this figure corresponds to the number of British Asians who believe in the concept of ‘honour’ in family life, only 18% actually said that violence was justified if this code was broken and the family ‘shamed’, of which a further 6% would endorse murder.

I find it incredible how such a popular online newspaper can get away with such blatant lies. It isn’t the first time the Mail has done such a thing, where they take a serious issue that needs to be tackled and twist it to meet their own bigoted agenda. Some of you might say ‘Why bother, just ignore it’, but the uncomfortable truth is that many people regard the DM as a credible news source. Some would just read the headline and immediately pass judgement whilst others might not even pick up on the fact that not all Asians are muslims. And I also know that someone on TSR is frothing at the mouth, and in the not too distant future will invariably refer to the article to bash islam and muslims. That’s not to say that there aren’t any muslims who would justify honour killings, instead I’m trying to point out how the skewed article paints a picture that is in stark contrast to actual reality. It’s just not the DM either, many other supposedly ‘credible’ outlets of news make use of the same sort of bias, especially when it comes to muslims.

On the topic of honour killings itself, it’s something that must be seriously addressed in all cultures in which its prevalent, as it is a disgusting and barbaric practice which involves no honour at all. Although the poll suggests that only a small minority of British Asians (18%) would resort to violence to defend their ‘honour’, this is still far too many, and we have to try to completely eradicate this backward mindset.
 
 
As a muslim, I believe in 'honour' but not 'honour violence.' If I had children, they should already know what the can or cannot do. I have a sister who is still a virgin at 22. She is staying like that on her own accord because she knows that as a muslim, she can't have sex outside marriage or have a child out of wedlock. She knows her responsibilities and she knows that is 'honour.'
 
 
that is ridiculous.

Are you sure? I went to school with a fair few Muslim girls, most took off their hijabs as soon as they were 100 metres away from their home. Lots met up with boys under the pretence that they were meeting up with female friends, many of which have boyfriends. They would meet in restaurants and request a seat right at the back, behind a pillar if possibly. Most lost their virginity before sixth form, yet their parents thought they were innocent little girls who only knew males within their own family. They'd pop their hijab on before they got home with stories of shopping and playing with make up.

Due to the sheer number of muslims I know who have done the above, it would seem to me that the honour thing is outdated and unnecessary. Sex outside of marriage really isn't a big thing, nor is meeting up with boys etc. Sex and curiosity are human nature, and in so many ways Islam goes against that - circumcision of girls and boys, fasting twice a year (seriously never seen so many pissed off and bitchy muslims than when they're fasting...), making women cover up in extreme temperatures etc etc.

All the muslims I know believed in God and prayed in their own way. Shouldn't that be enough? Religion is a PART of your life, not the whole damn thing. The same goes for any other religion.
 
 
 
Cool story bro.

Quite frankly I'm sick and tired of these Muslim related articles in the papers, however I hate these stupid threads that don't do anything besides create a stupid argument. They can get away with it because they can say whatever they want to do.

 

Well I'm just as sick as you about the constant attention muslims get in the media. However you know just as well as I do that somebody who has misinterpreted the article will inevitably create a thread on here targeting muslims. It's better that I pre-emptively clarify the truth behind this survey before someone brings forward the distortions from the article, because it will just lead to more trouble.

Also it may be apparent to you, but not everyone can see through such articles, some people take them at face value and this builds up prejudice. For me the inherent bias in some parts of the media is an important point to make, because it concerns my religion and how some people view me and others who share my faith. Regardless, if ANY group is unfairly targeted by an influential institution, it is down to individuals to speak up and state the truth wherever and whenever they can.
 
 
 
What else do you expect from the moon god folk?

 

If you actually read what he posted you would see that only 6%, a statistically insignificant amount, actually support murder. Exactly the kind of blind faith I would expect from someone who worships the false son of God.

To me though however, the honor system that runs through Islamic families is fundamentally flawed in ways, yet I do agree with the need for a sense of family pride. However, even those 18% that say violence is acceptable is not the full picture, not many people will blatantly tell a paper that they might beat their children if they dishonor the family.
 
 
Read the BBC article I've linked below and compare it to the Daily Mail article. It backs up all of the points the OP made.

Ok first of all the poll was conducted by BBC Panorama, not a paper. And they asked ALL asians about the issue, not just 'Islamic families'. The issue about how many reveal their true intentions is something that is a problem with every poll that is conducted, I have certainly never met an asian who supports the concept of honour killing so it's never occurred to me to be a widespread issue.

The post above makes a good point with the BBC article, you can see the differences for yourself.
 
 
The Daily Mail hates everybody. I'm surprised people still read it tbh, they alienate everybody at some point and is full of hypocrisy.

You may say Religion is a PART of your life and I respect that but for Muslims, Islam is a WAY OF LIFE. By the way its true about the girls meeting up with boys, taking off their hijabs etc but they don't really represent the religion so I don't know why your using them as an example.
 
 
Dude, shut up you're just trying to start arguments and debates. NOBODY CARES, everyone can see for themselves whether or not something is racist. We don't need reminding. Again, NOBODY CARES, we have eyes of our own.
 
 
The Daily Mail is a joke.

What is there to argue about? I am pointing out factual inaccuracies in the article so that others can see. Have a look at the comments on the actual DM article to see how oblivious most of the commentators are. And perhaps if you put your eyes to better use you would notice that this isn't a racial issue at all. Don't post if you have nothing constructive to say.

Well done at trying to make yourself sound smarter than me  
It's obvious that anything to do with religoin ends up in debate, so stop trolling. All I see on TSR is stuff about racism, islam, other religions, etc etc.
I'm not gonna use fancy words with you to make myself look like a deep-thoughted genius. Just shut up and stop trolling.

Well, actually they're pretty kind towards middle class white xenophobic heterosexual Christian fundamentalists between the ages 35 and 65 who have IQs in the double digits and were born in the UK to parents who also were.

I've seen the odd article having a go at the middle class, but yes, they are often sympathetic towards the people that have had to give up their maid and 3rd car in the economic downturn  

You summed it up quite nicely though

Well sounding smarter than you wasn’t exactly hard was it?  
In spite of what you think, continuously propagating disingenuous information on a group of people has a real effect in the real world. I’ve ignored it in the past but you have to make a stand at some point. I wouldn’t be wasting my time posting if I didn’t think it was important.

Btw they have reverted back to the original headline and article they had early this morning, where they referred to Asians as opposed to muslims. But they knew what they were doing, trying to stir up hatred during their hours of peak readership. Deliberate and cunning tactics from the best in the business.

Daily mail arnt the most scientific bunch- it wasnt ALL asians surveys- the sample was just 500. but they are joining the dots to get the picture - in that most of the honour killing in this country have been involving muslims families. i have read of one sikh case, no cases of, christian or buddhist.

There have also been cases of non-asian (but still muslim) iraqui, turkish and even east european and somalian muslim honour killings.
 
 
Honour killings occur within all the religions in South East Asia and even though worng, it is seen as ok. I think the problem is that it this practise has been brought over by Muslims from their countries to the UK and here it is very wrong. Another problem is that it is being called 'honour killing', there is nothing honourable about it,it is down right murder.
 
 
One of the many benefits of multiculturalism, I s'pose.
 
 
These people ought to be re-educated until they drop their primitive cultures. That is if they wish to live in the civilised world
 
 
The mail unfortunately represents the right these days, it used to be the telegraph, a much more legitimate and respected paper, infact, the most respected broadsheet in the UK if you look at awards, aside from The Times of course.

youre wrong becuase other south asian religions allow marriage outside the religion, which is practiced in the uk i beleive, so honour killings dont occur becuase of those religons.
islam does not allow women to marry men of another religion at all, or to even be seen to mix with them and families see it better to kill daughters than allow it to happen.

So I'm not wrong, we agree that honour killings happen because of the Islamic culture. You said it in your own words 'families see it better to kill daughters'.
 
 
 
If you actually read what he posted you would see that only 6%, a statistically insignificant amount, actually support murder. Exactly the kind of blind faith I would expect from someone who worships the false son of God.

 

even just 6% out of around 2,500,000 South Asians in the UK means that about 150,000 persons approve of murder in the case of a "honour killing"

if this is correct, it is not very reassuring. There is still a lot of work to do there.
 
 
 
So I'm not wrong, we agree that honour killings happen because of the Islamic culture. You said it in your own words 'families see it better to kill daughters'.

 

no actually you couldnt be more wrong. you said it was because of south asian religions. it isnt.
 
 
 
no actually you couldnt be more wrong. you said it was because of south asian religions. it isnt.

 

Then please tell me what is the course of these murders. If its not the religion or culture then what do you believe it is?
 
 
What's not to believe I don't get it  
 
 
 
Then please tell me what is the course of these murders. If its not the religion or culture then what do you believe it is?

 

its partly due to islam ( which is a middle eastern religion), partly due to families not integrating into uk society (which is again becuase they are ghettoised by local councils to living only amoung each other, as well as whte british people moving out as soon as they move into communities) and partly because, well some people are jsut nasty arnt they? Do you look for umbrella explanations for every murder that happens in the uk?

Well the truth is that they are sinning....especially when they know it, it's even worse from a religions point of view. Not all Muslim's are like that, a minority.

It's not enough, because it would make the faith pointless and meaningless.....the whole point of faith, is to follow it the best they can, which means dedication and sticking to the rules otherwise how can you follow a faith where you pick and choose which rules you wanna follow. Plus their are guidelines on how to pray in Islam, if you don't stick within the boundary and start bring in new things which a person believes counts as prayer......then it's no longer a prayer in Islam.

Your opinion is that religion is a part of your life.You can follow it all the time,but that doesn't mean you can't live your life. You aren't restricted, you have the obligated things which take a small amount of your daily time, then you have optional things which you can choose to do.
 
 
There are four kinds of lies; lie, damn lies, statistics and the bullsh1t that papers like the DM make up.

If you don't like what they say, don't read the newspaper... simples...
 
 
is 18% really a small number?

thats 1 in 5. thats like one person in every muslim household who agrees with 'honor' violence.
 
 
 
16-18.

 

Oh that's fine then. I thought you meant year 6's O_o

Stupid of me.
 
 
The Daily Mail is full of ****.

I know that, you know that, everybody knows that.

The post above makes a good point with the BBC article, you can see the differences for yourself.

 

But we know that the BBC were trying to highlight Islamic families.
 
 
It irritates me that the UK is expected to tolerate these savages. They should be forced out.
 
 
How come Al-Mail mention 'Muslims' instead of 'Asians' (specifically Subcontiental ones?) in their headline?

Very strange (and suspicious).
 
 
 
If you actually read what he posted you would see that only 6%, a statistically insignificant amount, actually support murder. Exactly the kind of blind faith I would expect from someone who worships the false son of God.

 

That's still quite a large minority. I don't think 6% of the overall population are murderers.

I don't understand the logic of this.

Surely it is easier just to disown the daughter (and persuade her to change her surname, and maybe forename) and stipulate that she ideally not come within a 50 mile radius of the immediate family.

Were the parents/relatives to do this, whilst being quite callous, it would not actually be illegal.

If they actually kill their daughter, there is absolutely no way they would be acquitted or be able to escape a conviction.

It makes no sense. These people must be very brainwashed, bloodthirsty, or generally quite stupid.

There is no logic to understand, we are not talking about logical people, what is the logic about forbidding your family to eat pork for example?- this is all about perceived standing within your own community/ In islamic communities if the story got out your daughter married a 'kaffr', your life wouldnt be living (in their eyes). And it would get out - in such insular communities where everyone knows eveyones business and talk to each other at mosque etc and judge how islamic each other are being. To a lessor extent - islam does allow for some physical violence to be directed from the father toward wives and duaghters ( so long as no marks are left) so there is sometimes a progression of that culture to an extreme in the case of a rebellious daughter that want to leave or marry outside islam.
 
 
 
that - circumcision of girls

 

Not allowed

 
fasting twice a year

 

Once a year

 
, making women cover up in extreme temperatures etc etc.

 

Not allowed to force women to cover up in any weather
 
 
 
All the muslims I know believed in God and prayed in their own way. Shouldn't that be enough? Religion is a PART of your life, not the whole damn thing. The same goes for any other religion.

 

I don't think you need to tell muslims how to follow their religion!!

Do they not realize that most of society doesn't care less about their daughter's activities?

Here is an article on an 'honour killer' after being arrested by Indian Police:  http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ho...father/925386/ 

There doesn't seem to be alot of motivation for the actual killing. In a city of 17 million people, nobody is really going to care less about some random woman's activities.

I still don't understand why they don't just disown the person in question and refuse to have any further contact (perfectly legal), or even move away to an undisclosed address (again perfectly legal).

Lots of people have friction in their families and just refuse to talk to each other - most of them don't feel the need to actually commit murder as a result.

I fail to see what it has to do with 'Islam' either. If it was related, surely most 1.5 billion of them would be engaged in a killing spree.
 
 
 
I don't think you need to tell muslims how to follow their religion!!

 

Yeah it's meant to be the other way round!

Cos a lot of people actually buy it and use it as factual information  
Not even jokin with that.

Differn reasoning aplies to different countries - this sort of thing hapens in places are far as south america to east asia. We are talking about UK cases.

Disowning your duaghter doesn realese a family from shame in the community does it, infact it heightens it. In islam apostasy is one of the greatest sins
Islam im sure doesnt encourage honour killings, of course not, but it allows violence against female family members if they dont follow instruction from the father/uncles etc. It also governs womens actions very strictly - so if they vere away form islamic rules, there is an allowance for thier 'punishment' in extreme cases this has led to murder.Equally in other countries governed by islamic law, beating your wife is allowable to an extent, and there is a lessor punishment for murdering a wife/daughter if it is shown she disobeyed the male - this right is enshrined in islamic law. Im sure it is failry common there, but not alwas classed as serious crime.
 
 
 
Yeah it's meant to be the other way round!

 

Such ignorance....not even sure where to start!

The reason why all British Asians were polled in the study is because the issue of honour killings is rooted within south asian culture as a whole, it does not stem from any religion, all three of which strictly forbid it and equate it to murder.

The second important point to mention lies in the statement that ‘more than two thirds of muslims believe in honour violence.’ Yet on closer inspection you realise that this figure corresponds to the number of British Asians who believe in the concept of ‘honour’ in family life, only 18% actually said that violence was justified if this code was broken and the family ‘shamed’, of which a further 6% would endorse murder.

I find it incredible how such a popular online newspaper can get away with such blatant lies. It isn’t the first time the Mail has done such a thing, where they take a serious issue that needs to be tackled and twist it to meet their own bigoted agenda. Some of you might say ‘Why bother, just ignore it’, but the uncomfortable truth is that many people regard the DM as a credible news source. Some would just read the headline and immediately pass judgement whilst others might not even pick up on the fact that not all Asians are muslims. And I also know that someone on TSR is frothing at the mouth, and in the not too distant future will invariably refer to the article to bash islam and muslims. That’s not to say that there aren’t any muslims who would justify honour killings, instead I’m trying to point out how the skewed article paints a picture that is in stark contrast to actual reality. It’s just not the DM either, many other supposedly ‘credible’ outlets of news make use of the same sort of bias, especially when it comes to muslims.

On the topic of honour killings itself, it’s something that must be seriously addressed in all cultures in which its prevalent, as it is a disgusting and barbaric practice which involves no honour at all. Although the poll suggests that only a small minority of British Asians (18%) would resort to violence to defend their ‘honour’, this is still far too many, and we have to try to completely eradicate this backward mindset.

 

if you read the article carefully it does not mention muslims at all other than a caption for the picture which states Honour attacks are punishments usually carried out against Muslim women, but it does not say any od the claims you say it does.

"More than two thirds of young British Muslims believe 'honour' " it does not say this sentence or anything alike at all in the article It actually says two thirds of ASIANS and not MUSLIMS.

Your calims are all wrong about this article
 
 
 
is 18% really a small number?

thats 1 in 5. thats like one person in every muslim household who agrees with 'honor' violence.

 

Because every Asian household is Muslim  
 
 
 
Such ignorance....not even sure where to start!

 

give it a shot.
 
 
 
Differn reasoning aplies to different countries - this sort of thing hapens in places are far as south america to east asia. We are talking about UK cases.

Disowning your duaghter doesn realese a family from shame in the community does it, infact it heightens it. In islam apostasy is one of the greatest sins
Islam im sure doesnt encourage honour killings, of course not, but it allows violence against female family members if they dont follow instruction from the father/uncles etc. It also governs womens actions very strictly - so if they vere away form islamic rules, there is an allowance for thier 'punishment' in extreme cases this has led to murder.Equally in other countries governed by islamic law, beating your wife is allowable to an extent, and there is a lessor punishment for murdering a wife/daughter if it is shown she disobeyed the male - this right is enshrined in islamic law. Im sure it is failry common there, but not alwas classed as serious crime.

 

Well, supposing someone kills their daughter - the police find out - they get arrested, get the story plastered all over the press, and then they get sentenced to death (whilst this is not permitted in the UK, in many nations it still is), surely that is the greatest form of shame?

What 'Islamic' law says is irrelevant - in a court in a secular country like India or the Netherlands, if the defendant says that he/she carried out his actions 'under the auspices of Islamic law', it is not going to count for anything.

I still fail to see why people would put this concept of 'honour' (itself subjective), above their freedom (which would be severely restricted if they engage in an honour killing).

I don't buy the 'shame in the community' excuse - since in a city/large town it is very easy to do things anonymously. For example, supposing I visit a prostitute tonight, how exactly would my colleagues find out unless they literally followed every one of my movements. Furthermore, unless I actually openly reveal my identity (forename and surnmae) in the middle of the Red Light District (with a loudspeaker), I don't think my employer would accuse me of 'bringing shame on them'. In light of how easily the issues can be avoided, I fail to see why actually killing someone is viewed as necessary.

I can debate with an intelligent person and may have a chance of winning, but debating with an ignorant person is a futile exercise. I would have to bring myself down to your level and then i would certainly lose since you have experience. So why bother!

i wasnt talking about netherlands or india their laws are similar to ours - in specifically islamic law run countires 'honour murders' of wives etc attract a lessor punishment than regular murders, they are deemd to be partially extenuating circumstances. So clearly there is something in islam that gices some legitimacy to violence toward female family, which in itself can lead to murder.

As to your view of 'shame' again logic is not applicable - the shame of killing your daughter because she wanted to leave islam, isnt (to them) the same as having a daughter that disobeyed you and ran off with a kaffr for eveyone to talk behind your back about. Its not logical, but then honour killing is not about logic.
 
 
It's true that the daily mail does this a lot with Muslims, but then it does that about lots of other people too. Immigrants, bankers, people who claim benefits etc.
That's just the style of the newspaper, isn't it? It's what you read when you want to find something to complain or be annoyed about.
 
 
wow i took part in this survey and i knew it would be used to spin some BS story
HOW DO THEY EVEN KNOW THE ONE ANSWERING THE PHONE WAS AN ASIAN?! THEY JUST CALLED up and said "hi we're are doing a survey'

have u seen the caption on the pic "Honour attacks are punishments usually carried out against Muslim women who have been accused of bringing shame on their family" WHAT WHAT WHAT ?! THE SURVEY WAS ON ASIANS NOT MUSLIMS
THE survey did ask what religion i identified myself with, funny how those stats aren't shown eh..... Maybe they wanna still spin the violent muslim line.........

Review some of the threads that you have started. I think you'll get all the answers you need from there.

You are another one of those persons who feels the need to impose the blame of his failings on someone else. Many people pick a scapegoat and stick with it. It is clear that you're scapegoat is muslims and asians.

Men have authority over women because God has made the one superior to the other, and because they spend their wealth to maintain them. Good women are obedient. They guard their unseen parts because God has guarded them. As for those whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and send them to beds apart and beat them. Then if they obey you, take no further action against them. Surely God is most high.
Qur'an 4:34

Along with that Surah theres a hadith where Muhammad hits wee Aisha.
 
 
What good did they do..??? By Going Against it.. Islam still is the fastest Growing religion..

AS Allah SWT says in Quran:-

THEY PLOT AND PLAN, AND Allah too PLANS; but the BEST of PLANNERS is Allah.
( سورة الأنفال, Al-Anfal, Chapter #8, Verse #30)

And INDEED (many) MESSENGERS WERE MOCKED at before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), but I GRANTED RESPITE to those who disbelieved, and finally I punished them. Then how (terrible) was MY punishment!
( سورة الرعد, Ar-Rad, Chapter #13, Verse #32)
Source(s):
Al Quran

BTW

Islam is the fastest growing religion in the West (where 99% anti-islamic media originated from Nevertheless, the West has many stereotypes and misconceptions about Islam that are due to the media, prejudice, and ignorance. Islam is often looked upon as a "extremist", "terrorist", or "fundamental" religion. Many people hate Islam and do not want to acknowledge its true teachings. In many cases, the media’s reports about Islam are incorrect due to ignorance. This is one of the reasons why the West often hates Islam. In contrast to what many Westerners think of Islam, Islam is a peaceful religion, which does not promote any forms of uncalled for fighting or "terrorist" actions.

No, if you read one of my later posts (at 13:36) you will see that I've mentioned the fact that they've changed the headline and article, from referring to muslims to referring to asians. I quoted the exact wording of the headline and first line of the article in my initial post when they exclusively cited muslims and made no mention at all about the other religions.

They ran with the muslim slanted story from around 8am to 1pm, prior to 8am they had pretty much the same headline and article they have now. Incidentally most of their readers are in that morning/midday timeslot, so they knew exactly what they were doing. They have an agenda, and they are prepared to use malicious tactics to achieve their goal.
 
 
 
Are you sure? I went to school with a fair few Muslim girls, most took off their hijabs as soon as they were 100 metres away from their home. Lots met up with boys under the pretence that they were meeting up with female friends, many of which have boyfriends. They would meet in restaurants and request a seat right at the back, behind a pillar if possibly. Most lost their virginity before sixth form, yet their parents thought they were innocent little girls who only knew males within their own family. They'd pop their hijab on before they got home with stories of shopping and playing with make up.

Due to the sheer number of muslims I know who have done the above, it would seem to me that the honour thing is outdated and unnecessary. Sex outside of marriage really isn't a big thing, nor is meeting up with boys etc. Sex and curiosity are human nature, and in so many ways Islam goes against that - circumcision of girls and boys, fasting twice a year (seriously never seen so many pissed off and bitchy muslims than when they're fasting...), making women cover up in extreme temperatures etc etc.

All the muslims I know believed in God and prayed in their own way. Shouldn't that be enough? Religion is a PART of your life, not the whole damn thing. The same goes for any other religion.

 

yo who the hell do you think you are to try and say such a thing about his sister. you may not have met the best Muslims but dont try and judge others in the perspective you percieved of Muslims from the girls at your school.thank you very much.
 
 
 
As a muslim, I believe in 'honour' but not 'honour violence.' If I had children, they should already know what the can or cannot do. I have a sister who is still a virgin at 22. She is staying like that on her own accord because she knows that as a muslim, she can't have sex outside marriage or have a child out of wedlock. She knows her responsibilities and she knows that is 'honour.'

 

It seems a bit odd that your Sisters sex life is your business.
 
 
Honor culture is immature and retrograde.

It doesn't do self-criticism or free inquiry. It says my team right or wrong.

It is anti-reason and anti-rational.

What it is is a very tight form of social solidarity based on a religious morality, it extracts such a high toll on the individual that it demands transgressors are severely punished in order to periodically refresh the group solidarity and the power of the religious morality over them.

Without the cathartic act of punishment it would kind of disappear as the group solidarity would never be refreshed.

So it goes hand in hand with punishment, it might not be violence but it could be emotional cruelty or some more subtle form of coercion.

It's obvious that anything to do with religoin ends up in debate, so stop trolling. All I see on TSR is stuff about racism, islam, other religions, etc etc.

 

You are, after all, browsing through the sub-forum titled "Religion".

You have only responded in that patronising tone regarding a topic which is completely irrelevant because you know I'm right but don't want to admit it. If you actually had something progressive and intellectual to say then you wouldn't seem like such a douche.

Not allowed

Once a year

Not allowed to force women to cover up in any weather

 

So you picked and chose which ones you deemed wrong and right? That still leaves a hell of a lot of things I have mentioned which are wrong. And yes, some things aren't allowed but some Muslims still do it (you aren't all so spiritual you don't sin).

I'm not the bad person for stating what I have observed. I have just met VERY few muslims who haven't regularly met up with boys, drunk alcohol, had sex, taken off their hijab when they got to school, eaten when they are meant to be fasting, to name a few. Most would also wear a full face of make up, the tightest jeans and dipping tops. And the boys weren't much better.

This is based on over 30 muslims I've come into contact with who are my age, in many different circumstances, so it's now like I've just happened to meet the bad ones.

Whereabouts do you live? When I went to school they would wear it all the time, some Muslim girls would wear it only for Ramadan and some wear make up with hijab but generally they were quite conservative and avoided contact with boys.

In contrast to what many Westerners think of Islam, Islam is a peaceful religion, which does not promote any forms of uncalled for fighting or "terrorist" actions.

 

Islam isn't hated per se by the West that is rubbish. I remember when I was back in school and university which was before 9/11, Islam was just another religion and had no perceived political agenda...it was just not really on the radar.

If somebody was 'a Muslim' it was kind of a private thing, just like if they were Jewish or Sikh or whatever....it never seemed to define them it totality like it does now, or perhaps it is Muslims who have sought to define themselves by their religion whereas it used to be incidental and not purposefully conspicuous.

Back before 9/11 it was very rare to see any Muslim women in the UK even wearing a Hijab let alone a Burka.

So I think you are quite wrong to have this victimhood narrative about 'the west' being against Islam for some imaginary reason.

It's always the same story isn't it? 'The west' is 'ignorant', is 'prejudiced' etc, the media is biased, everyone is against us?

As for it's 'true teaching' well Muslims cannot even agree what they are themselves, so you can hardly 'blame' 'the west' for not knowing.

As for Islam being a religion of peace it is clearly not, it was spread by war and conquest from the start as Muslim armies moved out from the Arabian peninsula...'the armed prophet' etc. Everywhere Islam is now (except the recent diaspora) is because it was conquered by Muslim armies, and they used various techniques to make people convert or got rid of the native population.

Now that does not mean Islam is a religion of violence either per se, I was just making a factual point about its history.

Now that does not mean Islam is a religion of violence either per se, I was just making a factual point about its history.

 

In a nation composed of people of disparate cultures and religious beliefs, a religious person takes his religious values into politics, but he keeps his religion out of it. Islam is not a political movement hence Islam never is on ''political radars''

First of all, it is necessary to define what we mean by violence. There are several dictionary definitions that can be taken into account such as 'swift and intense force', 'rough or injurious physical force or action', 'unjust or unwarranted exertion of force especially against the rights of others', rough or immediate vehemence' and finally 'injury resulting from the distortion of meaning or fact'. If these definitions are accepted for violence, then the question can be asked as to how Islam is related to these definitions?
The word Islam itself means peace and that the history of Islam has certainly not been witness to any more violence than one finds in other civilizations, particularly that of the West.
The peace that dominates the courtyard of a mosque or a garden whether it be in Marrakesh or Lahore is not accidental but the result of the control of force.You see one has to use force to establish peace whether those forces be natural, social or psychological.
In conclusion it must be emphasized that Islam directs controlling the use of force in the direction of creating equilibrium and harmony, limits it and opposes violence as aggression to the rights of both God and His creatures as defined by the divine Law.

what do you mean by that it is a simple fact that most people in the West who are not Muslim do not have much experience of Islam. How could they? The only information they get about Islam and Muslims is what they see on the television news, or in the newspaper. Newspapers, though, don’t run headlines about people trying to be good. The television news carries stories about explosions and wars and violence.

please do explain how an Islamic census showed that the wearing of hijab fell by a astonishing 74.23% that`s 46.2% being EU? and how the post-9/11 caused muslim women in EU and US to remove their culture of Burka wearing.

A wise man, (A.S.), says: “If people had known the advantages of acquiring knowledge they would have acquired it even if it had necessitated the shedding of their hearts’ blood or of their going down into the deep seas”.
There is no need to just make ''point'' if you don`t have enough knowledge regarding issue.You won`t go to school without a pen would you? That`s what i mean learn more before you talk nonsense<---- 4 calling me rubbish

This is providing you're telling the truth, which I doubt, since you do sound like the typical bigot.

I'm pretty sure you did have a rough childhood, possibly the estate you grew up in and the environment that surrounded you. Maybe you lived in parts of birmingham who knows. But, from what I've seen, and what I've heard from others, your statements are quite untrue.

It's comparable to Turkey I say. Conservatism, hijab observing etc. is said to have increased over the years (almost 70% or so observe it and this is in a country that has opposed the hijab for decades), i've noticed that in the UK aswell.

So, it's probably just your environment. I still hope you get counselling etc. You kow, talk about that phobia you have.

There are several dictionary definitions that can be taken into account such as 'swift and intense force', 'rough or injurious physical force or action', 'unjust or unwarranted exertion of force especially against the rights of others', rough or immediate vehemence' and finally 'injury resulting from the distortion of meaning or fact'. If these definitions are accepted for violence, then the question can be asked as to how Islam is related to these definitions?
The word Islam itself means peace and that the history of Islam has certainly not been witness to any more violence than one finds in other civilizations, particularly that of the West.
The peace that dominates the courtyard of a mosque or a garden whether it be in Marrakesh or Lahore is not accidental but the result of the control of force.You see one has to use force to establish peace whether those forces be natural, social or psychological.
In conclusion it must be emphasized that Islam directs controlling the use of force in the direction of creating equilibrium and harmony, limits it and opposes violence as aggression to the rights of both God and His creatures as defined by the divine Law.

 

I interpret that as you saying force or coercion in the name of Islam is good as it results in an Islamic peace...that is peace defined by (Islamic divine) law.

So Islamic force or coercion = good?

Other force or coercion = bad?

So if it is a religion of peace it is a conditional peace on Islamic terms.

You are right about it not being perhaps more violent in its total history that the West, but its origins are certainly more violent. The Christian church was never principally spread by the sword in Europe. Now in the present the Islamic world is typified by great sectarian and internecine violence.

 
what do you mean by that it is a simple fact that most people in the West who are not Muslim do not have much experience of Islam. How could they? The only information they get about Islam and Muslims is what they see on the television news, or in the newspaper. Newspapers, though, don’t run headlines about people trying to be good. The television news carries stories about explosions and wars and violence.

 

That applies to basically everything in the news.

 
please do explain how an Islamic census showed that the wearing of hijab fell by a astonishing 74.23% that`s 46.2% being EU? and how the post-9/11 caused muslim women in EU and US to remove their culture of Burka wearing.

 

Hmm I don't believe that. I am probably older than you are finished uni before 9/11. It was only after 9/11 you started really started seeing Muslim women demarcate themselves by wearing Hijabs etc. Before that is was very rare or non-existent. There was a few Muslim girls at my school and non wore a hijab, now all the muslim girls at the same school are conspicuously Muslim in dress.

It's paralleled in places like Turkey and Egypt also. The older generation of women adopted secular styles, it is their daughters who are 'born again Muslims' and wearing Hijabs and burkas etc.
 
 
 
This is providing you're telling the truth, which I doubt, since you do sound like the typical bigot.

I'm pretty sure you did have a rough childhood, possibly the estate you grew up in and the environment that surrounded you. Maybe you lived in parts of birmingham who knows. But, from what I've seen, and what I've heard from others, your statements are quite untrue.

It's comparable to Turkey I say. Conservatism, hijab observing etc. is said to have increased over the years (almost 70% or so observe it and this is in a country that has opposed the hijab for decades), i've noticed that in the UK aswell.

So, it's probably just your environment. I still hope you get counselling etc. You kow, talk about that phobia you have.

 

You're a horse with blinkers on. You can't see the truth. As such you're not worth my time writing a logical reply. People like you don't see logic, you just select what you wish to see. Everything else doesn't exist.
 
 
 
but I wanted to start an argument sooooo badly  

 

You should contribute more than just pure drivel if you wish to stir some fun.

  dude did you read what i said
 
 
 
  dude did you read what i said

 

Yep you said Islam needs to use forms of force to establish an Islamic peace.
 
 
 
As a muslim, I believe in 'honour' but not 'honour violence.' If I had children, they should already know what the can or cannot do. I have a sister who is still a virgin at 22. She is staying like that on her own accord because she knows that as a muslim, she can't have sex outside marriage or have a child out of wedlock. She knows her responsibilities and she knows that is 'honour.'

 

placing arbitrary restrictions on oneself is so honourable.
 
 
 
No, if you read one of my later posts (at 13:36) you will see that I've mentioned the fact that they've changed the headline and article, from referring to muslims to referring to asians. I quoted the exact wording of the headline and first line of the article in my initial post when they exclusively cited muslims and made no mention at all about the other religions.

They ran with the muslim slanted story from around 8am to 1pm, prior to 8am they had pretty much the same headline and article they have now. Incidentally most of their readers are in that morning/midday timeslot, so they knew exactly what they were doing. They have an agenda, and they are prepared to use malicious tactics to achieve their goal.

 

okay fair enough
 
 
Who cares?
 
 
 
You're a horse with blinkers on. You can't see the truth. As such you're not worth my time writing a logical reply. People like you don't see logic, you just select what you wish to see. Everything else doesn't exist.

 

That's an excellent comeback, no irony considering you said this;

 
Are you sure? I went to school with a fair few Muslim girls, most took off their hijabs as soon as they were 100 metres away from their home. Lots met up with boys under the pretence that they were meeting up with female friends, many of which have boyfriends. They would meet in restaurants and request a seat right at the back, behind a pillar if possibly. Most lost their virginity before sixth form, yet their parents thought they were innocent little girls who only knew males within their own family. They'd pop their hijab on before they got home with stories of shopping and playing with make up.

Due to the sheer number of muslims I know who have done the above, it would seem to me that the honour thing is outdated and unnecessary. Sex outside of marriage really isn't a big thing, nor is meeting up with boys etc. Sex and curiosity are human nature, and in so many ways Islam goes against that - circumcision of girls and boys, fasting twice a year (seriously never seen so many pissed off and bitchy muslims than when they're fasting...), making women cover up in extreme temperatures etc etc.

All the muslims I know believed in God and prayed in their own way. Shouldn't that be enough? Religion is a PART of your life, not the whole damn thing. The same goes for any other religion.

 

You lived in a small town where "bad" Muslims existed, that like yourself (minus the muslim part), smoked, fornicated, drugged and the rest of the things your culture entices in. And then, in a very narrow minded way, you imagined that to be true for Muslims in general. I think it's you who's only "seeing what they want". Granted we're not perfect, but we still maintain a higher standard of moral then you ever could.

You like to use the word "logic" yet your post is more to do with emotional reasoning than logic. You should know, "logic" doesn't matter when faced against fact.

 
CARDIFF – Muslims in the United Kingdom are actively practicing their faith and are passing on their religious teachings to their children at much higher rates than other religions, a new study has found.
“There is more involvement of Muslim young people in religious organizations,” says the study by the Cardiff University and cited by the BBC News Online on Tuesday, February 14.

“It is well known that there is considerable supplementary education for Muslim children such as the formal learning of the Qur'an in Arabic."

Studying the role of religion in the life of minority communities, the research, performed by Cardiff's School of Social Sciences and Center for the Study of Islam in the UK, found that Muslims are practicing their faith at higher rates than other religions.

It showed that 77% of adult Muslims in Britain actively practice the faith they were brought up in, compared with 29% of Christians and 65% of other religions.

It also found that 98% of Muslim children had the religion their parents were brought up in, compared to 62% of Christian children and 89% of other religions.

“The apparently much higher rates of intergenerational transmission in Muslims and members of other non-Christian non-Muslim religions are certainly worthy of further exploration and may in fact pose a challenge to blanket judgments about the decline of British religion,” the study said.

“These higher rates might suggest support for the theory that for minority ethnic populations, religion can be an important resource in bolstering a sense of cultural distinctiveness.”

The study analyzed data from the Home Office's 2003 Citizenship Survey, using 13,988 replies from adults and 1,278 from young people aged 11 to 15.

Britain is home to a sizable Muslim minority of nearly 2.5 million.

Religion Role

The study highlighted the growing role of religion in the life of minority communities, including British Muslims.

“Muslim children tend to lead busy lives, often attending religious education classes outside school three or more times each week on top of any other commitments they have,” Prof Jonathan Scourfield, one of the researchers who took part in the study, told the BBC.

“They typically learn to read the Qur'an in Arabic. They also learn a great deal about their faith from parents and other family members.

“Religion can have an especially important role for minority communities in keeping together the bonds between families from the same ethnic background.”

The study followed a recent research by Ipsos Mori that suggested Britons who declare themselves Christian display low levels of belief and practice.

Almost three quarters of the 1,136 people polled agreed that religion should not influence public policy, and 92% agreed the law should apply to everyone equally, regardless of their personal beliefs.

The survey was conducted for the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (UK), which describes itself as promoting “scientific education, rationalism and humanism”.

 Conflict, theology and history make Muslims more religious than others, experts say 

Conflict, theology and history make Muslims more religious than others, experts say

By Richard Allen Greene, CNN

(CNN) – Every religion has its true believers and its doubters, its pious and its pragmatists, but new evidence suggests that Muslims tend to be more committed to their faith than other believers.

Muslims are much more likely than Christians and Hindus to say that their own faith is the only true path to paradise, according to a recent global survey, and they are more inclined to say their religion is an important part of their daily lives.

Muslims also have a much greater tendency to say their religion motivates them to do good works, said the survey, released over the summer by Ipsos-Mori, a British research company that polls around the world.

Islam is the world's second-largest religion - behind Christianity and ahead of Hinduism, the third largest. With some 1.5 billion followers and rising, Islam's influence may be growing even faster than its numbers as the Arab Spring topples long-reigning secular rulers and opens the way to religiously inspired political parties.

The case against TLC’s “All-American Muslim”

But while there's no doubt about the importance of Islam, experts have different theories about why Muslims appear to be more religious than members of other global faiths - and contrasting views on whether to fear the depth of Muslims' commitment to their faith.

One explanation lies in current affairs, says Azyumardi Azra, an expert on Islam in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim majority country.

Many Muslims increasingly define themselves in contrast with what they see as the Christian West, says Azra, the director of the graduate school at the State Islamic University in Jakarta.

"When they confront the West that they perceive or misperceive as morally in decline, many Muslims feel that Islam is the best way of life. Islam for them is the only salvation," he says.

The case for TLC’s “All-American Muslim”

That feeling has become stronger since the September 11 attacks, as many Muslims believe there is a "growing conflict between Islam and the so-called West," he says.

"Unfortunately this growing attachment to Islam among Muslims in general has been used and abused by literal-minded Muslims and the jihadists for their own purposes," he says.

But other experts say that deep religious commitment doesn't necessarily lead to violence.

"Being more religious doesn't necessarily mean that they will become suicide bombers," says Ed Husain, a former radical Islamist who is now a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

In fact, Husain argues that religious upbringing "could be an antidote" to radicalism.

American Muslim women who cover explain their choice

The people most likely to become Islamist radicals, he says, are those who were raised without a religious education and came to Islam later, as "born-agains."

Muslims raised with a grounding in their religion are better able to resist the distortions of Islam peddled by recruiters to radical causes, some experts like Husain argue, making them less likely to turn to violence.

But he agrees that Muslims are strongly attached to their faith, and says the reason lies in the religion itself.

"Muslims have this mindset that we alone possess the final truth," Husain says.

Muslims believe "Jews and Christians went before us and Mohammed was the last prophet," says Husain, whose book "The Islamist" chronicles his experiences with radicals. "Our prophet aimed to nullify the message of the previous prophets."

The depth of the Muslim commitment to Islam is not only a matter of theology and current events, but of education and history, as well, other experts say.

"Where religion is linked into the state institutions, where religion is deeply ingrained from childhood, you are getting this feeling that 'My way is the only way,'" says Fiyaz Mughal, the director of Faith Matters, a conflict-resolution organization in London.

The Ipsos-Mori survey results included two countries with a strong link between religion and the state: Legally Muslim Saudi Arabia, which calls itself the guardian of Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina; and Indonesia, home of the world's largest Muslim population.

The third majority Muslim country in the study is Turkey, which has a very different relationship with religion. It was founded after World War I as a legally secular country. But despite generations of trying to separate mosque and state, Turkey is now governed by an Islam-inspired party, the AKP.

Turkey's experience shows how difficult it can be to untangle government and religion in Muslim majority countries and helps explain the Muslim commitment to their religion, says Azyumardi Azra, the Indonesia expert.

He notes that there has been no "Enlightenment" in Islam as there was in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, weakening the link between church and state in many Christian countries.

"Muslim communities have never experienced intense secularization that took place in Europe and the West in general," says Azra. "So Islam is still adhered to very strongly."

But it's not only the link between mosque and state in many Muslim majority countries that ties followers to their faith, says professor Akbar Ahmed, a former Pakistani diplomat who has written a book about Islam around the world.

Like Christians who wear "What Would Jesus Do?" bracelets, many Muslims feel a deep personal connection to the founder of their faith, the prophet Muhammad, he says.

Muhammad isn't simply a historical figure to them, but rather a personal inspiration to hundreds of millions of people around the world today.

"When a Muslim is fasting or is asked to give charity or behave in a certain way, he is constantly reminded of the example set by the prophet many centuries ago," argues Ahmed, the author of "Journey Into Islam: The Crisis of Globalization."

His book is based on interviews with Muslims around the world, and one thing he found wherever he traveled was admiration for Muhammad.

"One of the questions was, 'Who is your role model?' From Morocco to Indonesia, it was the prophet, the prophet, the prophet," says Ahmed, the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University in Washington.

But while Ahmed sees similar patterns across the Islamic world, Ed Husain, the former radical, said it was important to understand its diversity, as well.

"There is no monolithic religiosity - Muslims in Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are following different versions of Islam," says Husain. "All we're seeing (in the survey) is an adherence to a faith."

Political scientist Farid Senzai, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding in Washington, raised questions about the survey's findings.

"Look at the countries that are surveyed - Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Turkey," he says. "There are about 300 million Muslims in those three countries, (who make up) about 20% of Muslims globally."

Islam is "incredibly important" in Saudi Arabia, he says.

"But in Tunisia or Morocco you could have had a different result. It would have been nice if they had picked a few more Arab countries and had a bit more diversity," says Senzai.

The pollster, Ipsos-Mori, does monthly surveys in 24 countries, three of which are majority Muslim – Turkey, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. The other countries range from India to the United States, and Mexico to South Korea, and are the same each month, regardless of the subject the pollsters are investigating.

In the survey released in July, about six in 10 Muslims in the survey said their religion was the only way to salvation, while only a quarter of Hindus and two out of 10 Christians made that claim about their own faiths.

More than nine out of 10 Muslims said their faith was important in their lives, while the figure was 86% for Hindus and 66% for Christians.

Ipsos-Mori surveyed 18,473 adults via an online panel in April and released the findings in July. Results were weighted to make the results as representative as possible, but the pollster cautioned that because the survey was conducted online, it was harder to get representative results in poorer countries where internet access is not widespread.

CNN polling director Keating Holland also warns that in an "opt-in" survey, where respondents actively choose to participate, results tend to come from "people who are confident in their opinions and express them openly... not good for intensely private matters like faith or income or sex."

Online surveys in countries that are not entirely free are also open to the possibility that pollsters get "the approved response" in those nations, "where the people who are most likely to be willing to talk about such matters are the ones who hold, or at least verbalize, opinions that won't get them in trouble if they are expressed," Holland says.

That may have been an issue in Saudi Arabia, where respondents were given the choice of not answering questions on religion due to their potential sensitivity in the kingdom. The Saudi sample was the smallest, with 354 participants, meaning "findings for Saudi Arabia must be treated with caution," Ipsos-Mori said.

About 1,000 people participated in most countries, but sample sizes were smaller in the three majority Muslim countries and in eight other countries.

The survey participants did not reflect the true percentage of Christians and Muslims in the world. Christians were over-represented – as were people who said they had no religion – and Muslims were under-represented.

Nearly half the respondents identified themselves as Christian. Eleven percent were Muslim, 4% were Buddhist, 3% were Hindu and 3% were "other." A quarter said they had no religion and 6% refused to say.

Fiyaz Mughal, the interfaith expert, argues that even though the countries surveyed might not be representative of the entire Muslim world, the findings about Muslims rang broadly true. Muslims in different countries were committed to their faith for different reasons, he says.

"Saudi Arabia is an institutionally religious state. Indonesia has religion tied into its culture," says Mughal.

But Muslim immigrants to Europe also show strong ties to their religion, either as a defense mechanism in the face of a perceived threat, or because of an effort to cling to identity, he contends.

He detects a link between insular communities and commitment to faith regardless of what religion is involved. It is prevalent in Muslim Saudi Arabia, but he has seen it among Israeli Jews as well, he says.

"The Israeli Jewish perspective is that (the dispute with the Palestinians) is a conflict of land and religion which are integrally linked," Mughal says.

"What does play a role in that scenario is a sense of isolationism and seclusion in Israeli Jewish religious communities, a growing trend to say, 'Our way is the only way,'" he says.

Religious leaders of all faiths need to combat those kinds of attitudes because of the greater diversity people encounter in the world today, he argues.

They have a responsibility to teach their congregations "that if they are following a religion, it is not as brutal or exclusive as possible," Mughal says. "Things are changing. The world is a different place from what it was even 20 years ago."

Politicians, too, "need to take these issues quite seriously," he says.

"In the Middle East there are countries - the Saudi Arabias - where you need to be saying that diversity, while it may not be a part of the country, is something they have to deal with when moving in a globalized area," he says.

But Senzai, the political scientist, says that it's also important for the West to take the Muslim world on its own terms.

"Many Muslims want religion to play a role in politics," he says. "To assume that everyone around the world wants to be like the West - that they want liberal secular democracy - is an absurd idea."

we still maintain a higher standard of moral then you ever could.

As a muslim, I believe in 'honour' but not 'honour violence.' If I had children, they should already know what the can or cannot do. I have a sister who is still a virgin at 22. She is staying like that on her own accord because she knows that as a muslim, she can't have sex outside marriage or have a child out of wedlock. She knows her responsibilities and she knows that is 'honour.'

 

which would be fine if it was purely a religious obligation or due- it would mean she was adhering to a belief system that she consented to, and is complicit with.

The term 'honour' on the other hand is different- the term 'honour' does not have the clear confines detailed in religious scriptures. More often than not, it is a muddle between certain elements of religion, traditional culture, and very tribal familial structures that are much more to do with traditionalism than with religion itself. As a result, the term 'honour' is very much a tribal term, which is socially constructed by those who create it and maintain it's existence.

The fundamental difference, is that, in being born into say, a south asian family, you are born within a familial framework structured around the term 'honour'. There is little awareness of such a term, as many people in the family are unaware of what it is, while forcibly being bound to it- making it dangerous for all but the individuals who are the most powerful within the honour structure. More often than not, the obsession with chastity, female virginity etc, makes females the vanguards of honour, but also the most vulnerable, to men who automatically assume power in the honour structure on grounds of their lineage.

Which is why the term 'honour' needs to be criticised and destroyed as soon as possible. Because the reality is that in it's very nature, it lends itself as an extension of patriarchy and forcible compliance in a way that is involuntarily and not understood- there is of course, a moral case to this too, but im sure someone else will have explained that at some point in this thread.
