NBA star Dirk Nowitzki's former fiancee Crystal Taylor was transferred from a Texas jail to a lockup in Missouri on Tuesday.

Authorities said Taylor, arrested at Nowitzki's Dallas home in May, was taken to Missouri after posting bond in Jefferson County.

Taylor, 38, faces probation violation charges and a theft warrant in Missouri. She was charged with theft in Beaumont, Texas, for allegedly failing to pay for $10,000 worth of dental work in 2006.

Taylor has told The Dallas Morning News that she is pregnant with Nowitzki's child. Nowitzki has filed for custody if a paternity test proves he's the father.
