British Prime Minister David Cameron's office says the leader's wife has given birth to a baby girl while the couple was on their summer vacation.

In a statement, Cameron's office said Tuesday the baby was born in Cornwall, southwest England, where the family are spending their holiday.

Samantha Cameron had been expected to give birth in September, and arrangements were made for Cameron to take paternity leave next month.

The family have two other children. Another child, their severely disabled son, Ivan, died last year aged 6.

Cameron's office said Samantha and the baby were doing well, and offered thanks to the hospital staff.
