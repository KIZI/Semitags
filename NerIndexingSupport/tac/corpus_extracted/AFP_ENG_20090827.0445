Malaysian share prices closed up 0.37 percent Thursday in thin volume, dealers
said.

The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index gained 4.34 points to 1,176.90 with a volume of
585 million shares worth 1.00 billion ringgit (285.51 million dollars).

There were 292 gainers, 363 losers and 241 counters traded unchanged.

"The signals are rather mixed; so the stocks attracting greatest attention are
speculative plays and lower liners...large funds are probably still watching out
for a clearer market direction," a dealer told Dow Jones Newswires.

Decliners included state energy provider Tenaga which slipped 1.2 percent to
8.00 ringgit. Property group SunCity fell 2.9 percent to 3.30 ringgit.

On the upside, infrastructure investment group MMC Corp rose 5.7 percent to 2.42
ringgit while communications solutions provider Time DotCom climbed 7.8 percent
to 0.42 ringgit.
