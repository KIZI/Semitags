U.S. President Barack Obama announced on Friday that White House Chief of Staff
Rahm Emanuel would leave his job in Washington.

Emanuel's stepping down went into effect immediately after the announcement. He
is expected to run for mayor of Chicago.

"It is fair to say we could not have accomplished what we accomplished without
Rahm's leadership," Obama said at the White House. "He just brings an unmatched
level of energy and enthusiasm and commitment to every single thing that he
does."

Pete Rouse, Obama's chief of staff when he served in the U.S. Senate and
currently a senior advisor to the president, will serve as Emanuel's interim
replacement.

Neither Obama nor Emanuel made an explicit announcement that Emanuel will run
for mayor of Chicago. But there's no secret that the 50-year-old Chicago-born
Emanuel, who was a U.S. Representative from Illinois before he became White
House chief of staff, covets the Chicago mayorship. The current mayor, Richard
Daley, announced he's not running for reelection in 2011. His term ends May 16
next year.

"I'm energized by the prospect of new challenges, and eager to see what I can do
to make our hometown even greater," said Emanuel.

Emanuel is known for his strong and aggressive personality that has earned him
the nickname "Rahmbo." He is said to have sent a dead fish in a box to a
pollster who was late delivering polling results. While Rouse, who has worked on
Capitol Hill for more than 30 years, behaves in a more quiet and gentle style.

"Obviously these two men have slightly different styles," said Obama. "Pete has
never seen a microphone or a TV camera that he likes."

There has been several announcements of departure among top officials in the
Obama administration, including budget director Peter R. Orszag, who left in
late July, and economist Lawrence Summers, who will leave his post as director
of the National Economic Council at the end of the year.
