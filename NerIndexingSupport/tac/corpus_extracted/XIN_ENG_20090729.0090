Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman would attend the 32nd Meeting of the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) to review the political situation
in the Fiji Islands.

As Malaysia is holding the chair of CMAG for the year 2007-2009 term, Anifah
would chair the two-day meeting in London starting on July 30 and the meeting
would adopt a statement for Fiji at the end of the meeting on July 31,,
according to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday.

The ministry also said that the primary mandate of the CMAG was to deal with
serious or persistent violation of the Harare Principles contained in the 1991
Harare Declaration of the Commonwealth.

The members of CMAG are committed to Harare Principles regarding democracy,
independence of the judiciary, good governance, human rights and rule of law,
the ministry noted.

The current members of CMAG included Ghana, Malaysia, Namibia, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, St. Lucia, Sri Lanka, Uganda and Britain.

Fiji was suspended from the Councils of the Commonwealth for the second time by
the CMAG in December 2006, as a result of the military coup in the same year,
according to the ministry.
