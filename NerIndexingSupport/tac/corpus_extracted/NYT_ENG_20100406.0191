Timothy Cahill assembled a bipartisan team of advisers, including
former
staffers on Senator John McCain's presidential bids.

At least one of the four "McCainiacs" brought on board a month
ago by
state Treasurer Timothy P. Cahill to help guide his independent bid
for
governor is now out as an adviser to the campaign.

Mike Dennehy, a New Hampshire-based Republican political
consultant, told
the Globe yesterday that the Cahill campaign is not returning his
phone
calls and e-mails.

"I have not had any contact with the campaign since the
announcement,"
Dennehy, who grew up in Massachusetts, said in an interview. "They
obviously wanted a big 'McCainiacs support Tim Cahill' story, and
they got
it, but, in the end, it seems obvious they didn't want to pay for
any more
talent. I haven't had any returned calls or e-mails for some time.
A few
weeks ago, they basically said 'We'll be back in touch."'

Just weeks ago, Cahill's campaign announced with great fanfare
that Dennehy
- a senior adviser to US Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential
campaign
and key operative in the Granite State in McCain's 2000
presidential bid -
was coming aboard along with three other veterans of McCain
campaigns.

The four were to be part of a bipartisan consulting crew that
also
includes Democratic media consultants Tad Devine and Julian Mulvey.

The other McCain alums are John Yob, John Weaver, and Mark
Salter, who is
co-author of McCain's books.

Weaver, a former top strategist for McCain, praised Dennehy but
said there
were "redundancies" in the skills of the consulting team.

Both Dennehy and Yob specialize in tactics and identifying
independent and
conservative Democrats who are swing voters, he said, while Weaver
focuses
on strategic advice and Salter's forte is communications and
speech-writing.

"It's one of those things," said Weaver, who called the Globe
from a
Caribbean island where he is being married on Saturday.

"There was enthusiasm for all four of us but some of us do the
same things
.. But nobody's e-mails are not being returned, and the rest of us
are all
enthusiastically involved," he said. "I love Mike, and I wish him
well at
what he's doing.".

To date, the only record of payment made by Cahill's campaign to
the group
was $25,000 to Yob's Michigan-based Strategic National Consulting
on March
15.

That was 10 days after the announcement.

"There are different contracts," Weaver said. "I'm not going
to get into
who has the lead contract and who's subcontracting out. Everybody
who's
working actively is being paid."

Salter said yesterday he had done some work for the campaign but
referred
questions about his work and whether he has been paid to the Cahill
campaign.
