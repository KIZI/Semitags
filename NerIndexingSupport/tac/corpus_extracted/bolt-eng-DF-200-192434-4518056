 
 
The Hangover
 
 
I saw this for the first time a few days ago and quite enjoyed it.
To those that enjoyed it, what was your best part? What was your best quote?
 
 
Re-tard... so funny
or toodledoo mutha****er
 
 
I didn't like it too much as a whole, but I did realy like the scene where the guy is winnin' loads of money in the casino, an' all the sums are floating around  
 
 
'reTard'

and

'and my wolfpack, it grew by one. So there were two of us in the wolfpack'

and

'it's funny because he's fat!!'
 
 
When the Chinease jumps out the boot and knocks the other two out, then he turns to Alan and Alan says:

"Wait! I'm on your side too man. I hate Godzilla also."

LMFAO
 
 
Can I ask you another question?
Sure.
You probably get this a lot. This isn't the real Caesar's Palace is it?
What do you mean?
Did, umm... did Caesar live here?
No.
I didn't think so.
 
 
I love this film.

Next week's no good for me the Jonas Brothers are in town.
 
 
Ah I loved the movie. The last scene where all the photos taken last night are shown is epic  
 
 
'I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust'

Haha yeah :P Alan is just a leg end.

One of my favourite bits is definitely the Rain Man reference. Beautiful.
 
 
One of the best films ever.

'well maybe you should try tell that to rainman as he practically banrupted a casino and he was a re-tard'

'I hate Godzilla! I hate him too! I hate him! He destroys cities!'

and.....'tigers love pepper....they hate cinnamon'
 
 
"Toodaloo Mutha****aaaaaaaaaaaaa"

or

"How do you know tiger's like pepper? Tigers love pepper, they hate cinammon"

My favourite scene is probably where they see the footage in tyson's house the morning after
 
 
- I'll better leave.
- That's a good idea.
 
 
"what happens in vegas stays in vegas... ecept herpes, that **** will come back with you "
 
 
'Paging Dr Faggot...'

'DR FAGGOT'
 
 
towards the end after the girlfriend gets dumped

"suck my dick"

"no thankyou"
 
 
Really, really unfunny.
 
 
"HEY! there were skittles in there."
 
 
I was going to say the holocaust ring one, but seeing how that's been done,

Stu Price: 'We don't want to call attention to ourselves!'
Phil Wenneck: [while driving a squad car on the sidewalk and using the loudspeaker] 'Attention! Attention!'

And the Dr Faggot one is great comic timing/scripting.
 
 
My friends arent immature
calling Dr Fag"
 
 
I remember watching that film when it first came out at the cinemas. I was so down that day and that film really got me laughing all the way through. There're so many good bits but the one I can think of off the top of my head is at the beginning when the fat guy makes his speech and then proceeds to cut his hand.
 
 
~I always wondered why they were called roofies, 'cause you're more likely to end up on the floor than the roof. They should call 'em floories.
~Or rapies.

~Gambling? Who said anything about gambling? It's not gambling when you know you're gonna win. Counting cards is a foolproof system.
~It's also illegal.
~It's not illegal. It's frowned upon, like masturbating on an airplane.
~I'm pretty sure that's illegal too.
~Yeah, maybe after 9/11, where everybody got so sensitive. Thanks a lot, bin Laden.
 
 
I laughed my arse off! I wasn't expecting it to be that funny!

"Not at the table Carlos!"

Hmmm... I think I'm the only one who didn't care for this film.
 
 
Much better film than I was expecting actually. I'm not hot on all the immature lines that people are quoting, but I liked the way the story unfolded.  
 
 
is my hair classic phil?
 
 
I lovvved that film!

"Re-tard"
"Paging Doctor Faggot. Doctor Faggot!"  
"I look like a nerdy hillbilly!" with his tooth out
 
 
My favourite bit:

What do tigers dream of, when they take a little tiger snooze?
Do they dream of mauling zebras, or Halle Berry in her catwoman suit?
Don't you worry your pretty striped head
We're gonna get you back to Tyson and your cosy tiger bed
And then we're gonna find our best friend Doug
And then we're gonna give him a best friend hug
Doug, Doug oh Doug, Dougie Doug Doug.
And if he's been killed by chrystal meth tweakers...
... then we're sh*t outta luck
 
 
Policeman - "Come here handsome"

'Alan walks towards the policeman...'

Policeman - "Not you fat Jesus!!!"    
 
 
Absolutely love this film, my favourite of 2009.

The chinese gangster made for some of the funniest moments,

My favourite scenes:
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn_Tf-197BY 

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsiWdVe2aWg 

 
 
 
The scene where they all get tasered is so damn funny!  

Plus:
"We can't leave the baby in here there's a ****ing tiger in the bathroom!"
 
 
The song about the tiger was awesome!
 
 
The Tiger song
 
 
'It's funny because he's fat'
 
 
 
The tiger song is brilliant, but I laughed most at:

"In the face! IRN THA FAAAYYCE!!!"
 
 
The wolf pack speech by alan.  
 
 
isn't everyone's favourite quote;

'TOOODALOOOOOO *************'
 
 
'Not you Fat Jesus', the guy behind me choked on his popcorn when the cop said that.
 
 
I was surprised by how much I liked this film. I think "Dude Where's My Car" had made me apprehensive, and the fact I'd heard that there was a tiger in the bathroom and a baby and stuff made me like, "WTF". But I thought the plot was actually quite clever and interesting, the characters were really well-drawn and more three-dimensional than a lot of these kinds of films make them, and even though some of it was a bit immature or "obvious" humour it was still pretty funny. I was impressed  
 
 
Alan : 'Thats actually one of the side effects of roofies, memory loss'
 
 
"hunting the streets for strippers and cocaine"
 
 
you're all in my wolfpack; i love the hangover.
 
 
I watched it for the second time today. Wasnt as good as the first time but may be best to watch it with people. Very funny non the less
 
 
Just the seen when he sees the tiger whilst pissing. love it  
 
 
Whatchoo Talkin Bout Willis?
 
 
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HXq-6_CHcY  pretty much all this scene tbh.
 
 
Lets go,im not allowed within 200 yards of a school.or chucky cheeses.
 
 
I love the wolfpack speech.
"Hello,
How about that ride in? I guess that why they call it Sin City. Ha ha."
lmao, this part alone makes me laugh.
 
 
oh, I LOVE this film  

one of my favourite quotes is:

Phil Wenneck: Whose ******* baby is that?
Stu Price: Alan, are you sure you didn't see anyone else in the suite?
Alan Garner: Yeah, I checked all the rooms... no one's there. Check its collar or something.

(   all the other quotes and the scene of Stu singing)

 
 
 
******* love this film!
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoendYt_ZJ0

''It was a night to remember before the wedding and we cant remember a thing!"

&

Haha, felt like they were poking fun at 21.
 
 
I liked this bit  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_oAvdvQW18 
 
 
I loved the bit when they found out the groom had been on the roof all along, and my favourite quote would be "Toodle-ooh Motha******"
