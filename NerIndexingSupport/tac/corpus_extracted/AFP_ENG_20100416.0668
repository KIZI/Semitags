A US basketball player has been expelled from South Korea's professional
basketball league for making an obscene gesture at a referee, the sport's
governing body said Friday.

The Korean Basketball League expelled Ian Johnson of Jeonju KCC Egis for
swearing and raising his middle finger at the referee when his team lost to
Ulsan Mobis Phoebis in the final game of the championship series Sunday.

Johnson, 26, was also fined five million won (4,448 dollars), the league said.

The centre player was fined in February for showing a similar gesture to an
opposing player and rushing into his locker room to provoke a fight.

Johnson is the fifth foreign player to be ousted from South Korea's domestic
basketball league, which allows 10 clubs to have two foreign players each.
