San Diego offers a nice combination of natural beauty and urban vibrancy. Throw
in Southern California's extensive menu of outdoor activities, and it's the
perfect spot for the kind of rejuvenating getaway Jill Ward seeks now that she
has earned her MBA and landed a new job.

America's Finest City (San Diego's moniker) is not around the corner: A
connecting flight will take at least seven hours. But with a vibe that's really
different from anything in Florida or other warmer climes, it's worth the trip.

Success at hitting Ward's $1,000 budget for is contingent on airfare. Snag a
$220 sale fare, and it will be doable, although very tight. Some strategies for
nailing the cheap fare:

_Stay as far away from Easter (April 4) as possible. Many K-12 schools are out
the week before Easter, so planes are fuller and flights are more expensive.

_ Take a connecting flight. A nonstop fare to San Diego will cost at least $100
more.

_ Don't fly on a Friday or a Sunday, when fares are typically more expensive.

_ Sign up for fare notifications at sites such as Airfarewatchdog.com,
Kayak.com, Bing.com/travel and Yapta.com. Buy as soon as a low fare hits.

_ Check Southwest.com separately. The airline's sale fares don't show up on most
third-party booking sites.

_ Look for sale fares to Long Beach, Calif. It's a two-hour drive from there to
San Diego, but with a nonstop flight, the travel time will be similar.

_ Be prepared to pay a few dollars extra for an early flight to San Diego to
maximize your vacation time. A 6 a.m. flight with an hour-long layover should
get into San Diego by 11 a.m. (The three-hour time difference is a good thing on
the way out.)

Once the airfare goal is met, finding a rental car and a cheap, decent and well-
located place to stay are the next hurdles.

A car is a must, as San Diego's mass transit is limited. Rental cars in San
Diego are a good deal, running less than $100, including taxes, for an economy
car for three days. (Hotwire.com offers good rates.)

The San Diego region has many cheap chain hotels, with rates starting at $50 a
night, especially in outlying cities, such as El Cajon and Chula Vista. But I'd
opt for eating ramen noodles and spending the money on more centrally located
accommodations.

Some of the least expensive hotels closer to the beaches and downtown San Diego
are in the Hotel Circle area of Mission Valley. They include the Days Hotel
(www.dayshotelhc.com), where three nights in late March will run about $219,
including taxes. Rooms come equipped with a mini refrigerator, microwave and
coffee maker, necessary items for keeping food costs down. Hotels with decent
reviews located closer to the water and/or downtown are going to cost at least
$100 more for three nights.

Consider renting a condo directly from an owner. While typically a bit more
expensive than a hotel room, condos come with full kitchens where you could cook
meals, so the total cost could wind up cheaper. For example, I found a one-
bedroom in San Diego's North Park neighborhood, within walking distance of
Balboa Park, for $85 a night (plus 10.5 percent taxes) at www.vrbo.com. Other
sites to explore include www.homeaway.com and www.vacationrentals.com. Make sure
the owner details all fees: An $80 cleaning bill, for example, may put you over
budget.

Food will have to take a back seat to stay within budget, but excellent cheap
eats include the Rubicon Deli in Mission Beach, Hodad's Burgers in Ocean Beach,
the Mission in North Park and any Los Panchos Taco Shop. For the big night out,
start with a fancy drink at Bertrand at Mr. A's (www.bertrandatmisteras.com),
which offers fantastic views, then head across the street to Cucina Urbana
(www.sdurbankitchen.com/cucina-urbana.html), where a very nice meal for two can
be had for $30. Afterward, take a walk through downtown's Gaslamp Quarter
(www.gaslamp.org), which offers scores of clubs and bars.

Now for the daytime fun, which has to be either free or cheap _ not a problem in
San Diego. It may be a bit chilly for lazing on the beach: The average high is
66 degrees in March, and the water temperatures are in the high 50s. Here are
just a few ideas (go to www.sandiego.org for more):

_ Take a jog or a walk along the downtown San Diego waterfront, which passes in
front of Seaport Village, a fun shopping area, and the convention center. Just
watching the incredible yachts is entertainment.

_ Spend a day wandering around Balboa Park (www.balboapark.org). Museums aren't
free, but there's no charge for looking at the lovely foliage and exploring the
hiking trails. Pay for the San Diego Zoo (www.sandiegozoo.org): A one-day pass
is $37, but it's worth it.

_ Rent a bike and spend at least half a day riding from Pacific Beach to Mission
Beach to Mission Bay. Cost will be about $10 a person, but biking is a neat way
to see the entire beach area.

_ Go to Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve (www.torreypine.org), a wilderness
area along the coast between La Jolla and Del Mar. It's $10 to park, but guided
nature hikes, offered weekends and holidays at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., are free. Or
pack a picnic and watch the hang gliders.

_ Spend a day in La Jolla. Watch the divers in the cove and the sea lions lazing
on the beach. Splurge with a drink at Georges at the Cove
(www.georgesatthecove.com).

_Take a free tour of the U.S. Olympic Training Center (www.teamusa.org/about-
usoc/chula-vista-olympic-training-ctr) in Chula Vista.

Total cost: Assuming that you score the cheap plane tickets, your hotel, air and
car, including gas money, will run $753. Your night out will run $50; eight
other meals, with generous doses of peanut butter and cereal, will cost $100.
Zoo admission, bike rentals and a trip to Torrey Pines comes to $104. Final
tally is $1,027. (Eat more ramen noodles to come in under $1,000.)
