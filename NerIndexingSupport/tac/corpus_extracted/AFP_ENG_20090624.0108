The United Arab Emirates government approved a law to create a new finance
house, Emirates Development Bank, with capital of 10 billion dirhams (2.7
billion dollars), official Wam news agency reported on Wednesday.

The government will invest five billion dirhams in the bank, to be formed from
the merger of Real Estate Bank and Industrial Bank, newspapers reported.

Amlak Finance and Tamweel, the two biggest mortgage banks in the emirate of
Dubai with assets of around seven billion dollars, also agreed at the end of
last year to merge under UAE government supervision.
