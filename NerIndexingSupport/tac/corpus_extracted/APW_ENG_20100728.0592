Former England defender Sol Campbell will maintain his record of playing in every season of the Premier League after joining newly promoted Newcastle on a one-year contract on Wednesday.

Campbell links up with Newcastle manager Chris Hughton, who was a coach at Tottenham when Campbell joined the north London club at the age of 14.

The 35-year-old Campbell made his league debut for Tottenham in December 1992, midway through the Premier League's inaugural season.

Only David James, Ryan Giggs and Gary Speed have played more Premier League matches than Campbell's 496. James and Giggs are also still playing.

"I have known Sol since he was a lad at Tottenham and am fully aware of what he has to offer," Hughton said. "That is experience, quality, calm assurance and leadership. He's a dedicated professional, a terrific addition to the squad, and I look forward to working with him again."

The move means that Campbell has never cost a transfer fee in an 18-year career that has included 73 international caps and appearances at six international tournaments.

Campbell was a free agent after the expiry of his short-term contract with Arsenal, the club he controversially joined from Tottenham in 2001.

He won two Premier League titles and three FA Cups in an initial five-year spell with Arsenal before three seasons at Portsmouth, with whom he won the 2008 FA Cup as captain.

Campbell joined lowly Notts County in August 2009 but walked out on the fourth-tier club just one game into a five-year contract. He trained with Arsenal while he was without a club to maintain fitness, eventually persuading manager Arsene Wenger to sign him until the end of the season.

He started 10 Premier League matches, helping the Gunners to finish third -- five points ahead of fourth-place Tottenham.

But Wenger only signed Campbell as backup to his regular central defenders. He occasionally looked ponderous against quick opponents and his positioning under the high ball was suspect.

"At this stage of my career, I couldn't have wished for a better move," Campbell said. "To join a club such as Newcastle United, with its proud tradition, heritage and magnificent support, is absolutely tremendous for me."

Newcastle was relegated from the Premier League in 2009 but won the second-tier League Championship to clinch an immediate return to the topflight.

"I'd like to thank Chris Hughton for putting his faith in me and aim to repay him and the supporters by giving everything I possibly can to help re-establish this great club in the top-tier of English football," Campbell said.
