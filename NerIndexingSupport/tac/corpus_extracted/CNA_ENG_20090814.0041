Kaohisung Mayor Yang Chiu-hsing said Friday he will convene a meeting to discuss
the possibility of establishing a memorial park at the site of the southern
Taiwan village of Siaollin, which was completely buried by mudslides during
Typhoon Morakot last week.

In response to a suggestion by survivors that the village should not be
excavated, Yang said he hopes to establish a memorial park on the site and thus
avoid destroying the bodies of the people buried under the mudslide.

Yang also said the county government will not give up its search for survivors
and will help typhoon victims to rebuild their homes.

Some 380 people are feared buried under the mudslides that covered the village.
