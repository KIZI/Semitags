Five soldiers and two police have been killed in an attack on a security post in
the strife-torn eastern region of Democratic Republic of Congo, the army said
Tuesday, blaming Rwandan rebels.

A local militia group, however, also claimed responsibility for the attack,
which took place overnight Monday in the Nord Kivu region, near the border with
Uganda.

The Congolese army's spokesman in Nord Kivu, Sylvain Ekenge, told AFP that about
40 rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a
predominantly Rwandan Hutu group, carried out the attack.

Based in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the FDLR rebels, some of whom,
took part in the Rwandan 1994 genocide, are considered a major source of
insecurity in the region.

Five soldiers, two police and three rebels were killed during the attack, Ekenge
said, adding that rebel forces also kidnapped three people, including a child.

He said the attackers had "taken refuge in Virunga (National) Park, and our
troops are hunting them down."

He said the organiser of the attack was Patient Akilimali, a member of former
rebel group the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), which
integrated into the Congolese army in early 2009. Akilimali deserted from the
army in October.

The Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC), a local militia group,
also claimed that its military wing, the National Congolese Forces (FNC), had
carried out the attack and that Akilimali had joined the FPLC.

"It was the National Congolese Forces that carried out the attack," said the
FPLC's spokesman, Aime Munyakazi, claiming that eight Congolese soldiers had
been killed.

Rebel and militia groups, along with rogue army elements, have been battling for
control of mineral riches in eastern DR Congo provinces for several years.
