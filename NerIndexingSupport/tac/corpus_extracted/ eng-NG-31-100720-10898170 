In a brand new ad by the Obama camp, Obama said that he wants the
exact same opportunity for his daughters as for America's sons.  Now,
the idea of gender equality is a great notion...realized by the GOP on
the ticket instead of McCain.  However, how true is his statement?

Does Obama really want the EXACT same opportunity for his daughters as
the sons of common Americans?  Does that mean that he will take them
out of their private schools, or will he support vouchers to let
common Americans send their kids to expensive private schools?  Will
he keep all of his daughters from sharing his wealth upon graduation,
or will he give his personal money to ALL graduating children of
Americans?  Can it possibly be true that he wants the EXACT same
opportunity for his daughters and our sons, or is Obama caught in
campaign talk that even his own organization said cannot be expected
to be fulfilled?
