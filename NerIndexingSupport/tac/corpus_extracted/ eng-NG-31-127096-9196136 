Sorry to be rude, crude and vulgar.But what a lot of garbage.

"Bush is closely related to every European monarch on and off the throne and
has kinship with every member of Britain's royal family, the House of
Windsor."

What is a relative? A first cousin? A second cousin? A 3rd? A 6th? Where do
we stop regarding related people as a "relative"? In think in many societies
even a second cousin is stretching it.

For George W and Queen Elizabeth II I found as a common ancestor John
Knyvett 1517-1561 this makes them 13th cousins. Do you really think Queen
Elizabeth II regards every "13th cousin" a close relative? Gary Boyd Roberts
is his book on the American presidents "stretches the imagination" for
George W to a "almost certainly" 12th cousin or so to Lady Diana Spencer and
she is not Queen Elizabeth II. He also shows that George W's mother is about
26 generations removed from King Henry II of England 1133-1189.

Do you really think that the governments of the countries "ruled" by "close
relatives" of George W really think "We must support George W _because_ he
is "closely related" to our monarch?

Get real. In the foreword of a book published in 1929 is discussed people
with Anglo-Saxon blood : "Every one of us is descended from William
the Conqueror, and Anglo-Saxons are, all of us, at least thirtieth cousins
to each other". And there goes the exclusiveness for George W as a "close
relative" of Queen Elizabeth II. My guess is that people with Anglo-Saxon
blood can be found in every country in the world.

We have been, again, the victims of crossposting. I wonder when Douglas
Richardson, who supports this, is going to tell us about the benefits of
crossposting.
