I love to hear Republican code and figuring out the actual message. Paul Ryan was still hawking his main talking points starting out with Democrats won't negotiate, be flexible or give an inch and pushing the two main aspects of his economic "plan".

Number one was "Health Care":

"We need to move our Health Care to the private sector to "save money"."

So we move the Medicare and possibly the VA to Health Care companies. Remember, these companies don't actually do anything "medical". They don't own hospitals or employ doctors or nurses. They are "middle men" only. They skim money off insurance policies for their "fair share" for "doing the paperwork". This is how they are able to pay a CEO bonus for Aetna or Chigna more than $100,000,000.00 or even more. Sometimes much more.

These companies make their profit by figuring out legal ways of denying care to people who become sick. One of their favorite ways is to declare a "pre existing condition" like having an allergy or having a mammogram in the last six months, or having had your tonsils out as a child. All of these have been used as "pre existing conditions with links to reputable sites proving that having been posted here many times. This was why "pre existing conditions" was spelled out in the Health Care Bill.

The worst part about Ryan's Plan (now the Republican's Plan) is that it ends up costing America so much more in many ways. If people don't have health care, and certainly seniors won't using a "voucher" plan, their "health care" becomes "emergency room" care at many times the cost. Care that's provided by the tax payer, but at 10 times or more the cost. That's the main point and the one point he is never asked.

Then Chris Wallace asked if "Revenues are on the table" and Ryan said "yes" and this is how:

The second code is "Broaden the tax base" to raise revenue.

Then he describes the plan. Lower rates, close loopholes, broaden the tax base. Sounds easy, but what does it really mean?

Lower rates - he means on the wealthy because they are the "job creators".

Close Loopholes - lower rates and close loopholes together means with some fancy book keeping, you can say you made the tax code easier and more manageable and stopped the richest Americans from using the loopholes, only you lowered their rates so they are paying the same "or less".

Broaden the tax base - that means moving a larger share of the tax burden to the poor and the middle class. Exactly the opposite of what everyone except the very richest, like Paul Ryan, want. Lower rates and broaden the tax base - code for move the burden from the rich to the rest of America. That's what it means. Clear as shiny new glass.

So Republicans may run on "code", but Democrats have to translate "shyster code" to "plain English". Republicans say, "Let America decide". Yea, tell the truth and let America decide. If the polls are any indication, some have already made up their minds. Let's see how well Republicans sell their "Lemon Stew".

A shyster is slang word for someone who acts in a disreputable, unethical, or unscrupulous way, especially in the practice of law, politics and business.
 
 
I was watching Gov. Huckabee last night, and Charles Rangle was on his show, he was talking about having a fairer tax.
Since he got into trouble with his taxes, he seems to have finally seen how our tax code is too complicated.
He said he was going to get some kind of bill together for a more fair and simpler tax.
We will see how this goes over with all of the progressives.

Wealthy people have lawyers that handle their taxes. Even though my taxes are a large part of my income, they aren't that difficult to do. I only have one job and the only thing of real value is my 401 and I know that millions of Americans are like me, but without the 401.

If they can simplify the tax code, fine, but most of the time, that's code for "move the burden to the middle class. Since the rich, by buying politicians and having them do their bidding have created this mess, I suspect the middle class will once again get the short end of the stick in the worst possible place.
 
 
Greetings from the NY 26th....Please run on that! Ryan, a fourth generation millionnaire brat, is incredibly tone deaf on taxes on the rich and Medicare. Perry/Ryan 2012!! LOL!
 
 
Paul Ryan would be a great President. He gets it.
 
 
I only read 6% of the OP.
 
 
"What he's really saying" is just code for..."I'm a Socialist/Progressive and i hate anyone who isn't. Therefore i will just make up shit to smear."
 
 
Funny that he said in that interview, 'Both parties got us to where we are',

and yet HIS plan does everything it can to let the Republicans off the hook.
 
 
Why isnt there a federal food program? Shouldn't the government give us our daily bread? Why are greedy rich supermarkets making money from us?

Now you are thinking like some "charity based Republican organization". This is why Democrats and liberals prefer education.

Give a man a fish and he eats for a day, TEACH a man to fish and he feeds his family for a lifetime.

Republicans don't know what they means. They think it's something "Socialist" or "Marxist" or "communist" or "community organizer" or "teacher", of course, to them, those are all "interchangeable". They prefer "charity". Keeps them dependent and makes Republicans feel better about themselves.

The problem we have is that you don't believe this. If you did, we wouldn't have the entitlement mentality that the left encourages. It is the right wing that believes we should teach people to help themselves. The left just wants them forever condemned to hand outs.... so they keep voting for more benefits from the Dems. All the Dems want is power. Y'all don't give a shit about people.

And your lying is pathetic.

Pathetic is you. Social security is paid for. I've been paying into it since I was 12.

Medicare is infinitely less expensive than "Health Care for Profit" and "emergency rooms". Unless you advocate death as "health care for the poor, disabled and elderly"?

What is wrong with you jerks? How did right wingers, and you ARE a right winger, get so ignorant and so mean. I didn't used to think "monsters" were real.

Greedy capitalists CEO at food stores make money off the Proletariat!!!
 
 
It's a real shame they didn't listen to Paul Ryan. He had some good common sense solutions. But the Democrats just had to label him a "Racist" & "Terrorist" and completely tuned him out. This is the state of Politics in America unfortunately. The loudest and most ignorant get all the Press. We have a very bleak future in this Country.

Rdean is trying to translate a "code" that someone is using? Isn't that like asking a bunch of monkeys to type Shakespeare?

I don't think I even read that much of it.
 
 
 
Paul Ryan on Fox with Chris Wallace: What he's really saying?

 

Probably standard Ryan fare: end Medicare, slash Medicaid, eliminate the top tax brackets. Oh, and raise the debt ceiling $9 trillion so we don't get too many questions about why his "plan" continues to deficit spend.
 
 
Paul Ryan really did have some good common sense solutions. But oh well,he's just a "Racist" and a "Terrorist" right? This country is so dumbed down. It's scary.  
 
 
 
Funny that he said in that interview, 'Both parties got us to where we are',

That's code for the GOP screwed up so bad that they can't deny responsibility, so they try to avoid their responsibility by sharing the blame.
 
 
Could it be what he said was what he really meant? Only the liberals speak in code and they seem to think everyone speaks in code. You can't ever believe what the libs say. Remember "I'll put all bills on the internet for 3days before voting?" Code for " you have to pass it if you want to see what's in it",
. Remember "The most open and transparent administration in history"? Code for closed door committees. Only Libs speak code. You can't trust what they say.

A 401 ? Taxes are a large part of my income?

You're so fucking stupid.

The guy who still erroneously uses "premium support" to describe VoucherCare? Unlikely.

If Todsterpatriot wasn't such a hypocrite he would explain it to you. He claims that Bush only had a $161 billion deficit in 2007 because the $340 billion Bush borrowed from SS and the other trust funds are an asset that just needs to be redeemed. But, of course, as I tried to explain to him, to redeem the IOUs the government has to borrow the money, as you just pointed out.

So as long as CON$ claim that the biggest Bush deficit was $400 billion, as the little fairy Jeffy Sessions did today on the Sunday talk shows, then SS has about a $3 trillion surplus banked, in government treasury bonds backed by the full faith and credit of a GOP default.  
 
 
See what I mean about right wingers?

"Broaden the tax base IS move more of the burden to the middle class".

A voucher program with him saying he wants to move Medicare to "for profit" companies IS moving Medicare to "for profit" companies.

And right wingers call me names. They call me liar. The scream and rant, or say, "I refuse to read it".

But not a single one can say where I'm wrong. No right winger can say, "Republicans want to help elderly Americans". No right winger can say, "Republicans want to support the Middle Class".

Not a one. Not a single one.

So go ahead. Call me names. It's code for "We hate you for being right". If only they were ashamed of what their party is doing. And I thought monsters didn't really exist.
 
 
SS is paid for. Not its fault people borrow from its fund.

"All the Dems want is power. Y'all don't give a shit about people." Power to do what? Not pollute, screw the workers, and pander to the greedy rich and corporations. Tell me ONE thing Dems do that ISN"T for the good of ALL people. YOU ARE DUPED.
 
 
Paul Ryan is an awful Racist Terrorist!!! Well that's the latest stupid Left/Democrat Talking Point anyway. Paul Ryan made sense but the spastic dumbed-down Left/Democrats were too busy smearing the guy to actually listen. Party before Country. That's the slogan that should replace their "Hope & Change" slogan. It really does say it all about the Democratic Party at this point.

Probably standard Ryan fare: end Medicare, slash Medicaid, eliminate the top tax brackets. Oh, and raise the debt ceiling $9 trillion so we don't get too many questions about why his "plan" continues to deficit spend.

 

When did Ryan ever advocate ending Medicare? Who was it who slashed $500B from Medicare? Hint, it wasn't Ryan.
Had we simply adopted the Ryan plan we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.
 
 
 
When did Ryan ever advocate ending Medicare?

 

In the budget resolution that was jammed through the House in April.

 
Who was it who slashed $500B from Medicare? Hint, it wasn't Ryan.

 

I think I understand your constant confusion about Ryan's budget now: you're completely unfamiliar with it. Yes, Ryan's budget contains the exact same Medicare spending reductions as the ACA (how else do you think he finds savings in the 10-year budget window? He makes sure not to actually launch the elimination of Medicare until the second decade, on the assumption he can keep current seniors in the Republican fold by delaying the end of Medicare). The difference is that he then goes substantially further and forbids anyone from enrolling in Medicare ever again after a certain point, beginning the end of Medicare. Instead of receiving access to public health insurance ("Medicare"), seniors are forced to look for private insurance (e.g. Aetna or Anthem, etc). Bold stuff. You should probably read it at some point.

Here comes Rabbi's semantics games. His plan ends Medicare. Just because you're only concerned with what it is called and not how it functions doesn't mean "Medicare" isn't essentially ending under his plan.

Give a man a fish and he eats for a day, TEACH a man to fish and he feeds his family for a lifetime.

Conservatives would end public education if they ever had the power to do so.

The conservative vision of America is a small rich and powerful elite, and masses of working poor, and as a conservative,

you hope you make it into the former, not the latter.

Oh yeah. There is still a plan called Medicare. It still provides more or less what the present one provides. It functions in a manner that will guarantee its solvency down the road, unlike Obama's plan that guarantees the opposite.
Boy have you been snookered. But no one accused you of being the smartest guy in the room. Even when you're alone.

Oh, btw, this crap with lowering the marginal rates and then eliminating the loopholes, credits, exemptions, etc.,

supposedly to end up with more revenue in the end?

It's a scam. They want to get the rates lower, period, because they know it's extremely difficult to raise the rates themselves.

The loopholes? They'll find their way back in, here and there, bit by bit, over time. It's relatively easy to slip a tax break into legislation.

Let the Republicans lower the top rates and the corporate rates under this ruse and the rich and the corporations will end up paying less, period.

Ask yourself, why would the rich and the corporations support Ryan's plan if it was going to leave them paying more? Seriously, use your heads people.
 
 
Medicare will be demolished when the Dem Health Care Debacle kicks in. Are they really blaming Ryan for that? Man,the Left just needs to get more informed. They need to slow down on their HuffPoop & MSLSD Talking Points.

.

 

"More or less". LOL. Thanks.

As long as its called Medicare, its all good, right?
 
 
 
Are they really blaming Ryan for that?

 

No, they're blaming Ryan for proposing to dismantle Medicare. Ending public health insurance for the elderly.

You think that just by retaining the name, that means Medicare can't be ended.

And you're serious...

Remember Rabbi is the same person who

- Thinks a good solution for people without health insurance is using Power of attorney.  

- That black people can't be good leaders simply because of their skin color  

- And that an increase of 10% of people to 15% of people is somehow NOT an increase of 50%

So yeah, only caring that its still called Medicare is right up Rabbis alley.

"A premium support payment" sure sounds like a VOUCHER to pay the premium on a private health insurance plan.

SEC. 501. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.

(2) For future generations, when they reach eligibility, Medicare is reformed to provide a premium support payment and a selection of guaranteed health coverage options from which recipients can choose a plan that best suits their needs.
 
 
The dems don't understand what some repubs and all TEA PARTY want to accomplish. We care about the elderly, all of us have relatives that need Social Security and medicare we just want to make it sustainable. Do we seem pro business? Yes. Business are the ONLY thing we have that create jobs that give us tax revenue. Government jobs eat revenue, private business jobs generate revenue. If we lower taxes and regulations on business they will create more jobs. They want to create more jobs, it makes them money and generates tax revenue. If you want more revenue don;t tax the few people that have jobs at a higher rate, create more private industry jobs that will generate more revenue. If we get the government out of the way jobs will be created. When we have 100% unemployment all of our economic problems will go away. This isn't likely to happen as long a obama tries to regulate every aspect of every business and make it too risky for businesses to expand so unless he is willing to change his way there will be no change in sight. Don't blame the TEA PARTY for obamas lack of ability to generate tax revenue.
 
 
 
 
Could it be what he said was what he really meant?

 

The guy who still erroneously uses "premium support" to describe VoucherCare? Unlikely.

 

OK genius.

Explain to me how Ryan's plan is not premium support.
 
 
We cannot trust the government with our health, they broke SocSecurity, how can we trust them with Medicare?

See what I mean about right wingers?

"Broaden the tax base IS move more of the burden to the middle class".

 

According to the CBO broadening the tax base is code for eliminating subsidies and loopholes while lowering the tax rate. This should actually result in higher taxes across the board.

 http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/50xx/doc5...c09-Part06.pdf 

You obviously have the wrong decoder ring.

 
A voucher program with him saying he wants to move Medicare to "for profit" companies IS moving Medicare to "for profit" companies.

 

Kind of like the highly popular Medicare Advantage program that Democrats want to eliminate because it actually works?

 
And right wingers call me names. They call me liar. The scream and rant, or say, "I refuse to read it".

 

I did not say I refuse to read it, I said I doubt I read 6% of it. I stopped reading when you claimed to be able to decode Ryan's words.

Turns out I was right.

 
But not a single one can say where I'm wrong. No right winger can say, "Republicans want to help elderly Americans". No right winger can say, "Republicans want to support the Middle Class".

 

I have pointed out where you are wrong so many times I have carpal tunnel. Yet you keep coming back and posting the same stupid lies over and over again.

 
Not a one. Not a single one.

 

Does this mean I am officially not a right-winger?

 
So go ahead. Call me names. It's code for "We hate you for being right". If only they were ashamed of what their party is doing. And I thought monsters didn't really exist.

 

FYI, pointing out you are stupid is not calling you names.

When did Ryan ever advocate ending Medicare?

 

In the budget resolution that was jammed through the House in April.

 
Who was it who slashed $500B from Medicare? Hint, it wasn't Ryan.

 

I think I understand your constant confusion about Ryan's budget now: you're completely unfamiliar with it. Yes, Ryan's budget contains the exact same Medicare spending reductions as the ACA (how else do you think he finds savings in the 10-year budget window? He makes sure not to actually launch the elimination of Medicare until the second decade, on the assumption he can keep current seniors in the Republican fold by delaying the end of Medicare). The difference is that he then goes substantially further and forbids anyone from enrolling in Medicare ever again after a certain point, beginning the end of Medicare. Instead of receiving access to public health insurance ("Medicare"), seniors are forced to look for private insurance (e.g. Aetna or Anthem, etc). Bold stuff. You should probably read it at some point.

 

The amazing thing about your post is you make it sound like you actually know what you are talking about. I note one glaring thing though, no actual link to any site that shows the actual text of the Ryan bill that even starts to support your claim.

I wonder why.
 
 
 
 
 
Probably standard Ryan fare: end Medicare, slash Medicaid, eliminate the top tax brackets. Oh, and raise the debt ceiling $9 trillion so we don't get too many questions about why his "plan" continues to deficit spend.

 

When did Ryan ever advocate ending Medicare? Who was it who slashed $500B from Medicare? Hint, it wasn't Ryan.
Had we simply adopted the Ryan plan we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.

 

Why do you idiots keep asking that?

 

Because no one has ever managed to explain how shifting what Medicare does is an end to Medicare. Coming from the same people that argue that Obamacare does not take over health care it is mindbogglingly opaque.

Hey STUPID, I was not talking to you. If I had replied to you and asked why you had not posted a link you might have a point.

Greenbeard always supplies links when he thinks he is right, and actually supplies the exact quotes to back up his point. He does this because he is actually a shill that is posting for the DNC, and has a research staff available to help him find things, which is why he was actually able to link to Obamacare, and quote the sections he liked, immediately after the 2000 page bill was posted.

Since he did not do so here, I know he is blowing hot air. You are just a partisan hack, which is why I did not challenge you to back up anything you said. I usually ignore you because I know you have no understanding of anything that we are talking about.
 
 
 
 
 
Really? What does it replace with? What is the new plan called?
Oh yeah. There is still a plan called Medicare. It still provides more or less what the present one provides. It functions in a manner that will guarantee its solvency down the road, unlike Obama's plan that guarantees the opposite.
Boy have you been snookered. But no one accused you of being the smartest guy in the room. Even when you're alone.

 

You think that just by retaining the name, that means Medicare can't be ended.

And you're serious...

 

Remember Rabbi is the same person who

- Thinks a good solution for people without health insurance is using Power of attorney.  

- That black people can't be good leaders simply because of their skin color  

- And that an increase of 10% of people to 15% of people is somehow NOT an increase of 50%

So yeah, only caring that its still called Medicare is right up Rabbis alley.

 

Shockingly you cannot support anything you write there.
In fact Ryan's plan assures that Medicare can continue to offer medical insurance to elderly people who would otherwise find themselves without care. Unlike Obama's plan, which will cut reimbursements to the point where no doctor will accept it.
 
 
 
 
 
Paul Ryan on Fox with Chris Wallace: What he's really saying?

 

Probably standard Ryan fare: end Medicare, slash Medicaid, eliminate the top tax brackets. Oh, and raise the debt ceiling $9 trillion so we don't get too many questions about why his "plan" continues to deficit spend.

 

When did Ryan ever advocate ending Medicare? Who was it who slashed $500B from Medicare? Hint, it wasn't Ryan.
Had we simply adopted the Ryan plan we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.

 

You didn't like it that Obama cut $500,000,000,000. in payoffs to private insurance that was coming from Medicare? Very interesting.
 
 
 
I love to hear Republican code and figuring out the actual message. Paul Ryan was still hawking his main talking points starting out with Democrats won't negotiate, be flexible or give an inch and pushing the two main aspects of his economic "plan".

Number one was "Health Care":

"We need to move our Health Care to the private sector to "save money"."

So we move the Medicare and possibly the VA to Health Care companies. Remember, these companies don't actually do anything "medical". They don't own hospitals or employ doctors or nurses. They are "middle men" only. They skim money off insurance policies for their "fair share" for "doing the paperwork". This is how they are able to pay a CEO bonus for Aetna or Chigna more than $100,000,000.00 or even more. Sometimes much more.

 

Dean this is not completely true. Companies like Kaiser do actually do something medical. We do need to save money by moving seniors to HMO's like the rest of us and privatising the VA. They have an expertise in trauma that could be shared with others.

We will ultimately have a choice. Pay for unconstrained health care for seniors and do nothing else or modify health care for seniors.

The only question I can see is do we mandate some kind of floor.

I didnt find it credible because every time they cut Medicare like that they always go back and make the "doc fix". So there was no cut at all, only a proposed one. That is what Democrats do: propose stuff they never follow through on. Republicans actually do stuff.

Sure I can, it's right in my signature.
 
 
With Ryan's plan, those who become eligible for Medicare starting 2021 they will be directed to private insurance companies and they will get a voucher for $8000 to help pay for their premiums. After that the annual increase in the vouchers will be based on the CPI (Consumer Price Index). The CPI is used to measure inflation but it leaves out the increased prices of food and energy. Also, the cost of health care has risen 3 to 4 times the rate of the growth of the CPI, so over the years those on Medicare will be paying more and more of their annual premiums.
Because of this, Ryan got really badgered at his town hall meeting and eventually stopped having them because he had no defense.

Ryan's plan doesn't allow Medicare to offer insurance to anyone new beginning in 2021. Indeed, those whose health insurance at that point is provided by Medicare will be gently pushed out of the program (yes, in part by a dwindling provider network). With enrollment halted forever, Medicare is left to be phased out by attrition.

The key concept behind Ryan's proposal is that Medicare will not offer insurance anymore, instead forcing seniors to go buy it in the private market. How are you unaware of this?

A little history for you. The SGR formula was created by the Republicans in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The annual manual override of it was kicked off by Republican Congresses beginning in 2003.

Tell us again how they "actually do stuff."

They are "middle men" only. They skim money off insurance policies for their "fair share" for "doing the paperwork". This is how they are able to pay a CEO bonus for Aetna or Chigna more than $100,000,000.00 or even more. Sometimes much more.

These companies make their profit by figuring out legal ways of denying care to people who become sick. One of their favorite ways is to declare a "pre existing condition" like having an allergy or having a mammogram in the last six months, or having had your tonsils out as a child. All of these have been used as "pre existing conditions with links to reputable sites proving that having been posted here many times. This was why "pre existing conditions" was spelled out in the Health Care Bill.

The worst part about Ryan's Plan (now the Republican's Plan) is that it ends up costing America so much more in many ways. If people don't have health care, and certainly seniors won't using a "voucher" plan, their "health care" becomes "emergency room" care at many times the cost. Care that's provided by the tax payer, but at 10 times or more the cost. That's the main point and the one point he is never asked.

Then Chris Wallace asked if "Revenues are on the table" and Ryan said "yes" and this is how:

The second code is "Broaden the tax base" to raise revenue.

Then he describes the plan. Lower rates, close loopholes, broaden the tax base. Sounds easy, but what does it really mean?

Lower rates - he means on the wealthy because they are the "job creators".

Close Loopholes - lower rates and close loopholes together means with some fancy book keeping, you can say you made the tax code easier and more manageable and stopped the richest Americans from using the loopholes, only you lowered their rates so they are paying the same "or less".

Broaden the tax base - that means moving a larger share of the tax burden to the poor and the middle class. Exactly the opposite of what everyone except the very richest, like Paul Ryan, want. Lower rates and broaden the tax base - code for move the burden from the rich to the rest of America. That's what it means. Clear as shiny new glass.

So Republicans may run on "code", but Democrats have to translate "shyster code" to "plain English". Republicans say, "Let America decide". Yea, tell the truth and let America decide. If the polls are any indication, some have already made up their minds. Let's see how well Republicans sell their "Lemon Stew".

A shyster is slang word for someone who acts in a disreputable, unethical, or unscrupulous way, especially in the practice of law, politics and business.

 

Shyster? Fifty percent of those of us who pay FEDERAL INCOME TAX have to lug the other 50% of you leeches around and you want to call us "shysters"?

DUMB ass

Towards the end of the interview Ryan said he wouldn't be adverse to increasing revenue IF the spending cuts outpaced that by a 3 or 4 to 1 ration AND he believed Obama and Dems got serious about addressing the entitlement programs. Not raising taxes perse, but instead reforming the tax code to eliminate or reduce loopholes, tax breaks, and subsidies. I'd be okay with that, but his point is well taken - I wouldn't be for giving more money to the federal gov't so they can spend it on yet another temporary spending program that results in a temporary bump in employment but doesn't fix the underlying structural problems.
 
 
 
The dems don't understand what some repubs and all TEA PARTY want to accomplish. We care about the elderly, all of us have relatives that need Social Security and medicare we just want to make it sustainable. Do we seem pro business? Yes. Business are the ONLY thing we have that create jobs that give us tax revenue. Government jobs eat revenue, private business jobs generate revenue. If we lower taxes and regulations on business they will create more jobs. They want to create more jobs, it makes them money and generates tax revenue. If you want more revenue don;t tax the few people that have jobs at a higher rate, create more private industry jobs that will generate more revenue. If we get the government out of the way jobs will be created. When we have 100% unemployment all of our economic problems will go away. This isn't likely to happen as long a obama tries to regulate every aspect of every business and make it too risky for businesses to expand so unless he is willing to change his way there will be no change in sight. Don't blame the TEA PARTY for obamas lack of ability to generate tax revenue.

 

You could have everyone working for 51 cents an hour like they do in China and that would end unemployment. But would you really want to live in such a country?
Quick sucking the toes of private business. They are making more money that ever and NOT creating more jobs. How do you think that's being done?

If you actually questioned your talking points, you might figure out how to say something meaningful. Go learn something.

As far as regulation, let's deregulate every fucking thing. Drive your family around in a car built without regulation. Live in a house without regulation. Give your kid a glass of milk. Unregulated milk. They do that in China.

 2 face execution over China milk scandal 

 

Zheng Shuzhen, center, the grandmother of a baby who died after drinking tainted milk, cries outside a court in Shijiazhuang, China, on Thursday. Although the chairwoman of the firm at the center of the scandal was jailed, Zheng said the sentence didn't "lessen our hate" for her.

What did our country do to deserve these ignorant right wingers? I vote we let them secede and refuse to give them the foreign aid they will undoubtedly beg for.

Yes, we even fool ourselves by paying interest. Because we borrowed it.

goddammit but you're dumb. social security, by law, cannot add to the debt. it does not currently - and there is no provision for social security to borrow money in any way shape or form.

Because its the Biggest Financial Fraud in History!

It takes in money its supposed to invest and instead buys securities with no value! That's why Obama said he had to borrow to pay current obligations! He didn't say, "Social security beneficiaries need not worry about their checks because we'll just sell some of the assets in the trust fund"

It's adds to the debt because it's a fraud and can only pay obligations by issuing more debt

If people were the least bit financially literate, there would be blood in the streets
 
 
 
Paul Ryan would be a great President. He gets it.

 

A politician that advocates slashing access to medical care for seniors in exchange for he, himself, getting a tax cut, no, that is not someone who "gets it".

so if those notes weren't sold to social security but were instead sold to some imaginary country we'll call Madeupland would that make a difference?

would you then say that Madeupland is adding to our national debt? of course not.

If we are at the debt ceiling and the SS Fund sells a bond to bring in cash, what happens? Nothing. Why? Because the government can't borrow money to give to the SS Fund.

This is why Obama said what he said. It was 100% true, even if you don't believe it.
 
 
 
 
The dems don't understand what some repubs and all TEA PARTY want to accomplish. We care about the elderly, all of us have relatives that need Social Security and medicare we just want to make it sustainable. Do we seem pro business? Yes. Business are the ONLY thing we have that create jobs that give us tax revenue. Government jobs eat revenue, private business jobs generate revenue. If we lower taxes and regulations on business they will create more jobs. They want to create more jobs, it makes them money and generates tax revenue. If you want more revenue don;t tax the few people that have jobs at a higher rate, create more private industry jobs that will generate more revenue. If we get the government out of the way jobs will be created. When we have 100% unemployment all of our economic problems will go away. This isn't likely to happen as long a obama tries to regulate every aspect of every business and make it too risky for businesses to expand so unless he is willing to change his way there will be no change in sight. Don't blame the TEA PARTY for obamas lack of ability to generate tax revenue.

 

You could have everyone working for 51 cents an hour like they do in China and that would end unemployment. But would you really want to live in such a country?
Quick sucking the toes of private business. They are making more money that ever and NOT creating more jobs. How do you think that's being done?

If you actually questioned your talking points, you might figure out how to say something meaningful. Go learn something.

As far as regulation, let's deregulate every fucking thing. Drive your family around in a car built without regulation. Live in a house without regulation. Give your kid a glass of milk. Unregulated milk. They do that in China.

 2 face execution over China milk scandal 

 

Zheng Shuzhen, center, the grandmother of a baby who died after drinking tainted milk, cries outside a court in Shijiazhuang, China, on Thursday. Although the chairwoman of the firm at the center of the scandal was jailed, Zheng said the sentence didn't "lessen our hate" for her.

What did our country do to deserve these ignorant right wingers? I vote we let them secede and refuse to give them the foreign aid they will undoubtedly beg for.

 

All of FDR Labor Laws need to be repealed

I see. So the prohibition on selling Treasuries apply only to the US Government? Is a Fidelity Bond Fund allowed to sell the Treasury Bond that it owns?
 
 
Just a FYI, risk insurance violates my religious tenets, so in all this obfuscation y'all seem so good at

about something thats my own damn business, my medical care or lack of....

I have a question.

Just how do you think you will get away with mandating

risk insurance.

Do you really think i Can be forced to sin just because you mandated

someone of my faith to buy risk insurance?

Dont ya'll think this might cause a problem? i do.

Allah u akbar!
 
 
 
 
See what I mean about right wingers?

"Broaden the tax base IS move more of the burden to the middle class".

 

According to the CBO broadening the tax base is code for eliminating subsidies and loopholes while lowering the tax rate. This should actually result in higher taxes across the board.

REPUBLICANS WILL NOT INCREASE TAXES. THEY SEE SUBSIDIES AS TAX RELIEF. REMOVE THE SUBSIDES AND THAT EQUALS INCREASING TAXES. REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THEY WANT THE POOR TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE.

 http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/50xx/doc5...c09-Part06.pdf 

You obviously have the wrong decoder ring.

 
A voucher program with him saying he wants to move Medicare to "for profit" companies IS moving Medicare to "for profit" companies.

 

Kind of like the highly popular Medicare Advantage program that Democrats want to eliminate because it actually works?

I did not say I refuse to read it, I said I doubt I read 6% of it. I stopped reading when you claimed to be able to decode Ryan's words.

Turns out I was right.

I have pointed out where you are wrong so many times I have carpal tunnel. Yet you keep coming back and posting the same stupid lies over and over again.

 
Not a one. Not a single one.

 

Does this mean I am officially not a right-winger?

 
So go ahead. Call me names. It's code for "We hate you for being right". If only they were ashamed of what their party is doing. And I thought monsters didn't really exist.

 

FYI, pointing out you are stupid is not calling you names.

 

You are so full of shit it squeezes out your nostrils. I've never seen you right about anything. You don't research. You don't post links. You just say you're right. That makes you a right winger because that's what THEY do.

"It's bad enough that Republicans are doing everything they can to protect tax breaks for millionaires and special interests, but the fact that the Republican idea of shared sacrifice means going after the those who are struggling the most is completely reprehensible," Shah said.

 Hatch Saying Poor Need To Do More To Shrink The Debt 

------------------------------------------------

 http://blogs.roanoke.com/dancasey/20...-tax-the-poor/ 

He said that the poor of our country should share some of the responsibility for paying down the national debt.

That sounds good on its face  until you look at what has happened in this country for most of the last 40 years: The leaders of our nation have systematically lowered taxes on the wealthiest citizens in the land by large amounts, and on the poor and middle class by small amounts, while cutting welfare and other services to the neediest and passing sky-high increases in defense budgets.

------------------------------------------------

In lamenting what she calls the "job-killing tax code," Bachmann points the finger at all these poverty-stricken people living it up, spending their minimum wage on slices of American cheese and Wonder Bread.

"Part of the problem is today, only 53 percent pay any federal income tax at all -- 47 percent pay nothing," Bachmann says. "We need to broaden the base so that everybody pays something, even if it's a dollar."

you really do just eat up the am airwaves, don't you? what's it like to let three college drop outs do your thinking for you?

last year social security did take in less in taxes than it paid out. it made up the difference in interest payments. it did not in any way add to our debt.

and we could not have sold off the treasury bonds. they are non-marketable, but they are still backed by the full faith and credit of the united states. however, the assumption is that we would have paid other creditors first had we decided to default on our debt and social security would have got the short end of the stick.

but the fact remains social security has not ever added one dime to our debt, and is in fact barred by law from doing so.

Irrelevant to the conversation, and you know that.

You think that just by retaining the name, that means Medicare can't be ended.

And you're serious...

 

Remember Rabbi is the same person who

- Thinks a good solution for people without health insurance is using Power of attorney.  

- That black people can't be good leaders simply because of their skin color  

- And that an increase of 10% of people to 15% of people is somehow NOT an increase of 50%

So yeah, only caring that its still called Medicare is right up Rabbis alley.

 

Shockingly you cannot support anything you write there.
In fact Ryan's plan assures that Medicare can continue to offer medical insurance to elderly people who would otherwise find themselves without care. Unlike Obama's plan, which will cut reimbursements to the point where no doctor will accept it.

 

Without care??????

Only if Republicans end Medicare.

You need to do a lot more reading.

Obama's plan does not cut reimbursements to doctors to the point where will not accept patients. It cut out the bonus 14% or so that was in Medicare Advantage, but that bonus was over and above the actual cost of the procedure. It was free money to doctors. It's now gone and doctors get paid the going rate. Why do you hate that?

Also, Ryan's plan does NOT allow Medicare to continue to offer insurance. Quite the opposite, as it provides no insurance at all. The consumer will have to go out and find a company that will accept them into a plan. They will have to negotiate a deal and sign a contract. Only then will the government issue some money to the insurance company. Money that is by design LESS than the cost of the plan.

in what world do you think you've tried to explain anything? you tell me that social security has added to our debt - i tell you that by law it can't and hasn't.

you try to pretend that by loaning the government money it's contributing to the debt. i point out that it doesn't matter who bought the bonds, the buyer is in no way contributing to the debt.

you try to pretend that social security is somehow borrowing money to pay its benefits - again, i point out that by law it can't.

whether the bonds are marketable or not doesn't really matter. they're backed by the full faith and credit of the united states, and unless we choose to destroy that credit there isn't a problem.

oh, and one more thing - unless social security has the liquid assets to pay benefits - it can't. it cannot borrow money in any way, shape, or form.

now if you want to say that social security is unsustainable as is, or that it is in need of reform to make sure that the day it can't pay benefits never comes is a different argument.

the one you are making just doesn't hold water.

do some research. you'll find that you are not, in fact, right.
