James P. Gorman, a 6-foot-2 Australian, recently took up boxing
lessons, in keeping with some of the trappings of his Midtown
Manhattan office. On one wall, opposite an inspirational poem by
Rudyard Kipling ("The Thousandth Man"), hangs a photograph of
Elvis Presley sparring with Muhammad Ali.

"I have a lot of respect for Ali," says Gorman.

As the new chief executive of Morgan Stanley, an investment bank
that narrowly escaped the financial smackdown that destroyed many
of its competitors, Gorman may have to get ready for some
fisticuffs.

He is tasked with overhauling a firm that put a primacy on
high-risk trading under his predecessor, John J. Mack, and one that
has spent the last several years often riven by factional disputes
and internal debates over strategy.

Under Mack, Morgan Stanley made errant mortgage bets and
commercial property gambles that cost it billions of dollars and
almost destroyed it. The firm was saved by a $10 billion bailout
from the federal government, since repaid, and by Asian investors
who wrested a large stake in the firm in exchange for cash.

During Mack's tenure, from 2005 to the end of last year, the
stock price fell 32 percent. And the firm, which will celebrate its
75th anniversary this year, is expected to announce this week the
first annual loss in its history.

"There is no question there have been rough spots," Gorman
said, in his first interview since becoming chief executive on Jan.
1. "We have had periods of management turmoil, misplaced trading
positions. We have invested in real estate at the wrong end of the
market. Clearly there were some mistakes made, but you can't be in
a complex global bank and not have mistakes."

He added that the bank now had "a sense of clarity about what
we want to be" -- and that it wouldn't be trading with large
amounts of its own capital. "We are a very focused investment
bank," he said, "very client-centered."

Gorman, 51, will have to prove that the steadier, more
diversified bank he hopes to build -- with less megatrading and more
advisory work for clients -- can still take on more aggressive Wall
Street titans like Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase, rivals that
thus far have navigated the crisis more successfully.

Gorman says that Morgan will eventually begin taking bigger
risks and wagering more money to do so, but that it will avoid big,
concentrated bets on complex products that few people understand --
and that have the potential to blow up an institution.

"We are still taking risks," he says, but "we will not have
the outsize risk positions that will endanger the firm."

Still, some analysts remain tentative about Morgan Stanley's
prospects in a financial landscape littered with corporate wreckage
and dominated by a handful of wily survivors. While the firm's
traditional investment banking franchise has emerged strongly from
the crisis -- topping JPMorgan and Goldman in some of its businesses
-- it has shrunk its fixed-income division and taken piles of money
off the table in its broader institutional securities business.

Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
notes that Morgan Stanley has about $17 billion in capital
committed to its institutional securities business, compared with
his estimate of around $40 billion at Goldman and $33 billion at
JPMorgan.

Over the last few years, "they seemed to hang back from
risk-taking even at times when they could get paid richly,"
Moszkowski says.

"Then they pushed themselves forward when the party was already
ending," he adds. "Morgan Stanley lagged again last year. The net
result is they zigged when they should have zagged. There is an
issue in that they have fallen behind their peers, though I believe
they can resolve it."

Gorman's arrival at Morgan Stanley is, of course, heavily
informed by Mack's track record. Mack, who is staying on as
chairman and will continue to occupy his old office, inspired
fierce loyalty among his traders but ultimately drew mixed reviews
as a manager.

Mack, 65, had spent most of his career at Morgan Stanley and was
one of the architects of its 1997 merger with the brokerage firm
Dean Witter. The chief executive of Dean Witter, Philip J. Purcell,
outmaneuvered Mack for control of Morgan in the following years.
Mack left in 2001, ushering in an era of pitched battles between
Purcell supporters and Mack loyalists who remained.

After much to-and-fro, Purcell -- who pushed for less risk-taking
at the firm but delivered lackluster financial results -- was forced
out in 2005, and Mack made a triumphant return. And that is where
the real debate on his performance begins, especially in light of
the outsize losses Morgan Stanley absorbed.

"John really did do most of the things that the shareholders
and some of the retired employees were hoping he would do," says
Robert G. Scott, a former senior executive at the firm who was
among those who successfully agitated for Mack's return. "The CEO
is critical, but the people who are executing the strategy in
various business units have a tremendous responsibility for the
results, and the seeds for that underperformance were sown before
John took over."

Others, however, have a harsher view.

"What's the legacy of John Mack?" asks William D. Cohan, a
former investment banker and the author of "House of Cards," a
best seller about the financial crisis. "He nearly lost the firm
by taking big risks. In the Mack era, a dirty little secret is that
had they stuck to Purcell, they would not almost have gone out of
business in 2008."

Mack acknowledges some regrets about the course of his career --
that he never consummated a proposed merger of Morgan Stanley's
asset management business with BlackRock, which has become one of
the world's largest money managers, and that he never flushed out
more senior managers when he returned in 2005.

"There were things you just didn't know until you asked
specific questions," he says. "Certain positions were a lot older
than anyone ever told me. When you come into an organization, you
need fresh eyes. You don't need anyone who can defend what's been
in place in the past."

But on his legacy he is clear, he says: he changed the firm for
the better.

Passionate, emotional, intuitive and a former bond trader, Mack
worked hard to restore swagger and confidence to traders and others
who believed that Morgan Stanley lost its way under Purcell.

After returning, Mack boasted of his renewed appetite for risk
and pushed the firm into fashionable areas like subprime mortgages,
commercial real estate and leveraged lending. To emulate other
banks like Goldman, he advocated using the firm's own capital to
pursue bigger, hairier trades.

That strategy worked at first -- 2006 was a record year -- but
Morgan Stanley's swashbuckling wasn't backed up by adequate risk
controls, a reality embodied by the biggest trading loss in its
history and an event that more than any other may mark the Mack
era.

The loss came at a specialized trading shop housed inside the
firm and run by a man named Howie Hubler, then in his mid-30s.
Hubler's 50-person team correctly wagered $1.4 billion that the
subprime mortgage market was weak and would become progressively
worse, insight that paid off in 2006 and into early 2007.

But to protect itself against possible losses on that trade, the
team bought contracts that would enable it to profit if the
subprime sector stabilized. Those latter bets proved extremely
vulnerable, and as the mortgage market imploded -- setting off one
of the worst economic crises in American history -- Morgan Stanley
was trapped. The firm ended up losing $10 billion on the wagers.

A person familiar with the trade, who requested anonymity
because of contractual obligations that prevent him from speaking
about the firm, said the unit was never a rogue operation and that
many of Morgan Stanley's leaders were aware of its activities and
approved of them, including the group's proposals to wind down the
position.

At the same time, the firm was slammed by losses on direct
commercial property investments, like Crescent Real Estate, a $6.5
billion portfolio of urban office properties that it bought at the
peak of the boom in 2007. In November, facing defaults on borrowing
tied to the portfolio, Morgan Stanley surrendered it to Barclays
Capital. For the first three quarters of 2009, Morgan Stanley
booked real estate losses of $2.1 billion.

Mack says the firm took on such risks because everyone else on
Wall Street was doing it, too. "Did I have too much leverage?" he
says. "Yes. But the whole industry did."

He says that some of the trading positions were put on the books
in the Purcell years and that Morgan Stanley's chief risk officer
didn't report directly to him, which prevented crucial information
from reaching his office.

Mack responded to the trading debacle by ousting his protégé,
Zoe Cruz, the firm's co-president, who was in charge of the
institutional securities group.

In an unusual gesture on Wall Street, Mack has taken some
responsibility for his mistakes by forgoing a bonus for the last
three years. In congressional testimony last week, he said he was
an advocate of greater regulation because of the threats to the
financial system that he saw during the crisis.

He also shuttered all but one of Morgan Stanley's proprietary
trading desks and ousted some senior executives in its real estate
businesses. And, rather than bowing to regulatory demands that he
sell the firm, Mack strengthened Morgan Stanley's balance sheet by
selling a chunk of the firm to the Asian investors. That move, as
well as taxpayer largess in the form of federal bailout money, kept
it from collapsing.

Yet, for all of this, Mack arguably made another mistake after
the worst of the crisis' initial stages had passed -- by dialing
back risk-taking too far. Rivals like Goldman Sachs took advantage
of the reduced number of competitors to ring up record trading
profits last year, windfalls that Morgan Stanley missed out on.

"We were probably too conservative," concedes Mack. "But we
had not built out enough of a platform in sales and trading."

Waiting in the wings as all of these financial dramas played out
was Gorman, a former lawyer from Melbourne who was one of Mack's
first major hires when he returned to the firm in 2005.

Cerebral, circumspect and analytical, Gorman's style contrasts
with Mack's brasher, more intuitive approach -- a telling reminder
of just how much the financial crisis has traumatized Morgan
Stanley and the extent to which the bank's board, and Mack himself,
recognize the need for a calm, risk-conscious hand at the tiller.

In 1987, after receiving an M.B.A. from Columbia's Graduate
School of Business, Gorman joined the consulting giant McKinsey,
where, among other things, he was a member of the financial
services practice. In 1999, David H. Komansky, then the chief
executive of Merrill Lynch, recruited Gorman as its marketing
chief.

Gorman describes Komansky -- who, not unlike Mack, is a
larger-than-life figure -- as his first mentor.

"He told me: One, stay grounded; two, don't underestimate the
importance of personal relationships inside and outside the firm,"
Gorman says of Komansky. "And three, if someone is doing the wrong
thing, no matter how big a producer they are, they are out."

Gorman eventually oversaw Merrill's global private client
business and made many changes he would later employ at Morgan
Stanley -- segmenting the market and focusing on wealthier clients.
A former Merrill colleague described him as a quick study and
unafraid of internal battles with Komansky's successor, E. Stanley
O'Neal.

"He was not always focused on the political ramifications of
something," says this person, who requested anonymity because of
contractual obligations that prevent him from speaking about
Merrill. "I watched him in a tug of war with O'Neal and not let it
go. If he thinks something is right, he is going to dig in. This is
a good thing."

Friction with O'Neal primed Gorman to accept Mack's invitation
in 2005, a call that came partially at the recommendation of
Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock.

"He understands how to bring culture to an organization," says
Fink. "He can talk about the high-level strategy and understands
the details of the business."

At Morgan Stanley, Gorman led the global wealth management
division and tied up a number of loose ends from the Dean Witter
merger: replacing 27 of the top 30 managers, removing the 2,000
least productive financial advisers, unifying all of the firm's
retail business under one name, streamlining technology systems,
overhauling marketing and focusing on wealthier clients.

Gorman worked from Morgan Stanley's offices in Purchase, N.Y.
Once a week, Mack, who lives nearby in Rye, would go to the gym and
then stop by for an 8:30 a.m. meeting with Gorman.

In addition to having valuable face time with Mack, Gorman also
lavished praise on his boss: In Mack's office hangs a printed,
signed and framed e-mail message from Gorman, richly complimenting
Mack for his leadership during the financial crisis.

Such overt gestures haven't given Gorman the reputation of being
a toady. Many around the office describe him as "nice" and
"decent." Or, as one of his senior colleagues puts it, Gorman is
"definitely not a slimeball."

After the trading losses in 2007, Gorman became co-president.
The firm also put him in charge of thinking about long-term
strategy with its chief financial officer. During the crisis,
Gorman argued forcefully for a big strategic shift, with an
emphasis on cutting complex products and expanding retail brokerage
services.

To that end, Gorman pushed Morgan Stanley to pay $2.75 billion
last year to acquire a 51 percent stake in Smith Barney, the big
brokerage firm owned by Citigroup, another struggling financial
behemoth. Morgan Stanley hopes to take full control of Smith Barney
by 2014. The takeover gives it about 18,000 financial advisers and
one of the biggest wealth management businesses in the world.

According to Howard Chen, an analyst at Credit Suisse, history
may decide that Morgan Stanley bought Smith Barney "for a song."
The deal was certainly transformative. The retail business now
makes up 35 percent of Morgan Stanley's total revenue (compared
with 57 percent for its traditional institutional business), up
from about a quarter share before the deal.

Whatever its long-term merits, the deal did little to reverse
Morgan Stanley's sagging fortunes. Around the middle of last year,
with the share price lagging, Mack confirmed previous plans to step
down. Gorman won the race to succeed him, in part because the
firm's board, which voted unanimously for him, was impressed by his
strategic abilities and work he had done turning around the retail
business.

The board liked that Gorman wanted to strengthen Morgan
Stanley's institutional securities group and reduce risk-taking,
says Robert Kidder, a director.

"We concluded that James was decisive, strategic and had
knowledge of a range of the firm's activities," says Kidder. "We
believed he was the kind of person who would build a strong and
strategic team over time."

According to another person familiar with the board's thinking,
who requested anonymity because the deliberations were
confidential, Gorman's calm demeanor offered a marked and welcome
break from Mack's more volatile temperament.

Despite his embrace of plain-vanilla retail enterprises, Gorman
says that the firm's core business remains its investment banking
and institutional sales and trading -- and that the company's
recovery won't be complete until those businesses are nursed back
to health. To buttress its risk management capabilities, Morgan
Stanley has started what it calls Project Phoenix, which will
measure and monitor proper risk-return ratios across the company.

Some analysts still have concerns. Institutional Risk Analytics,
a research firm, recently gave Morgan Stanley's shares a negative
rating "because of the bank's poor financial performance, low
levels of tangible common equity and failure to make any
significant disclosure regarding off-balance-sheet exposures."

Morgan Stanley says that it has healthy levels of common equity
and that it discloses details of its off-balance-sheet exposures.
It points out that three other analysts upgraded their ratings of
the firm this month.

Some analysts wonder whether Gorman has the investment banking
and trading chops to rally the bank's core institutional troops, or
whether his resemblance to Purcell -- who also began his career at
McKinsey and rose to prominence in retail brokerage -- may be too
limiting.

"I no more or less resemble Phil Purcell than any 5,000 people
here," says Gorman. "And a lot of people ran brokerages -- Sandy
Weill, Jamie Dimon, David Komansky."

The money manager Barton Biggs, who spent 30 years at Morgan
Stanley before leaving in 2003 to run his own company, says he
thinks the mood at Morgan is upbeat. "People respect Gorman as
being a different person than John," he says. "He is not a
mingler. He is not going to walk the trading floor, slapping backs.
But he is a first-rate intellect and he impresses with his
organization and his thoughtfulness."

Standing in his office recently, Gorman flips through sheets of
corporate contacts he has made since his McKinsey days. He
describes the back-to-back breakfasts, coffees and dinners he will
be having with hedge fund managers and corporate titans over the
next few weeks.

"This is a period of time when you are dealing with a lot of
complicated constituencies -- regulators, shareholders, legislators,
politicians, the media," he says. "There are a lot of things in
flux and you have to feel comfortable dealing with a lot of
complexity, which I do."

As Gorman continues to get his stride, he will have Mack peering
over his shoulder as chairman for at least the next two years. Mack
says he's looking forward to spending more time at his Tuscan
vineyard and shows off a picture of himself standing beside Cher
backstage in Las Vegas, as well as other mementos from a 40-year
career. "I really like my new role," he says. "I didn't come to
work until 9:30 today!"

But some analysts wonder that if things turn sour, will Gorman
find himself isolated in an institution where Mack's constituency
is still powerful?

"Listen, this would not work if I wasn't his man," says
Gorman. "We have a terrific relationship."

On a recent afternoon, the two men posed in Gorman's doorway,
arms around each other's shoulders, demonstrating their
camaraderie.

"We do this every day," says Gorman, joking, while Mack smiles
beside him.

Gorman acknowledges, however, that the alternative -- fighting
with Mack -- would be a terrifying prospect.

"I would not box John," he says. "He has big shoulders."
