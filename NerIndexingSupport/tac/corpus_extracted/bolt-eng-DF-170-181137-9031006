yeah its pretty funny how for the third time in a row in the Big Ben era,that The Steelers are going to be donning their white jerseys.this is the second time out of three that they had no choice.the first time of course THEY were the home team and chose to wear the whites since they were a wild card team and wore the whites the whole time in the playoffs winning all three games not wanting to change what was working.

Thats why the steelers are a class organization.at least THEY were not A-holes like the fagboys and did not go with the moronic logic that since they lost the superbowl in their dark jerseys,to start wearing their whites in all their home games.     thats one reason i hate them is you have to see them wear the same damn white Uni's all the time at home or on the road since most teams are normal and wear their dark uni's at home.

funny how they have forgotten the white uni's did them no good in the two superbowl losses to the steelers in the 70's.   so much for their logic of wearing the whites in all their home games.

I'M not complaining !!!!

 

If athletes (in-general) are superstitious-enough to think something (inconsequential) gives them an "edge"....and, they're winning.....no prob !!

Since their last SB, they seem to have had a better "road"-record....from what I'm used to hearing (without dropping-back & checking-out their exact-record). If it's a matter-of-Pride (winning, on-the-road).... especially when their Opponent is "baptizing" a new stadium  .....that one consistent is their jersey-color....and, I've seen them win a LOT o' big-ones, in those white-jerseys !!!!

yeah but lately they have lost all but one playoff game under Phillips while wearing the whites and again,thier logic is pretty moronic to wear whites in home games just cause they lost the superbowl in their dark jerseys.   since they have a better road record,that just again proves their logic is pathetic.   most other NFL teams wear their dark jerseys anyways.Like The Raiders and Chiefs for instance,those two teams for sure you'll never catch wearing their white unis at home.

"What's the prism through which you view sports?

The prism of team colors and city name?

The singular filter of athletic achievement?

A window on human interest, finding athletes you feel you can truly root for?

It's an interesting exploration. Why does one city cheer for its own accused steroid cheat yet degrade an accused visitor? Why do some stay loyal to a team even after it has moved and turned its back on its fan base? Why can you hate one player when he plays across the country and adore him as soon as he signs with your team?

And why does a person's vile behavior off the field become less relevant the more his team wins?

That brings us to Ben Roethlisberger, who is leading the Pittsburgh Steelers into the Super Bowl for the third time in his seven-year career." - Ann Killion

....And, it's lookin' like the Packers "get it"!!!

 
"As one would expect, the Packers weren't exactly eager to provide frank, direct answers to questions about if the Steelers' defense plays up to the edge of proper conduct -- and possibly over that edge.

After all, there's no reason to rile up any opponent at this stage (unless you're Jets coach Rex Ryan or one of his players) or to acknowledge if you're intimidated by an opponent.  

About the most revelatory statement came from Packers wide receiver Greg Jennings, when asked about the Steelers' propensity for big hits: "They're a team that really tries to get after you physically. We understand that."

HERE

 

 
 
 
Ridin'-the-pine with

Clay Matthews !!!!!!!!

 
" Both are disruptive playmakers with long, flowing hair and a shared alma mater.

They also are so close to one another as far as impacting games that initial reports Monday had Green Bay Packers outside linebacker Clay Matthews, not Steelers strong safety Troy Polamalu, winning NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors.

Polamalu, as it turned out, edged Matthew by the slimmest of margins, getting 17 first-place votes out of 50 among those on a nationwide Associated Press panel. Matthews received 15 first-place votes. "

 HERE 

 
 
 
 
" The day after the win over the Jets, the Steelers came to their practice facility for the usual Monday stuff, and the players were off on Tuesday while the coaching staff put together the game plan. That plan for the upcoming opponent  the Green Bay Packers  was introduced on Wednesday morning, and then it was a normal in-season week for the Steelers through the end of business on Friday.

The Steelers are experienced in the ways of the Super Bowl throughout all levels of the organization.

There will be curfews, but Tomlin has no interest in bed-check being the focal point of the day. This is a lifetime experience for these players, but it will turn out to be nothing but a painful memory if its handled as anything but a business trip. "

Scofflaws, BEGONE!!!!

THE STEELERS ARE IN TOWN!!!

 
"Imagine the Browns playing the Eagles in Pittsburgh. It's the first time the Steel City has hosted a Super Bowl, and Heinz Field has been open only two seasons.

That scenario begins to describe the nightmare some Dallas Cowboys fans are enduring this week as the Steelers prepare to play the Packers in Super Bowl XLV, a first for North Texas and two - year - old Cowboys Stadium.  

"It's going to be filled with the colors that I was raised to hate," said Cowboys fan Jack Dison, 24, a native of Tyler, Texas, whose mother taught him about the Steelers ' two Super Bowl victories over the Cowboys in Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIII. "If they do the Lambeau Leap, I'm going to go crazy."

This week is rubbing salt in the wound of fans of the blue and silver, who suffered through a tumultuous 6-10 season in 2010. "

 

 HERE 

 

     
 
 
Didn't the Packers also defeat the Cowboys twice to win the NFL Championship?

Why the hell would Cowboy fans hate either the Pack or Steelers?

Its not like the Redskins or Giants are in their house
 
 
 
Didn't the Packers also defeat the Cowboys twice to win the NFL Championship?

 

Could be...could be...but, it's only Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIII that really count, in Dallass-fans' eyes.

Be patient.

Maybe ONE day, people (outside Wisconsin) will speak of The Pack with the same reverence they reserve for THE STEELERS.

IT could happen..... for your great-grandchildren!!!!!

With Mr. Shaman, Steeler history starts with the hiring of Chuck Noll. Great accomplishments of the 1970's Steelers aside, ignoring the previous 45 years is moronic. we packer fans suffered through a 25 year drought of poor teams through the 70's 80's and part of the early 90's.

" The Steelers have a roster filled with players who have at least one Super Bowl ring, many with two, but that doesnt diminish their enthusiasm one bit.

This never gets old, said cornerback Ike Taylor. I am fortunate and blessed. This is my third trip in eight years. Flozell Adams has been playing in the league for 13 years and has never had the chance to go to the Super Bowl. I told him from training camp on  we are going to get you back home to the Super Bowl .

 

 

I hope he gets the opportunity to say "HEY!" to Jerry Jones !!

LOL !!!!!!

     

 

 What The Steelers Said 

 
OFFENSIVE TACKLE FLOZELL ADAMS

(on other players wearing Michigan State jerseys in his honor this week) That made me feel good. It makes me feel real good. I was happy about it; felt good that the players, the offensive line guys felt enough to be able to buy the jerseys and show appreciation as much as I appreciate them.

(on if hell be nervous on the day of the game) Yeah, I mean, Ive never experienced a Super Bowl. Theres always going to be some type of nervousness. I get nervous before mostly every game. Its not nervous as far as being scared of an opponent; its more of what Im going to do and how Im going to do it in whatever particular situations that come and everything like that. Being in the Super Bowl, Im sure its going to be a little bit of nervousness, but once you just start cracking helmets out there, its going to be like the same old thing. Youve just got to go out there and do the best you can.

(On how it feels to know his teammates want to win one for him) It feels good. You know, theres 20 something guys on this team that have already won a Super Bowl, but one is never enough.

***

SAFETY TROY POLAMALU

(on what it means to get to the Super Bowl with this current Pittsburgh team) You always look back on the experience after you win the game. Weve been fortunate enough to be in this game and not walk away when the confetti is not in black and gold. But that has everything to do with the experience. I dont know how you look back at this season, but to this point, its amazing. Its amazing that guys like James Farrior and Hines Ward, these cornerstones of our locker room, have led us to this point for a third time.

(on if he looks around the locker room and sees players who may be in their final year) Our strength has never been in our talent. Its always been in our virtues, of our hard work and most importantly our camaraderie, our humility and how we respect the game and respect our opponents. Thats something youth can never have. It takes a lot of experience. It takes a lot of chemistry, a lot of life experience to have that.

***

Wide Receiver Hines Ward

(On how much motivation they get from being the underdog) Thats not our motivation. Our motivation is to win the Lombardi Trophy, regardless of if were underdogs or not underdogs. Were not a flashy team. You still have to play the game regardless of if youre underdogs. Thats just part of the story and something to talk about. We as players, we dont make the odds. We still have to go out there and play the game. Weve been the underdogs kind of for the past two weeks it seems like. No one picked us. Coach (Bill) Cowher picked the Jets against us. It still doesnt matter to us. We still have to play the game.

It would be a consideration......but, this is the period (during which) Steelers -fans are cranking-up the presses for Sympathy Cards, for ( most-current competitor here ).

They say Patience Is A Virtue....but, Green Bay fans need not stress. We (long-ago) developed a standard-format for such publishing-needs.

probably the same response Bears fans had,the ones that were on drugs when they predicted they would not only go to the superbowl,but win it all.      

I wont be too surprised if my pick is wrong,that the Packers win and the steelers lose cause while I think the steelers will win,I do think it will be a close game with the steelers wining by three or less.Plus the steelers almost blew it against the cardinals.thanks to a penalty by the cardinals,they had "seven" chances for a touchdown in that game and they could not capitalize and had to settle for a field goal.they also got lucky when James Harrison made that interception at the goal line and ran it back a 100 yards for a touchdown.they got very lucky in that game.makes me cringe that their luck might run out this time.

Yeah, Skippy....that's what it was..... luck.....when Harrison dropped-back (into pass-coverage), rather-than rushing for a sack....like Warner was expecting.

Fear not. Once you grow-up (to be a big-boy ), you'll better-understand how the game's played.....maybe.

Eventually, you might learn that luck is nothing-more than being prepared for whatever might happen.

 Steelers Rookie Brown Overcomes Difficult Past 

 

 

Hey Im as much a Steeler fan as the next guy especially since i hate green bay,but he was just lucky that it was sloppy tackilng by the cardinals when he was running the ball back.He should have been tackled twice during that runback but because of sloppy tackling by the cards he scored. the way the steelers offense played at the goal line with seven chances that day to get it into the end zone,if he doesnt make it to the end zone and score the touchdown for them on defense like he did,i doubt the steelers would have won the game the way their offense could not execute when they got down to the goal line that time with SEVEN chances to get into the end zone.they really embarrased me as a steeler fan with that performance.

Like I say, Skippy.....ya' gotta be prepared to take your shots, when you get the opportunity.

Pittsburgh was.....Arizona wasn't.....End of story......

Yep... here they come. Excuses excuses excuses.

You got 2 calls go your way that shouldn't have, a no-call on an obvious facemask by Redman, and instigated an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty when it was OBVIOUS they tried to cheat on that punt by pushing a Packer into the ball. We then lost a starting reciever, or Star #1 and up and coming # cornerbacks and STILL won by Defensive power.

And you still lost because of 3 turnovers. Good defenses get them. Say luck all you want. Ben was being pressured all game long and making very bad plays and getting lucky sometimes, and unlucky all too often.

Next year? You think they'll be back next year? Good luck, you'll need it. Even I am not stupid enough to assume the Packers are an automatic shoe in for it.

But regardless. You need 7 more, just to catch up. I'd not be rubbing you nose in it so much if you weren't such a dick earlier. You whine as bad as a Viking's fan, just before he gives up for the season in week 5.
 
 
time for me to pay up.the steelers beat themselves in this game.you cant win games with costly penaltys and turnovers like they had.that penalty on that kickoff when they were down by only 7 points was costly.if not for that penalty,they have the ball at their 40 yard line in excellent field position and Rothlesberger isnt forced to throw the ball deep down the field and have it intercepted and run back for a touchdown.

then when they have the momentum,the turning point of the game for sure is that fumble by that running back. giving the packers excellent field position to score what turned out to be the deciding touchdown. oh well,at least they lost to a team that did not desert their longtime fans and move to another city such as the colts.lol.at least they beat the cardinals    

whom I hate for that reason.that cant be taken away from me.

hurts MUCH less to lose to the packers than it would have to lose to those hated Cardinals especially Kurt Warner for taking what used to be the Los angeles Rams to the superbowl in winning it all no less.grrrrr
