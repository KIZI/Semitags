BRASILIA, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- After a 176-percent increase between 2001 and
2007, Brazil's exports hit grinding snags.

Currency appreciation coupled with operational hitches have added insult to
injury inflicted by the ongoing global economic slowdown that reduced orders.

Despite the fact that the Brazilian government had resorted to several
institutional and non-institutional measures to bypass the barriers, Brazilian
exporters were still left disadvantaged compared with their peers in other
countries.

A Confederation of Brazilian Industry (CNI) survey has attributed the
disadvantage mostly to the strength of the Brazilian real, which had appreciated
45 percent in the past five years.

As many as 855 big export-oriented enterprises, or 82.2 percent, blamed real
appreciation. They were joined by 82.8 percent of medium-sized exporters and
84.7 percent of small exporters in the country.

Second on the blame list found by the survey for 2008 was customs bureaucracy,
which topped a 2002 CNI survey.

Pointing fingers were 41.5 percent of the big exporters, 46.7 percent of medium-
sized exporters and 33.8 percent of small exporters.

Though most still blame the high costs at ports, survey interviewees also blamed
red-tapery at ports and port facilities as playing a part in bottlenecking trade
flows, both out-bound and in-bound.

Exporters also blamed taxation for offsetting the competitive edge of Brazilian
exports.

On average, 30 percent of the respondents thought negatively of the country's
taxation system and policy.

Surveyed companies, big or small, considered it important for the government to
exempt taxes so as to stimulate export flows.

The survey also found that the authorities could do multiple things to get
export flows back on track.

Among those things was at least a government guidance on how to make the most of
available export funding without rendering Brazilian exports subject to anti-
dumping or countervailing investigations, because the government can help
clarify that the World Trade Organization regulations have been honored.
