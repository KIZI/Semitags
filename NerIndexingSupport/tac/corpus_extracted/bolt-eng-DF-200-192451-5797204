 
 
I think found a way to stop Islamic terrorism.
 
 
Okay we all know Muslims(Yes since to most people Terror=Islam) are deemed by the media to be the biggest threat to world peace, and that they are waging war on everyone in the world.

Okay well picture this Muslims from third world countries with no future feel threatened by everyone and feel they are the ones war is being waged on.

I'm British Muslim I see this from both sides and its pretty childish however thousands of people die because of this animal like 'lets wipe out the threat behavior'.

However there was a time when both the West and the East were at equilibrium in between the medieval dominance of Islam and the Modern Western dominance. It was the time of the Last Caliphate.

Now many people dont understand the Caliphate they see it as an Imperial tool of conquest however the Caliphate was abolished in 1924 at the end of the Empires game( If you dont include the American Empire   ).

The Caliphate is not a starting point for conquest its just at the time conquest was the norm, so you ask why the caliphate why now?

The Caliphate is an Installation of an Islamic superstate free from racial/linguistic divide and in many respects a welfare state An Islamic superstate would give the Muslim Community the ability to have a greater say in UN or even be part of the security council since I believe the Muslims Interests are grossly underrepresented in the UN, thus Terrorism being the only way many see as attracting attention. Muslims account for 1/5 of the world populous yet have almost negligible political influence.

I believe this Caliphate does not even have to be a Nation merely an alliance of Muslim countries and countries with Muslim majorities, to allow for a better representation of Muslims in the global stage.

Remember I explicitly say this not fact its opinion I'm not saying it might.
 
 
This is America: "See that land, see that oil? Let's go bomb them."

Caliphate or no Caliphate. If you've got oil and resources, you better watch out or else America will bomb you.

True thus you agree America is the reason for Islamic terrorism?
 
 
 
True thus you agree America is the reason for Islamic terrorism?

 

Yes.
 
 
Hmmm, but surely you're in favour of the invasion of Iraq (Saddam was a horrible man who killed Muslims) and that of Afghanistan (Al Qaeda was very oppressive)? The issue being the puppet governments installed by the West.
 
 
We all know this is a War on Islam rather than a War on Terror. If they were so concerned about the Taliban, Condoleezza Rice and UNOCAL wouldnt have done lucrative oil deals when Taliban was in power - they werent so concerned about womens rights then were they.
 
 
Want to know what caused Islamic Terrorism?

Islam...
 
 
Pan-Islamist dream? The Muslim world isn't as "united" as you are foolish enough to think.
 
 
Religion is just a conspiracy theory anyway and 9/11 was an inside job.

Nope Since it Killed more PEOPLE(Muslims and Non-muslims are people). Yes British Imperialism was the root cause of almost all world problems today its true but no one admits it.

I genuinely can't see every muslim state openly co-operating with each other; think Saudi Arabia and Iran for example, just like Christian/Western countries struggle to co-operate with each other; think USA and Russia, both World Wars were started by quarreling Europeans!

And as for muslims turning to terrorism, I highly doubt this is out of a drive to make the Islamic voice a louder one in the UN, or at least I have never heard the Jihadists say this in their pre-suicide videos.
 
 
 
It used to be and it will be again.

 

Really? I don't remember Indonesia ever being part of the caliphate(s)?
 
 
 
This is America: "See that land, see that oil? Let's go bomb them."

Caliphate or no Caliphate. If you've got oil and resources, you better watch out or else America will bomb you.

 

True.

Unfortunately the whole world is obsessed with us Middle-Eastern people, ever since our ancient origins for economic, religious and military reasons.

Sometimes I wish it was another part of the world that had the religiously significant land and oil.

Imagine how much more peaceful the Middle-East would be then....
 
 
Nonsense, because in countries that are 99.9% muslim there are Terrorist attacks on daily basis, so a caliphate wouldnt be a solution by any means.
 
 
 
We all know this is a War on Islam rather than a War on Terror. If they were so concerned about the Taliban, Condoleezza Rice and UNOCAL wouldnt have done lucrative oil deals when Taliban was in power - they werent so concerned about womens rights then were they.

 

Could you explain the lucrative deals ?

people in the west wouldn't take to this idea because they want islam to have less of a platform/influence.
 
 
 
Nonsense, because in countries that are 99.9% muslim there are Terrorist attacks on daily basis, so a caliphate wouldnt be a solution by any means.

 

Actually those countries have terrorists in them who think there government is an Ally when America only has two allies Wall street and Israel.
 
 
 
people in the west wouldn't take to this idea because they want islam to have less of a platform/influence.

 

But Islam having more Influence would reduce the need for terrorism.

No.
The problem is the shia / sunni thing.

Google will do it for you. Kinda need to revise  
 
 
 
Really? I don't remember Indonesia ever being part of the caliphate(s)?

 

Yes actually the South east Asian Khanates where part of Islamic Union during late 1500's but not for long Damn Spanish.

The only thing it comes up with is a rumoured deal, described by 2 frenchies, between the US government, enron and the Taliban.
 
 
 
But Islam having more Influence would reduce the need for terrorism.

 

but what do islamic terrorists want? if I'm not mistaken, their mentality is "believe what we believe or we'll kill you given the chance". What difference is more dialogue/discussion with representatives of normal islam going to make there? The west is never going to take to islam, we've practically had enough of christianity now so islam has got no hope. They'd have to kill everyone in the west.

You are allowed to have more than one Calpihs, so ur right in theory, but it would be more stable and preferable to have one.

What "Islamic Union"? I thought the caliphate at that time was the Ottoman Empire which definitely didn't include anything in the east?  
 
 
 
for you to stop killing our people

 

You ?
Our people ? Our people as in the people who killed 3000 on the streets of new york, or the ones who inspire Muslims to shoot 13 army officers at a texas base ?
 
 
Y'know islam isn't the only problem.
Look at the massacre in Norway earlier this year. Christian extremist.

Let's stop with the fingerpointing here, I haven't killed anyone. Neither has 99% of "us".

Y'know islam isn't the only problem.
Look at the massacre in Norway earlier this year. Christian extremist.

 

You mean the one that wasn't a Christian extremist, the left wing media said that to rub our noses in the fact that it wasn't Islamic terrorism. He was a far-right nutjob who did nothing to help the cause of any legitimate right-wing organisation.
 
 
 
You ?
Our people ? Our people as in the people who killed 3000 on the streets of new york, or the ones who inspire Muslims to shoot 13 army officers at a texas base ?

 

We can play that game forever, what of the thousands of nameless who were killed in Iraq/Afghanistan/Pakistan by Western armies?

Oh yeah, definitely comparable on a world scale...

12.000 to be precise in Iraq, since 2003.

Let's stop with the fingerpointing here, I haven't killed anyone. Neither has 99% of "us".

 

no, if every muslim is responsible for what a couple of muslims do, then YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAQ & AFGHANISTAN etc

no, if every muslim is responsible for what a couple of muslims do, then YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAQ & AFGHANISTAN etc

 

at what point did I say that?

I even went to the effort of separating islamic terrorists from normal muslims in my original post. You didn't even read it did you?
You are displaying a terrorist mentality here.

My people? Dude, what are you talking about.

Oil = War
 
 
 
you ?
Our people ? Our people as in the people who killed 3000 on the streets of new york, or the ones who inspire muslims to shoot 13 army officers at a texas base ?

 

what about the 1 million iraqis that died since 2003
 
 
 
no, if every muslim is responsible for what a couple of muslims do, then YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAQ & AFGHANISTAN etc

 

Who says all muslims are responsible for things a couple of muslims do.
The fact is that all terrorist attacks in countries like iraq and pakistan are done by muslims.
 
 
 
Nope Since it Killed more PEOPLE(Muslims and Non-muslims are people). Yes British Imperialism was the root cause of almost all world problems today its true but no one admits it.

 

Saddam killed up to 2,000,000 people and had an even worse son lined up to take over after him; the highest death toll estimate of the invasion of Iraq is just over 1,000,000-Not good either, but I think it was the lesser of the two evils.

Not really the British empire has largely helped it's subjects thanks to the level of infrastructure it built and modern medicines etc.
 
 
 
If you've got OIL then the West will bomb you. It's the lifeblood of the Western Industrialised economies.

Lol, look at what happened to Iraq`s oil after the invasion. The only country profited from the war in this sense is Russia.

Does this level of ignorance take years of practice or do you get a kick out of hating the West?

Palestine-Jews land since antiquity; Jews bought land, angry Arabs attack them, the Jews fight back.

Not terrorism, by genocide and other war crimes.

Stop attacking civilians (school siege the girls were raped and shot, the boys shot)

Saddam who killed 2,000,000 and had a first-in-line successor who went around Bagdad looking for women to rape before having them torn apart my his dogs, was removed

Stop attacking a better equiped power in the hope that pictures of colateral damage will be splashed across Western media outlets.

I don't know enough about this incident to comment; a tragedy nonetheless.

Jews brought NO LAND! AND WHY DID ISRAELIS KILL OUR OWN BRITISH TROOPS WHEN ATTACKING PALESTINE???

NO GIRLS WERE RAPED IN THAT SCHOOL!!! AGAIN U QUESTION THE ACTS OF INDIVIDUALS WHILE IGNORING THE MASSACRE AND MASS RAPE OF A STATE (40 MILLION PEOPLE AFFECTED)

No. Read the clash of Civilisations by Samuel Huntington.
Our civilisation is based on Christian jewish values. That doesn`t mean the churches are full on sundays.
 
 
It's in the interest of the US and friends to keep the middle east fragmented and under their thumb.
For that reason, they'll keep propping up the various dictatorships which more or less do as they say.
It's no surprise that this pisses off the locals, who are well aware of what is going on.

There's also the Sunni/Shia angle, which is a major cause of problems in places like Iraq, Syria and Bahrain at the moment.

Not to mention the major political divides between secularism versus theocracy.

"Stopping Islamic terrorism" is neither possible nor the top priority at the moment.
There are severe political problems which will need to be addressed over the coming decades first.

The Jews bought the land (read a history book or failing that Wikipedia); well the Jews wanted to have an independent state and the British had imprisoned many young men on the island of Cyprus without trial, plus the British had had their arms twisted by the Arab leaders to stop Jewish immigration to that area.

School girls were raped (The mass rape was planned; one of the terrorists acted with, "humanity" and shot a girl to prevent her experiencing the horrors to come), forensic evidence has shown at least 100 of the people were burned to death.

I'd be fine with Chechnyan independence, by laying siege to a school and commiting terrible acts is not the way to do it.
 
 
 
And im not british.

 

You really Dutch?

*Islamic terrorism.
 
 
Yeah, because Islamic States all agree with each other so readily. Please, do you honestly think the worlds billions Muslims would untie under one banner? You have to be joking. Every Islamic nation does things it's own way and thinks it's right. And besides that, what exactly are you proposing, some sort of International Islamic Union? Can you not see the down sides to that? There's nothing stopping them doing it, they just don't want to, it would serve no purpose. Oh, and FYI, Islam has never been dominant in any time period, just dominant in it's locality.
 
 
 
*Islamic terrorism.

 

Just out of interest, would you consider members of the IRA during their militant years catholic terrorists? I realise they had a nationalist cause but so too do many Islamic fundamentalists, trying to remove western influence as the IRA did English.

The fact these terrorists quote Koran verses and martyrdom for 'Allah' infers there are religious motives behind their attacks. The IRA had no religious motives to their attacks at all. Not all the IRA were religious and not all of the IRA were catholic.
 
 
 
....Really?

However there was a time when both the West and the East were at equilibrium in between the medieval dominance of Islam and the Modern Western dominance. It was the time of the Last Caliphate.

Now many people dont understand the Caliphate they see it as an Imperial tool of conquest however the Caliphate was abolished in 1924 at the end of the Empires game( If you dont include the American Empire   ).

The Caliphate is not a starting point for conquest its just at the time conquest was the norm, so you ask why the caliphate why now?

I believe this Caliphate does not even have to be a Nation merely an alliance of Muslim countries and countries with Muslim majorities, to allow for a better representation of Muslims in the global stage.

 

You're right, the Islamic world does need a Caliph to unite it. But you see for there to be a line of Caliphs there has to be a Prophet.

Prophecy of the Holy Prophet
Prophethood shall remain among you as long as God wills. He will bring
about its end and follow it with Khilafat on the precepts of prophethood for as long
as He wills and then bring about its end. Kingship shall then follow to remain as
long as God wills and then come to an end. There shall then be tyranny which shall
remain as long as God wills and come to an end upon His decree. There will then
emerge Khilafat on the precepts of Prophethood (Musnad-i-Ahmad).

Also, what the Muslim world needs right now more than a Caliph is the Second Coming of Jesus, the Imam Mahdi to revive Islam. This was a prophecy of The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

For there to be peace in the Islamic world and end to Muslim extremists, it is vital that Muslims accept The Promised Messiah of the age who has come to revive and reform them. Indeed he has come and there is a Khalifa in the Muslim world today. Those who have accepted The Promised Messiah have become an united, organised, faithful, pious and righteous community.

You want a good way to stop extremists. Here is a tip,

STOP MAKING THREADS LIKE THIS AND JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE!

Thats not very nice.
 
 
couple of things, this thread title made me laugh, just a quiet night in online and the solution to one of the world's major problems pops into the OP's head :P

also, the poster who commented saying something about "our people". i would never consider myself to have any real emotional attachment to the majority of people who you could say were similar to me, ie western, white, living in a christian country. i don't know if it's just me as i'm a quiet person and keep myself to myself, but can anyone shed any light on why most muslims i know refer to other muslims, who they have no connection to as "our people"? not **** stirring at all, it really baffles me.

When the "them" is so prevalent and as antipathies develop, it becomes easier to think of the "us".

makes sense i suppose. but do you think that could probably be a vicious circle then? "our people" makes non-muslims think "oh, they think they're a separate people to everyone else", which makes muslims feel outsiders and so on...
 
 
where does islamic terrorism come from? From islamic teachings? From jewish teachings? From christian teachings?

where does the "extremist" element come from? do any of you muslims know?

You're right, the Islamic world does need a Caliph to unite it. But you see for there to be a line of Caliphs there has to be a Prophet.

Prophecy of the Holy Prophet
Prophethood shall remain among you as long as God wills. He will bring
about its end and follow it with Khilafat on the precepts of prophethood for as long
as He wills and then bring about its end. Kingship shall then follow to remain as
long as God wills and then come to an end. There shall then be tyranny which shall
remain as long as God wills and come to an end upon His decree. There will then
emerge Khilafat on the precepts of Prophethood (Musnad-i-Ahmad).

Also, what the Muslim world needs right now more than a Caliph is the Second Coming of Jesus, the Imam Mahdi to revive Islam. This was a prophecy of The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

that's what I find so amusing and post about this topic on tsr.... both christians and musilms are awaiting the return of christ to save thier religion and followers. Where in the quran does it say that jesus of nazareth will return as the messiah of the muslims and do x,y and z in the name of islam. What is the definitive verse?

I find it strange and amusing that muslims harping on about the quran being the only religous text with unchanged words etc and then harp on about science, logic and rationality in the quran, blah, blah, blah........ and when it comes to the main issue, the messiah (taken to be jesus christ, who is mentioned quite a bit in the quran)... the word of god suddenly goes quiet and mysterious on this issue.... why do muslims believe jesus will return and do x,y and z in the name of islam? Where does it say this in the quran?

Surely this story of jesus as the messiah is somethign christian converts to islam have taken over to make themselves less homesick!

I'm questioning why musilms have adopted the prophet of the israelites (as stated in your quran) as teh islamic messiah and the saviour of islam? The quran mentions jesus quite a bit but nothing really about him as the muslim messiah. Me thinks this is something the muslim leaders have stolen from teh christians.

Jesus will never return to this earth in physical form. He was just a human and a Prophet and Messenger.

What the Qur'an and the Hadith mean by the second coming of Jesus is that a Messiah and Prophet will come only in the form of Jesus and with the same mission, the revival and reformation of the people.

Jesus came for the Jews.
The Promised Messiah (second coming of Jesus) has come for the Muslims and all peoples and religions to unite all religions as Islam is a universal and final religion.

This is the relevant quote:

The Prophet Muhammad (saw) foretold. ‘By Him in Whose hands is my life, the son of Mary will soon appear among you. He will administer justice. He will break the Cross, kill the swine, abolish war, distribute wealth, but no one will accept it’ (Bukhari)

Son of Mary does not mean Jesus himself, it means second coming of Jesus, in another man who will be like Jesus. Also in the above quote, a lot of it is metaphors. Don't take it all literally.

The quran mentions jesus quite a bit but nothing really about him as the muslim messiah. Me thinks this is something the muzzie leaders have stolen from teh christians.  

 

What?! A list of points you should consider:

1. Don't you believe that big portions of the Qur'an and Islam was taken from the Christians anyway. If not, then how do you as a Non-Muslim explain the similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an?!

2. The fact that the Messiah will return is nowhere near the most important aspect of Islam. It doesn't even come close, so I don't know where you got this from. This is a false assumption.

3. The Prophet Muhammad said that the Messiah will return, this matter is therefore non-negotiable for Muslims. It is obligatory to believe in it and a rejection of it constitutes apostasy from the religion of Islam.

I agree. Muslims have been misguided and fallen into error.

Jesus himself can never come back as he was human and has passed away. Also how can a Prophet of the Jews come for the Muslims? Not possible.

The truth is that someone will only come in the form of Jesus for the Muslims. Just as Jesus came to revive the Jews, The Muslim Messiah has come to revive the Muslims. They just need to accept him.

Yes I do, but the man who muslims refer to soley as the prophet of the israelites in the quran in quite a lot of verses, then becomes known as the messiah of islam (without actually being mentioned as such in the quran)... so in this sense the quran didn't take this part from the bible did they??

isn't the arrival of the messiah one of the biggest events in the history of the religion?

did he say that jesus christ of nazerath/prophet of israelites will return as teh messiah of islam? Did god tell him this? Why didn't he put this down in the quran, given that it is such a big issue...
 
 
 
Accordign to islamic belief he will return in his bodily form to earth from the heavens and fight in teh name of islam.

aren't there any quranic verses which refer to christ as teh islamic messiah?

 

The common Islamic belief is misguided. No one can or ever has returned in their physical form. I can prove from the Qur'an that Jesus has died and cannot come back.

I'm not sure about Qur'anic verse about Jesus as Muslim Messiah. But when Jesus is talked about being the Muslim Messiah, it means another person like Jesus will come for the Muslims. This is a point I cannot stress enough.

Jesus has died and will not come back, not for Jews, Christians or Muslims.

Only a person like Jesus, in the same form and with the same mission is prophesied to come for the Muslims.

are you muslim? why don't you believe in christ as teh messiah?

from what I've heard from muslims on here is that jesus was effectively "muslim" (as he was submitting to the will and word of allah), so that clears up the point about a jewish prophet being a muslim messiah....

No, Islam has been around for over a staggering 1400 years! Did we see Jesus Christ come down during this time? No. So how can this event be an integral part of the religion?! There are far more important parts of Islam, in fact the most important action and event of Islam is the procedure for prayer. The Qur'an does not tell us how to pray and yet the prayer is the most important event in the entire religion! Now are you going to question me why Allah didn't detail how to pray in the Qur'an?!

You can just keep going at this rate, at the end of the day, Allah decides what the Qur'an is. And a rejection of the Prophet's sayings is apostasy anyway. So what the Prophet has to say is as important as what the Qur'an says.

I am a Muslim. We believe that all Prophets effectively were basically Muslims, in that they submitted to Allah. But they were sent to different peoples, for different religions appropriate to the time and the people.

A Prophet for the Jews cannot come for the Muslims. A follower of Muhammad (saw) has come for the Muslims in the form of Jesus.

He died a natural death in India after completing his mission at the age of about 120 years.

He travelled to India and other places to find the lost sheep of the house of Israel which was his mission, this is in the bible.

Also the coming of the Messiah is one of the biggest event in the history of religion which is why eclipse of the sun and moon occurred as a sign of his arrival. Have a look at the website I gave you guys.

Muslims don't regard us as Muslims even though we follow the true Islam. Look at them, disunited and misguided. Then look at us, peaceful, loving, charitable, united and following the true Islam.

because islam is part of the abrahamic faiths and believe in the previous prophets and religions. The coming of the messiah is a massive part of these faiths and so also in islam; the arrival of the messiah is undoubtedly a massive part of the religious history (not in the exact sense of ‘history’… i.e. something that’s happened…)…

prayer has some linkage to the quran in that quranic verses are recited etc… there is no quranic linkage to the belief that jesus (prophet of the israelites) is the islamic messiah!

So your prophet said was that jesus (prophet of isralites) will return as the islamic messiah? How did he know? What did his followers ask him about this? The quran has to be taken as the word of god, but hadiths are sometimes rejected (even if agreed upon by the main scholars)

so rejecting the claim of muhammad that jesus is the islamic messiah is “apostasy” yet the matter of jesus returning as islamic messiah is not an integral part of the religion (as you’ve said)? You're not making sense.

What does apostasy mean?

What does apostasy mean?

 

What do you mean how did Muhammad know?! He is a Prophet and Messenger of Allah. And no, hadeeths are not just rejected. The fact that Jesus will return as the Messiah is by ijmaa (concensus) of the Muslim Nation and teh compnaions of the Prophet and the reports that say this are mutawaatir (narrated by so many people, that it is impossible for anyone to even think about falsifying them).

Apostasy is the process whereby a Muslim becomes Non-Muslim.
 
 
 
that's what I've heard. Mainstream islam condemn this sect as non-believers. What's the big deal if as you stated that the return of christ as teh islamic messiah is not an integral part of the islamic faith?

 

Well technically everything in Islam is integral, but you are elevating this topic to an unacceptable level, you are basically arguing that it's so important, that it must have been in the Qur'an. This is a misguided and abhorrent belief. And claiming that an ordinary human being is a Prophet of God like what the Qadianis/Ahmediyya did is instant apostasy and disbelief where even ignorance is not an excuse.
 
 
 
Okay we all know Muslims(Yes since to most people Terror=Islam) are deemed by the media to be the biggest threat to world peace, and that they are waging war on everyone in the world.

Okay well picture this Muslims from third world countries with no future feel threatened by everyone and feel they are the ones war is being waged on.

I'm British Muslim I see this from both sides and its pretty childish however thousands of people die because of this animal like 'lets wipe out the threat behavior'.

However there was a time when both the West and the East were at equilibrium in between the medieval dominance of Islam and the Modern Western dominance. It was the time of the Last Caliphate.

Now many people dont understand the Caliphate they see it as an Imperial tool of conquest however the Caliphate was abolished in 1924 at the end of the Empires game( If you dont include the American Empire   ).

The Caliphate is not a starting point for conquest its just at the time conquest was the norm, so you ask why the caliphate why now?

The Caliphate is an Installation of an Islamic superstate free from racial/linguistic divide and in many respects a welfare state An Islamic superstate would give the Muslim Community the ability to have a greater say in UN or even be part of the security council since I believe the Muslims Interests are grossly underrepresented in the UN, thus Terrorism being the only way many see as attracting attention. Muslims account for 1/5 of the world populous yet have almost negligible political influence.

I believe this Caliphate does not even have to be a Nation merely an alliance of Muslim countries and countries with Muslim majorities, to allow for a better representation of Muslims in the global stage.

Remember I explicitly say this not fact its opinion I'm not saying it might.

 

I'm pretty sure the Arab league represents most of the muslim nations of the world at the political stage. Perhaps expansion to a more generic muslim organisation is the way forward.
 
 
 
I've heard of your group, but they are considered non-muslims by the mainstream muslim world.

So your messiah has come? What now? What happens to the christians and muslims awaiting the return of christ?

 

Accept the Messiah and be part of the reformation of the world. The revolution is coming.

The Messiah has come and it's up to you all to accept him.
 
 
 
What do you mean how did Muhammad know?! He is a Prophet and Messenger of Allah. And no, hadeeths are not just rejected.

I mean how did he know that jesus christ is to be the islamic messiah? Just like how did he know the words of the quran when he was illiterate?

it might haev been like chinese whispers..

What is the textual evidence (I know there is no quranic evidence) by which muslims beleive that jesus christ is the muslims messiah?

how can it be apostasy when you claimed that the second coming of christ as the messiah is not an integral part of the islamic faith? Surely claiming that is it not an integral part of teh islamic faith is bad enough? No?
 
 
 
Well technically everything in Islam is integral, but you are elevating this topic to an unacceptable level, you are basically arguing that it's so important, that it must have been in the Qur'an.

And claiming that an ordinary human being is a Prophet of God like what the Qadianis/Ahmediyya did is instant apostasy and disbelief where even ignorance is not an excuse.

 

if rejecting this belief is apostasy, then surely it is an integral part of the faith!

If your allah talks about earthly things such as the atom or mountains and its scientifc occurances (according to muslims), then why the silence of a respected prophet as the islamic messiah (surely an integral part of the faith?)

don't muslims believe that prophets of god are ordinary human beings (i.e. not "supernatural")
 
 
 
Accept the Messiah and be part of the reformation of the world. The revolution is coming.

The Messiah has come and it's up to you all to accept him.

 

whats the 'revolution' about? What happens?

if one accepts your messiah, what then? what is the "prize" for accepting your messiah?
 
 
 
What you are advocating is blatant apostasy and disbelief. Whoever believes the Mirza guy is Christ is a disbeliever by unanimous agreement.

 

Tell me exactly how what I say is wrong?

If the Messiah was to come, why has he not come yet? What is Jesus waiting for? Is the world not in a bad enough state?Have the Muslims not lost their faith?

Have you not heard the Hadith: ‘When you find the Mahdi, perform bai’ah at his hands. You must go to him, even if you have to reach him across ice-bound mountains on your knees. He is the Mahdi and the Caliph of Allah.' (Ibn Maajah)

I do not find anyone else claiming to be the Imam Mahdi at this time. If we were wrong, then would God not have destroyed us? Yet we seem to be growing and have become a worldwide international community. Is this not enough proof of our truth, from humble beginnings in a tiny town in India, we have become a large worldwide community.

Just when I keep thinking that you are getting closer to understanding what I'm saying, it seems we could not misunderstand each other more. There are a lot of discrepancies in your posts regarding this religion of Islam and also many underlying assumptions that you have used. This argument is unique in the sense that it is more about me trying to make you understand our religion rather than refuting your argument. Your entire argument is that Muslims should not be believing that Jesus will return as the Messiah, this is incorrect by consensus of all the Muslims and all the text of Islam, so there's no argument there, do you understand where I'm getting at? This whole discussion is in a sense fruitless, because I'm simply trying to get you to understand the conclusion rather than pushing it.
 
 
 
whats the 'revolution' about? What happens?

if one accepts your messiah, what then? what is the "prize" for accepting your messiah?

 

The 'prize' is that you realize the truth. You find God and have communion with him. You become enlightened. You serve humanity. You contribute to good causes. Your mind and heart become clear and relieved in finding the truth.

Ultimately this community will triumph and dominate the world, dispelling darkness and bringing light to the world. Brining man once again back to its Creator - God.

This is bound to happen and we are working towards it at the moment. You can be a part of it if you recognize and accept the Reformer of the age.

Seriously, just read the content on the official sites I gave you with a open heart and mind and you will see the truth.

Have you not heard the Hadith: ‘When you find the Mahdi, perform bai’ah at his hands. You must go to him, even if you have to reach him across ice-bound mountains on your knees. He is the Mahdi and the Caliph of Allah.' (Ibn Maajah)

I do not find anyone else claiming to be the Imam Mahdi at this time. If we were wrong, then would God not have destroyed us? Yet we seem to be growing and have become a worldwide international community. Is this not enough proof of our truth, from humble beginnings in a tiny town in India, we have become a large worldwide community.

 

No. The Messiah will come. And believing that Mr. Ghulam Ahmed is the Messiah is kufr. It is also a completely baseless claim that leads to nothing except eternal punishment.

What is wrong with Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's claim to being the Messiah?

Why is it a baseless claim, what has he taught us which is against Islam?

He has just taught us the truth in all matters and has brought back our faith and taught nothing but good and the true Islam. What is wrong with that.

Listen to the words of The Holy Prophet (saw) and accept the Messiah. He has come, the signs are there are they not?
 
 
 
Just when I keep thinking that you are getting closer to understanding what I'm saying, it seems we could not misunderstand each other more. There are a lot of discrepancies in your posts regarding this religion of Islam and also many underlying assumptions that you have used. This argument is unique in the sense that it is more about me trying to make you understand our religion rather than refuting your argument. Your entire argument is that Muslims should not be believing that Jesus will return as the Messiah, this is incorrect by consensus of all the Muslims and all the text of Islam, so there's no argument there, do you understand where I'm getting at? This whole discussion is in a sense fruitless, because I'm simply trying to get you to understand the conclusion rather than pushing it.

 

In terms of religous discussions on other topics, muslims (tsr) present their belief and reason and bam, bam, bam, verse after verse, and the translations, interpretations etc... and its all about logic, rationality etc.... now when it comes to the biggest issue (to me at least, if not you), jesus christ, muslims are silent on this issue (as apparently there is not much going on in the quran about jesus as the islamic messiah). I'm trying to get my head around this! I'm sorry if this confuses you or is annoying you.

A point which I want to clarify is that you claim that jesus as the islamic messiah and his return is not an integral part of the islamic faith, yet you state that rejecting this part is apostasy. That doesn't make sense. Can you please clarify just this point, if anything.
 
 
 
I've heard of your group, but they are considered non-muslims by the mainstream muslim world.

 

Hey, by the way, nice to know you've heard of us. What else do you know about us. What are your thoughts? How did you find out about us?

Just interested to know your views.

See, this is proof that the mainstream Muslims are confused and in darkness. We've come to know the truth about Jesus and about everything through our acceptance of the Promised Messiah.
 
 
 
The 'prize' is that you realize the truth. You find God and have communion with him. You become enlightened. You serve humanity. You contribute to good causes. Your mind and heart become clear and relieved in finding the truth.

Ultimately this community will triumph and dominate the world, dispelling darkness and bringing light to the world. Brining man once again back to its Creator - God.

This is bound to happen and we are working towards it at the moment. You can be a part of it if you recognize and accept the Reformer of the age.

Seriously, just read the content on the official sites I gave you with a open heart and mind and you will see the truth.

 

I'll have a look when I have some time...

Well, this is both confusing and annoying. It would be much easier to convey the information face-to-face but through the internet, it's just too tedious, and useless for me as well. I don't gain anything and neither do you gain anything from this discussion. That we believe the Messiah will return is obligatory for all Muslims, so you can see why I don't particularly care about whether you agree with this or not. I'm more concerned that you don't believe in Islam than you disagreeing me with this issue about the Messiah returning. A discussion of why Islam is the true religion is the only discussion I am willing to write this much for on TSR frankly.

I hope you don't take this the wrong way.

through google and tsr discussions on religion and that you're not considered muslims by mainstream islam.

It's pretty interesting really, the whole claim that christ is lying at rest in india of all places! In know other people have stated that his grave lies somewhere in japan etc...
 
 
 
See, this is proof that the mainstream Muslims are confused and in darkness. We've come to know the truth about Jesus and about everything through our acceptance of the Promised Messiah.

I can understand why as a muslim teh whole issue of jesus christ as teh messiah is not an integral part of the faith to you (yet rejecting it is apostasy!   ), but for me, coming from a devout roman catholic family (im agnostic), the issue of christ is quite important and so to learn a few years ago that muslims believe him to te the messiah came as a shock... This is what interests me in islam and religous discussions and debates...

I've yet to come across a muslim who can confidently and clearly explain the muslims stance on christ as the islamic messiah with such passion and "textual evidence" as they do with smaller issues...

I posed the same question on tsr ask a muslim thread but there was also a general silence there and the idea of "blind faith" came across..

anyway thanks for your contribution...

No problem. I might try an clarify a bit more some other time.

what happens to the muslims who don't accept your messiah? Do they still get their caliphate and "world dominance" ?
 
 
 
Ehh, better than sanctioning the murder of hundreds of Jews as a mid-life crisis  

 

You're an Atheist for God sakes. You don't even deserve a proper response to that.

It would have been good if you could clarify now... if you can't then just explain the point about jesus as teh messiah not being an integral part of islam point (It will keep buggin me all day)....

you claim that it is not an integral part of the islamic faith, yet you say to reject it is apostasy? Does this really make sense?
 
 
 
Did you know that your supposed 'Messiah' died defecating?

 

OK, firstly, that is a vicious rumour and lie spread people who oppose us.

Secondly, why are you so opposed to us? Nothing we practice is against Islam. We offer our 5 daily prayers, read and believe in the Qur'an and Hadith. We say the Kalima. We perform and obey all the basic Islamic obligations.

Why is it so hard to believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is The Promised Messiah?

Have you seen the work we do? We send doctors, teachers, engineers to Africa to build and run schools and hospitals, to find water and set up water pumps.

We produce literature, defending and promoting Islam, love, peace and brotherhood.

It seems as though some mullah may have brainwashed you, tell me what you have against us?

I think his meaning is that to reject it is wrong. But that it's not the most important part of the faith. Meaning that there are other more important things than just believing in the second coming. Such as practising the faith properly first of all.

You don't agree with him, that's the problem. He's the kind of Muslim that gives all of you a bad reputation. The rabid, hateful, ignorant Muslim so self assured that he cannot even begin to consider another person's point of view as correct.

Well, like I said before, for a person to say that the issue of the return of Jesus Christ must definitely be in the Qur'an because it is apparently such a central theme to the religion is false and incorrect. This is what I meant.

I'll give you an example. And please understand this example before commenting.

A person doesn't know that Jesus Christ will return as the Messiah but they are Muslim. The reason they don't know is because it doesn't say so in the Qur'an, and they don't bother checking out the hadeeth. If somebody or scholars were to some to him later with all the hadeeth about Jesus Christ returning and they say "No, I reject this completely", then this is a clear case of apostasy because they have knowingly rejected something that has been narrated by the Prophet and is agreed upon. But you can see how it wasn't integral to his life before this information came to him, because it is perfectly possible for a Muslim to do all the physical components of Islam and much more without necessarily knowing that Jesus Christ will return in the first place. But once the evidence that he will return is presented to him, it is not possible for him to reject it.

Now do you understand?

So in Islam ignorance excuses does it?

Well yes, why should one be punished for something he does not know?

If you commit a sin without knowing, then in Islam, God usually does not punish him as he did not consciously make the decision to commit the sin.

So if say, a Muslim did not know properly the rules about Jihad and how to engage in conflict and became a suicide bomber, that is ok because he didn't know the rules? Ignorance is never an excuse.

There's ignorance, then there's common sense. Suicide bombers have been brainwashed but if they used their common sense then they'd know that suicide bombing is wrong.

The blame doesn't rest solely on the bombers but also a lot of the blame rests on the extremist scholars who brainwash young minds in to thinking that suicide bombing will lead to paradise. This is of course not true and against Islam.

So part of the blame lies on the suicide bomber and a lot lies on the extremist scholar who brainwashes hundreds of young minds, giving them wrong messages.

It does. It was sort of an insult/joke. You said in Islam being ignorant of something excuses you, and I said 'guess that explains why some Muslims are so ignorant', or something along those lines. Thereby implying they knew full well of this ignorance clause and make full use of it. See it's a play on the fact I find many Muslims highly ignorant in many aspects of knowledge and the fact that you just admitted that ignorance is a-ok according to Islam. Get it now?

That was just an extreme example. What I'm saying is ignorance is a valid excuse in Islam, which I see as rather wrong. After all, I thought Islam taught you to strive for knowldge and understanding? How can you do this if you are ignorant of your own religion? Certainly there should be no excuse for the ignorance of a Muslim regarding Islam.
 
 
 
Guess that explains why so many Muslims are so ignorant then  

 

It seems from some of your posts that you are staunchly against Islam.

At least have a discussion with a fair, open and unbiased mind. You do know that all Muslims aren't terrorists or extremists don't you?

There are some very nice, good, friendly Muslims out there.

You do also know that the basic teachings of Islam are very similar to the teachings of Christianity and Judaism don't you?

The teachings of peace, love, forgiveness, brotherhood, charity etc. Just because people don't follow their religion properly doesn't mean that the religion itself is wrong.

It's impossible for somebody to seek ignorance, if they knowingly turn away from something that might deal with their ignorance, then they are no longer classified as ignorant in Islam. The Qur'an explains clearly the consequences of those who turn away from the Qur'an and the teachings of Islam knowingly. This type of disbelief is called tawalaa.
 
 
 
so what is the evidence (if not quranic)

 

Many hadeeths. I'm just too tired to try and quote them or find them, but basically the evidence is substantial enough that there is unanimous agreement on this issue from the time of the Prophet himself to this day.

Exactly, Islam tells us to acquire knowledge as best we can. But it is impossible to know everything about anything. There will always be gaps in our knowledge because there is too much knowledge and information out there.

Islam says learn as much as you can about religion so that you can do the right things. But if you happen to not know something, then how can God punish you if you didn't know?

Most knowledge is basic anyway and everyone knows the basic teachings so they cannot have an excuse, also common sense covers the rest.

It would be extremely unfair and cruel to punish someone who did not know the rules or teachings.

I am against ISlam, and yes I know all of these things. This appeal to have an unbiased debate is entirely hypocritical because clearly you have a huge bias. I think what you mean is reasonable debate, which is what we are having, a throw away comment directed at some one other than you does nothing to detract from that.

I rather think a MUslim should know pretty much everything about ISlam though. I'm not expecting scholarly levels, but you should be able to give a basic opinion and Islamic perspective on anything. I suppose that's just my opinion, but on such fundamentals as who your prophets are and what you're supposed to believe about them, well I'd imagine that inofrmation is rather readily accessible.
 
 
 
so what is the evidence (if not quranic)

 

I believe there is some evidence in the Qur'an but I guess it's open to interpretation:

And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour), but follow ye Me: this is a Straight Way.
(Quran, Az-Zukhuruf, 43:61)

Here is the evidence in the Hadith:

"By the One who owns my soul, it is nigh, of a certainty, that the son of Mary will appear among you. He will be a judge, he will be just; so he will break the cross (refute Christian doctrines with reason and arguments--Commentary on Bukhari by Ainee) and kill the swine (a figurative speech denoting greedy, dirty and annoying person-- an abomination. Killing also is through spiritual means); and he will stop war." (Bukhari, Vol. 1)

"What will be your condition when the son of Mary will descend among you and he will be your Imam from among yourselves." (Bukhari, Kitabul Anbiya, Bab Nazool Isa)

"The Ummah can never die which has me at one end and the Messiah, son of Mary, at the other." (Ibn Maja, Bab Al-I'atisam Bis-Sunnah)

There are quite a few more narrations as well in the Hadith. Whenever Messiah, son of Mary is referred to, it's just metaphorical to indicate the second coming of Jesus. Not the physical return of Jesus as he has passed away and cannot return because he was a human, Messenger of God.

I suppose that's just my opinion, but on such fundamentals as who your prophets are and what you're supposed to believe about them, well I'd imagine that inofrmation is rather readily accessible.

 

I'd agree. All Muslims should know the basics of their religion and if they did and followed it correctly then we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world these days.

The basic knowledge is there and very accessible.
 
 
 
I am against ISlam, and yes I know all of these things.

 

Why then, if I may ask are you against Islam? If you are against Islam then you must be against other religions as well?

I don't really want to start a deep, long discussion/debate as it's very late now so please just a basic quick answer as I'm interested to know why you don't like Islam.
 
 
 
This is America: "See that land, see that oil? Let's go bomb them."
Caliphate or no Caliphate. If you've got oil and resources, you better watch out or else America will bomb you.

 

Actually, the US has gotten involved in middle-eastern wars for altruistic reasons. It was cleaning up the mess left by imperial powers. In fact, we got less oil out of Iraq because of the war..

 

 
True thus you agree America is the reason for Islamic terrorism?

 

And yet muslims are the ones who kill innocent americans by the thousands?

You both need to stop talking nonsense.

Only way to stop Islamic terrorism is to realise that many of the people in the west who equate Islam with terrorism have exactly the same agenda as the extremists themselves. That is, to partition, polarise, spread fear or prejudice. Usually it's just through ignorance, but sometimes there are more sinister motives.

9/11 killed people from many backgrounds and cultures. So did the 7/7 bombings. There was no coincidence - that was exactly what they were designed to do. The most multicultural spots of the most multicultural cities of the world, and that's where the extremists struck. The kind of tolerance that is shown to each other every day by New Yorkers or Londoners, where you might share a Tube carriage with individuals from 150 different countries, is anathema to extremists; it jeopardises their self-proclaimed sense of authority, dividing the world into Muslim = good, non-Muslim = bad, or indeed the other way round, depending on their perspective.

Political Islam has acted as a unifying force for what was in effect a loose collection of localized grievances from Morocco to Malaysia. In that regard it has been very successful; it has not required any particular structure or co-ordination, other than the spread of an ideology. If your society is oppressed, whether by a local dictator or by a perceived imperial hegemony, the potential for terrorism exists. In an Islamic society with those conditions, the potential for a supranational Islamism which spans borders exists.

However, given that the vast majority of Muslims worldwide have not responded to bin Laden's to rise up in global jihad, there really is no excuse for confusing extremists and the main body. Popular support has dwindled for Islamic extremism everywhere it had made significant advances: in Algeria (early 90s), Egypt (mid-90s), Afghanistan (early-2000s), Iraq (mid-2000s) - in all cases the extremists lost support, became marginalised and eventually lost power due to public revulsion.

So that's what you do: treat claims conflating Islam with Terrorism with the ridicule they deserve, marginalise the extremists, engage with the moderates, continue to get the Tube and treat everyone with the same courtesy.

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL, your so misinformed. Americans have killed more than 1000 times more people during there campaigns to spread democracy they are definitely worse then evil the biggest Islamic terrorists.

Remember Vietnam?
Remember Iraq?
Remember Nagasaki/Hiroshima?
Remember the various African/South American conflicts funded by America Blood money?

America ARE the biggest terrorists in the world just because they serve British interests does not make them any better than Al-qaeeda.

Popular support has dwindled for Islamic extremism everywhere it had made significant advances: in Algeria (early 90s), Egypt (mid-90s), Afghanistan (early-2000s), Iraq (mid-2000s) - in all cases the extremists lost support, became marginalised and eventually lost power due to public revulsion.

So that's what you do: treat claims conflating Islam with Terrorism with the ridicule they deserve, marginalise the extremists, engage with the moderates, continue to get the Tube and treat everyone with the same courtesy.

 

I don't agree how the extremists act but nevertheless, this ''unifying force'' is similar to how Israel was created and dare I say it, US, as a sort of homeland.
 
 
 
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL, your so misinformed. Americans have killed more than 1000 times more people during there campaigns to spread democracy they are definitely worse then evil the biggest Islamic terrorists.

Remember Vietnam?
Remember Iraq?
Remember Nagasaki/Hiroshima?
Remember the various African/South American conflicts funded by America Blood money?

America ARE the biggest terrorists in the world just because they serve British interests does not make them any better than Al-qaeeda.

 

I disagree.

I find that I, and most people, would rather go with Britain that Al-qaeeda.

If they were the ones in power and British terrorists made an attack on them would they just let it go? No.

Would they be as careful where they tred in the war as Britain and America? No.

Does America, Britain or anywhere else oppress people like Al-qaeeda.
 
 
 
Hmmm, but surely you're in favour of the invasion of Iraq (Saddam was a horrible man who killed Muslims) and that of Afghanistan (Al Qaeda was very oppressive)? The issue being the puppet governments installed by the West.

 

Of course, he must be in favour, no one would want an oppressor such as Saddam killing innocent Kurds and Shia's.

But who got him to that position of power... The west. They even supported him solely during the Iran/Iraq war, which was waged by Iraq, to gain dominence over the newly created Islamic State of Iran. How can Muslims not think they are being waged war against, since every modern western state supported Iraq.

Even in Afganistan, the US was involved in putting Al Qaeda into power, intended for use when the Soviets were in Afganistan. But I doubt anyone would know the extent of the consequences that funding Al qaeda during the cold war would bring.

In a way, the west is responsible for terrorism.
 
 
 
I believe there is some evidence in the Qur'an but I guess it's open to interpretation:

And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour), but follow ye Me: this is a Straight Way.
(Quran, Az-Zukhuruf, 43:61)

Here is the evidence in the Hadith:

"By the One who owns my soul, it is nigh, of a certainty, that the son of Mary will appear among you. He will be a judge, he will be just; so he will break the cross (refute Christian doctrines with reason and arguments--Commentary on Bukhari by Ainee) and kill the swine (a figurative speech denoting greedy, dirty and annoying person-- an abomination. Killing also is through spiritual means); and he will stop war." (Bukhari, Vol. 1)

"What will be your condition when the son of Mary will descend among you and he will be your Imam from among yourselves." (Bukhari, Kitabul Anbiya, Bab Nazool Isa)

"The Ummah can never die which has me at one end and the Messiah, son of Mary, at the other." (Ibn Maja, Bab Al-I'atisam Bis-Sunnah)

There are quite a few more narrations as well in the Hadith. Whenever Messiah, son of Mary is referred to, it's just metaphorical to indicate the second coming of Jesus. Not the physical return of Jesus as he has passed away and cannot return because he was a human, Messenger of God.

 

Salaams. Brother where is your evidence/proof that Jesus(pbuh) has passed away?

Why then, if I may ask are you against Islam? If you are against Islam then you must be against other religions as well?

I don't really want to start a deep, long discussion/debate as it's very late now so please just a basic quick answer as I'm interested to know why you don't like Islam.

 

Yes, I am against all religions, but particularly Islam for a variety of reasons. It's lack of willing to modernise and compromise, the lack of seperation of church and state, the moral values of the religion, the derision of logical and scientific thought inherent within organised religion and so forth. Please, don't make the mistkae many Muslims do and call me ignorant, or tell me I just don;t understand, you seem to be more reasonable than that.

That would be the Taliban/Mujahadeen, not AQ, btw.

And what would you have the West do? Never get involved at all? Well we have tried that, we end up with the likes of Rwanda. And like it or not, in an area rich in natural reasources, we have to get involved. We overthrow dictators and we are the Imperialist West, we secure our own interets and trade with the winners? We are propping up dictators. Nothing the West can do is ever right for people like you. Just suck it up. Guess what, nations aren't altruistic, that isn't unique to the West, every nation on Earth secures it's own interests. Just be grateful we have enough alktruism in us to dispose of dictators that are genocidal rather than forever moaning about how evil the West is.
 
 
 
Salaams. Brother where is your evidence/proof that Jesus(pbuh) has passed away?

 

Wassalam.

It is clearly evident from the Qur'an that Jesus (pbuh) has passed away as all Allah’s Messengers have, ‘

The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger’ (Holy Qur’an 5:76).

‘And Muhammad is only a Messenger. Verily, all Messengers have passed away before him.’ (3:145).

In these verses, Allah has clearly told us that all messengers have passed away including Jesus (pbuh)

Once you die you cannot come back, this is the law of Allah, and He does not send back to this world anyone once they have died. Allah says in the Holy Qur’an,

“Until, when death comes to one of them, he says entreating, ‘My Lord, send me back, That I may do righteous deeds in the life that I have left behind.’ Never, it is but a word that he utters. And behind them is a barrier until the day when they shall be raised again.” (23:100-101)

This proves that once a man has died even if he begged and wished to come back to mend his ways, he would not be able to. ‘Behind them is a barrier’ means there is no way back to this earth, once you have died, there is no way to come back, you will only be ‘raised again’ in a new life.

Thus the Qur'an conclusively proves that Jesus (peace be upon him) has passed away.

What translation of the Qur'an are you using?
Spoiler:

Qur'an 3:144

Muhsin Khan
Muhammad (SAW) is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah, and Allah will give reward to those who are grateful.

Pickthall
Muhammad is but a messenger, messengers (the like of whom) have passed away before him. Will it be that, when he dieth or is slain, ye will turn back on your heels? He who turneth back on his heels doth no hurt to Allah, and Allah will reward the thankful.

Yusuf Ali
Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many Were the messenger that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will ye then Turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; but Allah (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude.

It does not mention that all messengers have passed away...
Heres an actual ayah confirming what happened to Isa(pbuh).

Qur'an 4:158-159

"And because of their saying (in boast), "We killed Messiah 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allah," - but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of 'Iesa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) ] "

"But Allah raised him ['Iesa (Jesus)] up unto Himself. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise."

There are many ahadeeth that confirm the return of Jesus(pbuh) as the son of mary and not the son of any other woman.

Why Allah says 'raised him', it means raised in status.

The emphasise in the verse is that they did not kill Jesus. Therefore he was still alive when taken down from a cross. Besides, how can a Messenger of Allah die (God Forbid) a cursed death which crucifixion was.

The hadith about second coming of Jesus refers to a person in the form of Jesus, like Jesus and with the same mission, to revive the faith of the people and unite them.

If Allah had to send anyone back to earth to revive the Muslim Ummah, would not Muhammad (saw) be the best and appropriate choice, the best teacher and best man and Prophet to walk the face of the earth?

Why would a Jewish Prophet come back for Muslims? Also how can Jesus, a Prophet come when The Holy Prophet (saw) was Khatamun Nabiyeen, the seal of all the Prophets?

You're playing a dangerous game here. Can you not see the idiocy of your view? The qur'anic ayah specifically states that Allah raised him unto himself. As you very well know, no mortal can have the same status or rank as Allah(SWT). This lays a huge gaping hole in your philosophy of being raised in status. It goes against the principles of Tawheed and can almost amount to polytheism, a deed that is unforgivable if dead upon. And the ahadeeth clearly state that it is the return of the Son of Mary and no one else, no imposter.

Allah(SWT) has infinite wisdom and is all-knowing. His decisions and the decree are something that we mere mortals will never ever begin to grasp. We are none to question Allah's will. Yes Muhammad(sallalahu alayhi wasalaam) is the last and final messenger. His message is the final message and will be until the day of Judgement. Jesus(pbuh) will return and will abide by this message i.e. the Qur'an. So it does not break the seal of the Prophets. What would break the seal of the prophets, would be a new prophet, with a new message.

Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘‘Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend, and their leader the Mahdi will say, "Come and lead us in prayer," but he will say, "No, one of them should lead them as an honour to this ummah from Allaah."’" The version narrated by Muslim says: "… Then ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend and their leader will say, ‘Come and lead us in prayer,’ but he will say, ‘No, some of you are leaders over others as an honour from Allaah to this ummah.’" (Reported by Muslim, 225)

This Hadith put things into context nicely. I hope you understand that your beliefs resemble those of that the Prophet(sallalahu alayhi wasalaam) warned us about. I.e. false messiahs, liars, dajjals etc... Take heed of the Prophet(sallalahu alayhi wasalaam) warning. We live in turbulent times, let not your own emotions cloud your judgement.

Salaams.

Here is a Sahih hadith which evidently points to the return of the genuine messiah Jesus(pbuh).

Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it...

Sahih Muslim Book 41 Hadith 7015

Btw who do you believe to be the new Jesus?
 
 
 
How so?? Explain?
I read somwhere that American construction firm Halliburton will have all the contracts to rebuild Iraq.

 

The war in Afghanistan alone has cost over 1.4 trillion dollars to America alone, it does not make any sense, the figures do not add up. America has not profited from the war. Some companies may have yes, but America has not, it has expended a truelly monumental amount of resources.

JazakAllah for your advice brother. I could say the same to you though.

The Holy Prophet (saw) instructed:

‘When you find the Mahdi, perform bai’ah at his hands. You must go to him, even if you have to reach him across ice-bound mountains on your knees. He is the Mahdi and the Caliph of Allah. (Ibn Maajah).

Now as there is only one claimant of being The Promised Messiah who is worthy of notice and has formed a significant community, should you not go and do bai'ah at his hand?

No where does it say that Jesus was physically lifted in to heaven. 'Raised him unto himself' is just a figure of speech to signify that Allah brought Jesus (as) closer to himself. It's also a common prayer, 'raise me' meaning raise my status, reputation and righteousness.

Has any man come down from the heavens to this day?

By giving the example of 'Jesus son of Mary' the Qur'an and Hadith are just drawing our attention to the fact that just like a Messiah (Jesus) came for the revival of the Jews, a similar Messiah, 'like unto Jesus' will come for the Muslims who will be a follower of The Holy Prophet (saw) and from his Ummah. 'From among themselves'.

He will have the same mission as Jesus and will resemble him.

Please try and understand Brother, Muslims have been misguided and fallen into error, making the same mistakes as the Christians and interpreting verses literally rather than metaphorically.

Hmmm, but surely you're in favour of the invasion of Iraq (Saddam was a horrible man who killed Muslims) and that of Afghanistan (Al Qaeda was very oppressive)? The issue being the puppet governments installed by the West.

 

Well, some may say that under Saddam, Women in Iraq were at the forefront of rights and politics and when the Americans and the Coalition came in, they actually reversed that trend. Now Iraq is a more conservative place. One may also argue that Saddam used to keep these fundamental clerics in check, although he did use questionable means. Now that Saddam has gone, Women rights have actually diminished (forget democracy for the moment) and Iraq has become torn through civil war which started mainly because of the clerics stirring things up.

Now in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda may have been oppressive but they managed to do, along with the Taliban, what no other nation or group including the British has ever done. They united these tribal people's and bought them under control so that they would stop killing each other over a few lost goats or chickens. Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, again with the Taliban, also can be credited with the ending of the Cold war and the implosion of the USSR.

So if you go to look at it, there is some positivity which can be gleaned from the invasions and occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan respectively, but essentially the wars have made people go back to fighting their old enemies. The sunnis vs the shias and the Taliban fighting the Northern Alliance.

Now we come to the problem. The West, especially the Americans think that they can impose their policies upon the Muslims but Muslims take a long time to change. Look at the Israeli conflict. They were angry for 60 odd years but now take a more conciliatory tone towards the occupation of their land. The issue of democracy is fathomable in theory in the Middle East but it's not practical because most citizens are divided by tribes and then sub divided into further tribes. Add feuds to that mentality and you have a very volatile situation which finally blew up when the Americans invaded.

Once again though, not really the COalitions fault is it? I mean, is it their fault that in a time of turmoil the worst in certain Islamic sects have come out to play? Yes, perhaps they facilitated the situation, but the blame rests ultimatley on your brother Muslim's shoulders, not ours. If I leave you in an empty shop, sure you can steal. Was it sensible of me to leave you there? No, but did I make you steal? No. Just a simple analogy. You see it really bugs me when people blame the West for the actions of the Natives.

And in Afghanistan, yes they kept the tribal people in peace. But ask yourself how? Brutal treatment of those who disagreed, theocratic justice taken to the extreme along with allowing the tribes to get away with crimes against humanity so long as they showed the Taliban the right respect. The Taliban also had such lovely policies as killing people who taught girls how to read, and public lashings for men without proper beards. Hell, Stalin had his good points, Hitler, Mao and Guevera, they all had upsides, that doesn't make them in any way good.

Was it sensible of me to leave you there? No, but did I make you steal? No. Just a simple analogy. You see it really bugs me when people blame the West for the actions of the Natives.

 

Well, the deposing of Saddam Hussein under the pretext of WMD's (which were never found) led to the state which Iraq is in now. Simply put, if Iraq had not been invaded (Many don't even know why they invaded in the first place), then the scale of violence which is persisting today would not have come about.

I disagree with your analogy. Let's take a fresher approach to see where the blame lies.

Iraqi Citizens = Mice
Saddam Hussein = Cat
Coalition/US = Dog.

Now, just say that your house is infested with mice intent on causing trouble. You own a cat which makes a pretty effective tool for getting rid of the mice. Now, the next door neighbour's dog feels envious that whilst he's getting fruit as food, you are living in luxury with meat/fish every single day. The dog vows to get rid of you so that he can be fed the good meals and this comes to pass. Now, the dog has slunk back to its house and the mice have increased twenty-fold because they breed like rabbits and there is no Cat there to stop them. Sure, you bring cats, but instead of chasing down the mice, they just play with them and give their meaty food to the Dog. Eventually, it has just become unbearable because these mice are just running around creating destruction.

As the owner of the house, who is responsible for the destruction of the house?

1) The mice, who were not kept in check by the Cat.
2) The Cat, who was destroyed by the greedy Dog eager for more food.
3) The Dog, who demanded everyone obey him.

 
And in Afghanistan, yes they kept the tribal people in peace. But ask yourself how? Brutal treatment of those who disagreed, theocratic justice taken to the extreme along with allowing the tribes to get away with crimes against humanity so long as they showed the Taliban the right respect. The Taliban also had such lovely policies as killing people who taught girls how to read, and public lashings for men without proper beards. Hell, Stalin had his good points, Hitler, Mao and Guevera, they all had upsides, that doesn't make them in any way good.
 

Well, since we are debating about "brutal treatment", why don't we invade China where the people don't have a voice and are suppressed if they come out to make themselves heard?

Don't get me wrong. I'm all for rights and all that but why is there double standards when it comes to brutal Muslim regimes. If a Muslim country does not follow what their puppet masters tell them, they get deposed or assassinated. Just take a look at the last 50 odd years in Latin America where numerous people, WHO WANTED THEIR RESOURCES FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE, got assassinated by the very people who preach that "democracy is best". But I digress.

By the way, just how can people evaluate whether a person is "good or bad"?
 
 
 
I think you know, and your Hadith above just proves his claim.
Not 'new' Jesus, second coming of Jesus (as)

 http://www.alislam.org/topics/messiah/index.php 

Have a read please.

 

I have read quite a bit about the Ahmadiyya movement and have come to the same conclusion. This so called messiah of yours has passed away and yet the coming of the Dajjal has not passed. This in itself is enough proof to vindicate your beliefs as incorrect. Do study this hadith in detail as it pertains to the true Messiah...

Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him...

Sahih Muslim book 41 Hadith 7015
 
 
 
Nope Since it Killed more PEOPLE(Muslims and Non-muslims are people). Yes British Imperialism was the root cause of almost all world problems today its true but no one admits it.

 

Greatest thing to ever happen to this planet chief.

But I digress.

By the way, just how can people evaluate whether a person is &quot;good or bad&quot;?

 

Except that cat now urinates every where, bits it's owner and kills the mice indiscriminatly, it doesn't just keep them in check. Infact, that cat opresses the mice, commits acts of racially motivated segregation and genocide, and well, the metaphor is getting lost. Essentially it boils down to this. Yes, an opressive genocidal dictator kept the opressive, brutal theocrats in check, but does that mean we should leave the brutal, genocidal dictator in power? Just because he keeps other brutal, insane individuals in check? Well, some would answer yes, better the devil you know and all that. And oh wait, you have a go at the West for doing that aswell. We keep relative order by trading with and supporting a leader, and we're the corrupt West propping up a dictator for our own gain. We depose the same dictator, and we're the Imperialist West deposing sovereign leaders for opposing us, ultimatley for our own gain. We can never win, that's the problem. People like you will blame us for every problem instead of looking at the route cause. Yes, we made a misjudgement on Saddam in the 90's, we have tried to rectify that, give us some credit. It is not our fault retarded Islamic militias are intent on destroying their own country and people.

And well, because war with China would be the end of all of us. Do you understand the logistics of keeping up a military campaign? The role China plays in all Western economies? We are limited by what we can do. If we could just have China behaving like the UK tomorrow by declaring war on them, and there be no negative consequences then you best believe it would have happened. But in actuality the whole world would descend into madness.

And yes, shock horror, sometimes governments act in their own interests as opposed to universal altruism. This isn't a trait unique to Western countries. And just a caveat, for every 'assassination' you know of, I'm sure you don;t know half of the facts.This is no insult, I'm just saying any such 'assassination' by secret services will, by definition almost, be a rather secret affair, and no amount of anti-Western blogs will have all of the facts, despite what they claim.

Sahih Muslim book 41 Hadith 7015

 

Thank You for reading what I sent you.

It seems you are taking a literal meaning from this Hadith. Consider - 'Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see.'

This is metaphorical, smelling a person's odour cannot kill you. Also how can someone breath reach as far as one can see? Breath means his teachings and his words, this means his teachings and words would spread and reach all over the earth.

You know that The Qur'an and Hadith speak in metaphors, so this Hadith is also full of metaphors.

Also when The Messiah comes he won't go and kill Dajjal immediately, it is illogical, Messengers of God don't just hunt and kill. They preach and bring people to the truth. Dajjal will be defeated over time, by words and arguments. By the pen not the sword as the Messiah was to come to end all wars. Dajjal will be defeated by the community of The Promised Messiah God-willing.

Also what is your understanding of Dajjal? Dajjal is not one person or one group of people. It is the false ideas and ideologies of people that corrupt their faith. The evil things that people indulge in today and the things that lead them astray.

By saying 'He will kill Dajjal' means the Messiah will clear up all misunderstandings, refute false allegations against Islam and defend Islam. He will lead people away from Dajjali influences and show them the truth thus eventually killing Dajjal once and for all when people have accepted him and removed these evil thinking and actions from the world. Only through accepting the messiah this can and will happen.

I would suggest reading a little more Ahmadiyya literature. Also just ponder a little about the state of Muslims and if Jesus or another Messiah was to come, what is he waiting for? The Muslims are crying out for a saviour. If he has not come yet, then why not? Also can Allah really send another Prophet back to this earth in the place of the beloved and greatest Prophet (saw) If anyone was to be sent back to this earth then surely it would be The Holy Prophet (saw) the greatest man and Prophet ever to have walked the face of the earth. Why would and how could a Jewish Messiah (PBUH) come to save the Muslims?

I am telling you Jesus has come, the Messiah has come and his Jamaat (community) is working day in and day out for the betterment of the world, for the reformation of the Muslims and the world. They have Missions in almost all countries of the world bringing people to Islam, the true Islam. The work was started by our Messiah, the seed was planted, now his community is carrying on his work and he predicted that within 300 years we shall see the victory of Islam and Ahmadiyya and it will dominate the world.

There is unity and leadership in this Jamaat, there are many good schemes and many books and articles written by this community for the defence and propagation of Islam. No other Muslim organisation does more for Islam than this community. Qur'an is translated in to many different languages.

Placing his hand on Hadhrat Salman (ra) who was a Persian, The Holy Prophet is reported to have said, ‘If Faith were to go up to the Pleiades, a man, from among these would surely bring it back’ (Bukhari)

The Promised Messiah who we believe is of Persian origin, and have a look at Qadian, India and the white minaret, is it not east of Damascus? Look on Google maps.  http://www.alislam.org/library/minara.html 

Does anyone else claim to have fulfilled this prophecy?
Is this not the fulfilment of the prophecy in the Hadith which you yourself quoted?

Clear signs are there for you, but pray that Allah guides you to the right path and if this is it, then may he guide you to it, InshaAllah (God-Willing).

Now it is up to you to obey the Holy Prophet (saw) :

[SIZE="3"] ‘When you find the Mahdi, perform bai’ah at his hands. You must go to him, even if you have to reach him across ice-bound mountains on your knees. He is the Mahdi and the Caliph of Allah. (Ibn Maajah).
 
 
 
Greatest thing to ever happen to this planet chief.

 

It brought a few benefits to this world, but none of them were altruistic and overall the british empire was disastrous for the countries occupied.

"Slay them wherever you find them...Idolatry is worse than carnage...Fight against them until idolatry is no more and God's religion reigns supreme." (Surah 2:190-)
"Men are tempted [in this life] by the lure of women...far better is the return of God. Say: 'Shall I tell you of better things than these, with which the righteous shall be rewarded by their Lord? Theirs shall be gardens watered by running streams, where they shall dwell for ever: wives of perfect chastity..." (Surah 3:14, 15)
"Forbidden to you are...married women, except those you own as slaves." (Surah 4:20-, 24-)
"Believers, take neither Jews nor Christians for your friends." (Surah 5:51)
"Fight against such as those to whom the Scriptures were given [Jews and Christians]...until they pay tribute out of hand and are utterly subdued." (Surah 9:27-)
"Believers, when you encounter the infidels on the march, do not turn your backs to them in flight. If anyone on that day turns his back to them, except it be for tactical reasons...he shall incur the wrath of God and Hell shall be his home..." (Surah 8:12-)

Yeah, really good things the koran is teaching here...
 
 
 
...

 

Comparing the political power of countries in the UN and America to that of muslims ?
Nice. It's great that you have your beliefs, but don't kid yourself into thinking you have a right as a religious group to influence the rest of the world in a comparable way to that of nations.

Mate, you do not even know what we are talking about. I didn't even quote the Qur'an in my post. At least read what I wrote. You're being foolish. What you have posted has no relevance to my post whatsoever. I don't know what is up with you people, AT LEAST read what my post is about.

It's not even directed at you. I was trying to explain something to my Muslim brother and it is of no concern to you!

If you have managed to read this far, then well done, read on...

You have quoted from the Qur'an some verses which are used to criticise us.

A lot of the verses were specific to that time when some Muslims befriended Jews who were intent on harming Muslims. About the lure of women, Qur'an is teaching against adultery. Notice there is no specific punishment for adultery, only a reward is mentioned for those who control their feelings towards women.

Similarly there are genuine explanation for all the verses.

As I had no intention of debating you originally, I will put off answering your post in full for now as I am posting responses to other people and also it is late and I have to get up early tomorrow.

Hopefully someone else will answer your allegations in full as I could not at this time, otherwise I'll attempt to later on when I have some free time...

You don't understand the Koran, clearly. The passages are clearly exclusive of other religions and other people.
 
 
 
"Believers, take neither Jews nor Christians for your friends." (Surah 5:51)

 

Oh come on, everyone knows that in context, that verse means that Muslims should not take Jews or Christians as their protectorates or close allies in times of war. Nothing to do with general friendship.
 
 
 
Oh come on, everyone knows that in context, that verse means that Muslims should not take Jews or Christians as their protectorates or close allies in times of war. Nothing to do with general friendship.

 

So it's ok for me to say something along the lines of

'Slay the Muslim wherever you may find him, for he has shown himself to be tricksy', akin to Surahs quoted. That would be ok if I was fighting against some Muslims would it? Say, if I was a soldier in Afghanistan, would that be ok to write in a book? A book which I then claim to be infallable and read to my children. No, no it would not be. And well, if God and his Messenger couldn;t see that putting that in the Quran was a little ill judged, well then I honestly doubt the intelligence of both of them.

Context is one thing yes, but when we're talking about the perfect book, from the perfect man, from the perfect God, you have to question why there are verses like this within it. Unless of course, shock horror here, it was just a book written by men.  
 
 
 
It brought a few benefits to this world, but none of them were altruistic and overall the british empire was disastrous for the countries occupied.

 

Because Empires and Nations are generally known for their altruism

Well, I've researched them all, and some do have some 'context', and I use the term loosely. But my point stands, in a perfect, timeless book, written by the perfect messegner of a perfect God, why do we have verses such as these? If I were to write similar verses today in a book I'd be labaled a horrible racist, a short sighted bigot, and yet here it's ok because of the 'context'? Well the problem with this is of course, that Islam claims that the Quran is perfect and timeless, so how can you have any argument of context? Either it's perfect and timeless or it is not, and if it is not then it is full of bile and bigotry.
 
 
 
Greatest thing to ever happen to this planet chief.

 

GTFO
 
 
 
Except that cat now urinates every where, bits it's owner and kills the mice indiscriminatly, it doesn't just keep them in check. Infact, that cat opresses the mice, commits acts of racially motivated segregation and genocide, and well, the metaphor is getting lost. Essentially it boils down to this. Yes, an opressive genocidal dictator kept the opressive, brutal theocrats in check, but does that mean we should leave the brutal, genocidal dictator in power? Just because he keeps other brutal, insane individuals in check? Well, some would answer yes, better the devil you know and all that. And oh wait, you have a go at the West for doing that aswell. We keep relative order by trading with and supporting a leader, and we're the corrupt West propping up a dictator for our own gain. We depose the same dictator, and we're the Imperialist West deposing sovereign leaders for opposing us, ultimatley for our own gain. We can never win, that's the problem. People like you will blame us for every problem instead of looking at the route cause. Yes, we made a misjudgement on Saddam in the 90's, we have tried to rectify that, give us some credit. It is not our fault retarded Islamic militias are intent on destroying their own country and people.

 

If the cost of having a few "oppressive, brutal theocratic" - who by your understanding, are intent on killing the unbelievers and bringing America to it's knees through acts of terrorism, isn't it better for them to be put away rather than create a power vacuum which they have exploited and can now be disastrous not only for their own citizens, but for other countries?

The problem here is not the citizens of the West per se, but the foreign policy of the Western nations as derived by the often powerful and wealthy politicians who seek to further their own aims and ambitions of others, mainly corporate businesses.

Just answer this one question: Why does the West,specifically the Governments, like interfering in the politics of another country?

 
And well, because war with China would be the end of all of us. Do you understand the logistics of keeping up a military campaign? The role China plays in all Western economies? We are limited by what we can do. If we could just have China behaving like the UK tomorrow by declaring war on them, and there be no negative consequences then you best believe it would have happened. But in actuality the whole world would descend into madness.
 

So picking a fight with the Chinese would be the "end of us all" but picking a fight with the Middle Eastern/Eastern nations would be a walkover and would not result in the end of all of us?

That's the double standards that Muslims bang on about. The West, Americans in particular see something wrong in China/Russia and can only tall/moan about it but when they see the same thing happening in the Middle East, they get all fired up and start equipping themselves.

So, does this mean that America only picks on the weaker nations who it knows it could destroy easily, which would make them bullies, and not nations which can hurt America real bad if they invade those aforementioned countries?

 
And yes, shock horror, sometimes governments act in their own interests as opposed to universal altruism. This isn't a trait unique to Western countries.

I suggest you research the very recent history (pre WW2) of Latin America, as well as the Middle East/Africa where the ideologies which were not aligned with the Americans were soon deposed of with the arming of rebel troops and assassinations of people who wanted their natural resources to be retained for the empowerment of the citizens and not to further line the pockets of corporate businesses.

How can I explain this to you?

America does not have the power to do anything about China or Russia. To enage in conflict would mean the end of the world. And that is no exageration. Militarily, finacially, socially, the world would collapse. But Middle Eastern nations? There, there we can do something, and so we do. Now I'm not saying the deposition of Saddam was purely philanthropic, but it had elements to it. So it's a mixture of securing our own interests and helping the populace. Now to try that sort of thing against China, that would not be in our interests, and the interests of our citizens have to take priority. That doesn't make us bullies, that makes us pragmatic realists.

Woah, woah, woah. Stop the presses. During the Cold War and the run up to it the American government wasn't very friendly with Communist nations on it's doorstep?

But my point stands, in a perfect, timeless book, written by the perfect messegner of a perfect God, why do we have verses such as these? If I were to write similar verses today in a book I'd be labaled a horrible racist, a short sighted bigot, and yet here it's ok because of the 'context'? Well the problem with this is of course, that Islam claims that the Quran is perfect and timeless, so how can you have any argument of context? Either it's perfect and timeless or it is not, and if it is not then it is full of bile and bigotry.

 

Well, context IS important because it informs us of the scenario which took place and that which led to the revelation of the verse. But I don't need to educate you about treason.

Now, one of the instances where it mentions that to slay the unbelievers is when some of the Jewish tribes of Medina, who had entered into a treaty with the tribes of Medina for it's wholesome protection by ALL the tribes, broke the treaty and helped the Quraysh, the enemy of the Muslims.

Nowadays, this would be considered treason and as we all know, treason used to be carried out by a sentencing to death of the traitor. Now we have all moved on but the concept still remains the same for traitors, life imprisonment or something like that.

Although specifically it does not say in the Quran the punishment of treachery, we can understand, through the use of context in ijtihaad (interpretation) that traitors, who have voluntarily entered into a pact, can be put to death for the betrayal of people they had forged the pact with.

Context does not only rely on the time/place, it can also relate to the events which occurred and through the use of ijtihaad in Islam, or the Talmud in Judaism, it sets a basis which informs people that these books were used by generations before us and will continue to be used by generations after us.
 
 
 
How can I explain this to you?

 

You can start by answering my first question.  

 
America does not have the power to do anything about China or Russia. To enage in conflict would mean the end of the world. And that is no exageration. Militarily, finacially, socially, the world would collapse. But Middle Eastern nations? There, there we can do something, and so we do. Now I'm not saying the deposition of Saddam was purely philanthropic, but it had elements to it. So it's a mixture of securing our own interests and helping the populace. Now to try that sort of thing against China, that would not be in our interests, and the interests of our citizens have to take priority. That doesn't make us bullies, that makes us pragmatic realists.
 

But the British and a few other countries came to the aid of the Jewish people who were being persecuted in Germany even though it might mean that the world collapsing socially or economically. So why can't the American's do that if they are really concerned about the treatment of Chinese/Russians Citizens by their own government?

 
Woah, woah, woah. Stop the presses. During the Cold War and the run up to it the American government wasn't very friendly with Communist nations on it's doorstep?
 

And it seems they STILL don't like ideologies. Even if they aren't on their doorstep any more.

Well, your description of what happened is totally wrong, is it you I've argued this with before? I forget, it's happened so often.

And I understand the use of context in situations as these, but what I'm asking is why such remarks made it into the perfect book, written by the perfect man, who was channelling the perfect God?

The thing is, we are rather trying tp put away those people, but it's not as easy as just saying it. I didn't think that even required a response  

Because the whole sale and obvious genocide of a people is a different thing. Plus, you do know the Holocaust had absoloutly nothing to do with Britain's involvement in WWII? And it's arguabale that it was of negligable importance to the US either. The situations are completley different, come on, surely you can see this.

Can you blame them? Communsim is abhorrent, as is Islamic theocracy and many other ideologies.

Well, that and the fact that Nazi Germany had territorial ambitions. And also they wanted to the world to follow their ideologies and adhere to their wishes.

Sound familiar?

Communists say capitalism is abhorrent.
Capitalists say communism is abhorrent.

See the difference?

And what you are trying to say is that Capitalism is the best ideology ever. Where money grabbing bankers, not all of them, and money grabbing corporate businesses sell lies and steal money from old ladies pensions and exploit the resources of mineral rich countries?

Truth is, everything looks abhorrent if you only evaluate the ideology based on the negative perceptions that you have.

Oh dear, can I just give you the basics? I'm in the middle of homework.

Essentially Mohammed got kicked out Meccah for generally stirring up the populace. Went to Medina, the 3 Jewish tribes were there. These Jewish tribes relied on trade, they were traders, it was their livelyhood. One of their biggest and most important trading partners? Meccans. Now, the Medinans welcomed Mohammed and his followers into the fold, but he brought the Meccans down on them, through his own transgressions. Now the pact they had, which I will add, is disputed to have even existed, the pact said they would not help enemies, they would have amicable relations and so forth. Now Mohammed had essentially destoryed one of their biggest trading routes, and this led the first Jewish tribe to convene in talks with the Meccans, sorry, I forget the tribes' names. The last were the Banu Qurazya though, I remember that. Anyway. So the first Jewish tribe conevened in talks with their trading partnet over the situation that Mohammed had brought them to. For this they were threatened with death if they did not leave, they were exiled. And once they were exiled, guess who took their property? Oh that's right, Mohammed and his followers. Funny, those poor followers who left Mecca with nothing have just managed to bag themselves the property of wealthy merchannts, but hey, let's not be cynical. So something similar happened with the second tribe aswell.

Then we come to the Battle of the Trench. So the Mohammedans and the Banu Qurazya built this fortification. Then came the Meccan forces, out numbering the Mohammedans by 3 to 1. The Banu Qurazya were just traders, and they numbered around 700-900. In the face of this, they removed themselves from the equation. They did not betray Mohammed, they did not fight him. What did they do? They simply removed themselves from the equation. You see, there was never any clause in the 'pact' that required military support, there was no betrayal. Hell, if they had joined the Meccans then Mohammed surely would have been defeated, after all he would have been fighting on two flanks and have been heavily out numbered. But why did the Banu Qurazya withdraw their support? Well, they didn't at first, they refused the advances of the Meccan messengers. But they heeded them when they were told that if they supported Mohammed, they would be utterly destroyed should the Meccans win.

So in that situation, where Mohammed has effectivley crippled their trade, exiled their brother tribes for daring to talk with someone that isn't their enemy, is only Mohammed's enemey, and then being called to help Mohammed against that same force against overwhelming odds with the threat of whole sale slaughter should they lose, well, I see absoloutley nothing wroing with the actions of the Banu Qurazya. Of course, it didn't help them in the end, they were slaughtered just the same. But that, that is what happened, and if you look through your histories you will see this to be true.

The Quran is not a biography of Mohammed, or a historical text though. So I ask again, how can it be perfect with such imperfections within it.

Oh dear, are you honestly comparing the US to Nazi Germany?  

Oh, and I said Communism, not Socialism, so yeah, it's not a case of both sides being equally bad. Capatalism has built this world, it has given you the computer you are typing on, the clothes you wear, the transport you use etc. Capatalism far outstrips any of it's competitors.
 
 
 
Okay we all know Muslims(Yes since to most people Terror=Islam) are deemed by the media to be the biggest threat to world peace, and that they are waging war on everyone in the world.

Okay well picture this Muslims from third world countries with no future feel threatened by everyone and feel they are the ones war is being waged on.

I'm British Muslim I see this from both sides and its pretty childish however thousands of people die because of this animal like 'lets wipe out the threat behavior'.

However there was a time when both the West and the East were at equilibrium in between the medieval dominance of Islam and the Modern Western dominance. It was the time of the Last Caliphate.

Now many people dont understand the Caliphate they see it as an Imperial tool of conquest however the Caliphate was abolished in 1924 at the end of the Empires game( If you dont include the American Empire   ).

The Caliphate is not a starting point for conquest its just at the time conquest was the norm, so you ask why the caliphate why now?

The Caliphate is an Installation of an Islamic superstate free from racial/linguistic divide and in many respects a welfare state An Islamic superstate would give the Muslim Community the ability to have a greater say in UN or even be part of the security council since I believe the Muslims Interests are grossly underrepresented in the UN, thus Terrorism being the only way many see as attracting attention. Muslims account for 1/5 of the world populous yet have almost negligible political influence.

I believe this Caliphate does not even have to be a Nation merely an alliance of Muslim countries and countries with Muslim majorities, to allow for a better representation of Muslims in the global stage.

Remember I explicitly say this not fact its opinion I'm not saying it might.

 

You talk about one Islamic nation as if there are no internal conflicts in the Middle East/Muslim world. I dare say in some cases, some Muslim countries probably hate each other more than they do their 'western enemies' and of course you have the whole Sunni/Shia divide.

And just for your information, the Muslim world is hardly underrepresented at the UN. It's not hard to see that there's an 'Arab-Communist' bloc of nations and Lebanon [representing the Asia and Arab regional bloc] currently heads the SC. Then of course you have things such as the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation which aim [especially the latter] to represent and safeguard the interests of Muslims world wide. It's just too bad these nations use their time at the UN etc to attack Israel, if they cared more about their own people than they did about attacking Israel, then progress would be made.

Of course western foreign policy could probably be changed for the better but change has to come from within. I learned not so long ago that some 90% of Afghans living on the 'front line' were completely oblivious to the reasons for the presence of American troops on their land. What I don't get is that for 'moderate Muslims', your religion has essentially been hijacked yet instead of taking to the streets in massive demonstrations, you're generally silent and in some cases almost in agreement with the sentiment of extremists.
 
 
 
Oh come on, everyone knows that in context, that verse means that Muslims should not take Jews or Christians as their protectorates or close allies in times of war. Nothing to do with general friendship.

 

Thank You for that.

Nice to see that someone understand the verse in it's proper context.
 
 
 
No.
The problem is the shia / sunni thing.

 

lol you've changed your profile picture, i wouldn't call it an upgrade though.

Either it's perfect and timeless or it is not, and if it is not then it is full of bile and bigotry.

 

Have you read the many other verses pertaining to love, charity and helping the poor?

Clearly, you don't have a fair mind. Try reading some commentary.

Every verse has an explanation and deeper meaning. You just pick and choose some verse to serve your Mischievous motives.

Get real.
 
 
My idea for sorting out the world:

Give eveyone cake. People who don't eat cake can have a sandwich or something they will eat. Then, everyone will be too busy eating cake and sandwiches to bomb each other. =]

Not to discredit your theory above but where is your source?

 
The Quran is not a biography of Mohammed, or a historical text though. So I ask again, how can it be perfect with such imperfections within it.
 

You are completely right. That is why we have the Hadeeth, the prophetic traditions.

The Quran was sent as a guide to mankind. It contains information about politics, social, economic, military etc. Though it may seem that it is only relevant to a particular time in history, through the use of Qiyas (analogy) and ijtihaad (interpretation) the Quran can be used by people from the 7th Century to the 65th Century.

By the way, what do you perceive to be imperfections within the Quran?
 
 
 
Oh dear, are you honestly comparing the US to Nazi Germany?  

 

Keeping to the questions I raised in the previous post, answer these questions.

Does the US, like Nazi Germany did, wish to expand their territory through means of invasion, military bases or otherwise?

Does the US, like Nazi Germany did, promote an ideology which was in alignment to their own line of thought?

 
Oh, and I said Communism, not Socialism, so yeah, it's not a case of both sides being equally bad. Capatalism has built this world, it has given you the computer you are typing on, the clothes you wear, the transport you use etc. Capatalism far outstrips any of it's competitors.
 

Well, you could substitute communism/theocracy or any kind of ideology in place of Socialism.

However, Capitalism has also led to rich people getting more rich. It has led to the financial crisis. It has led to greediness, massive risk taking with people's lives/homes amongst other things.

So sure, Capitalism has given me a computer, clothes, transport etc but what it has also given businesses is a monopoly which leads to insecurity of the population who are scared of losing their jobs/homes etc.

We can sit here discussing the merits of Capitalism as opposed to the merits of other ideologies but in the end we will all come to the conclusion that whilst capitalism works and people advance further than ever before, it destroys the concept of community passed down through the ages where people collaborated together for the betterment of mankind.

And I had such high hopes for you, but no, you just dash them.

My dear, of course I know of such verses, but in a point about the flawed nature of verses in the Quran and their immoral contextual and non-contextual meanings I'm going to quote the verses pertinent to said point

It's funny isn't it. How a book so perfect for all of time has to be 'interpreted' away, if it was perfect could it not just be read straight?

Many, many parts of the Quran are incorrect from a scientific stand point. And then we have all the morally ambigious points aswell. Add to that I find the whole notion of Shariah abhorrent, and well, what is perfect about it?

The US wish to secure their own international interests, just as every nation does. They do not seek to invade sovreign nations and add them to an Empire.

And yes the US promote what they believe to be a correct ideology. As do Muslims. Infact, Islam seeks to dominate the world, to spread and have a world Caphilate. So any parrallels drawn between the US and NAzi Germany can equally be drawn between Islam and Nazi Germany. Infact far more can be drawn between Islam and Nazi ideology, so it's a dangerous game you;re playing. I'll not do so, for fear of someone later shouting about Godwin's Law, but if you carry on down this path then I will.

Capatalism has led to everyone getting rich. Just compare life in the Western world 200 years ago to life today. Community? Pah. This is such a silly point. Of course the promotion of the individual degrades a sense of togetherness, but this is a fialing of social policy, not economic system. Do you honestly think that Socialist countries have better social situations, well I'll tell you now, they do not, and never have. This talk about the progression of man kind. Just take a quick look, where has 95% of all human progression come from? Oh that's right, Capatalist nations. Capatalism is not perfect, but it has given the world everything.
 
 
 
Yes British Imperialism was the root cause of almost all world problems today its true but no one admits it.

 

What, like Zimbabwe?
 
 
 
What, like Zimbabwe?

 

Yes
 
 
 
Yes

 

lol no
 
 
muslims have brought this on themselves. I'm not shedding any tears.
 
 
 
Yes

 

Yeah, if it wasn't for the British Empire Zimbabwe would've been a lot better, some may have called it the breadbasket of Africa. Yeah, I completely agree with you there.
 
 
 
What, like Zimbabwe?

 

no, you can't include zimbabwe.... that is down that that racist anti-white mugabe stealing land from white people..

My theory?   I love how yours was the definative story and you label mine theory. Anyway, this series of events is taken from your Islamic histories and Hadith, with input from maps of the area, knowing the culture and behaviour of the poopulace and so on.

 

Oh dear, you've just gone and contradicted yourself.

My version cannot possibly be considered a "theory" because I have replicated the story which is related in the Quran and which can be considered a historical text.

Your "theory", on the other hand is just that, a theory. So far, you have not stated any sources, although you do claim the hadeeth/islamic texts back your version. But how can they, when I have just narrated the story to you from the Quran/Hadeeth.

Further, how can you possibly know the "culture and behaviour of the populace" when they were living in the 7th Century? For starters, you do not even know the events that took place.

 
It's funny isn't it. How a book so perfect for all of time has to be 'interpreted' away, if it was perfect could it not just be read straight?
 

Then we would be all like robots, doing the same thing repetitively and that does get a bit tedious.  

The Quran would never be a perfect book if it could "just be read straight". That would mean that Islam would be very rigid and would be uncompromising in certain situations.

However, the Quran is perfect in the sense that it is flexible to accommodate the world at any given time. It is also perfect in the sense that there is no strict code to follow, it allows the user ease of access in all areas of life.

 
Many, many parts of the Quran are incorrect from a scientific stand point. And then we have all the morally ambigious points aswell. Add to that I find the whole notion of Shariah abhorrent, and well, what is perfect about it?
 

Why don't you give me something to work with?

Scientific stand point, ambiguous points, shariah?

Give me one or two examples and then we can discuss them, if you wish.
 
 
This is my first VIRAL post
 
 
 
The US wish to secure their own international interests, just as every nation does. They do not seek to invade sovreign nations and add them to an Empire.

 

But secure their "international interests" through the use of military force, assassinations, blackmail, threats etc?  

In addition, they ACTIVELY seek to invade sovereign nations to secure their interests.

 
And yes the US promote what they believe to be a correct ideology. As do Muslims. Infact, Islam seeks to dominate the world, to spread and have a world Caphilate. So any parrallels drawn between the US and NAzi Germany can equally be drawn between Islam and Nazi Germany. Infact far more can be drawn between Islam and Nazi ideology, so it's a dangerous game you;re playing. I'll not do so, for fear of someone later shouting about Godwin's Law, but if you carry on down this path then I will.
 

The Caliphate. Now you want to argue about the Caliphate? God, this is going to be so interesting.

Help me understand what is so wrong about the Caliphate.

 
Capatalism has led to everyone getting rich. Just compare life in the Western world 200 years ago to life today. Community? Pah. This is such a silly point. Of course the promotion of the individual degrades a sense of togetherness, but this is a fialing of social policy, not economic system. Do you honestly think that Socialist countries have better social situations, well I'll tell you now, they do not, and never have. This talk about the progression of man kind. Just take a quick look, where has 95% of all human progression come from? Oh that's right, Capatalist nations. Capatalism is not perfect, but it has given the world everything.
 

Why compare only the Western world? Has the Western world always been so advanced?

Humans always progressed. From sticks and stones to rockets and guns. From caves to apartments. From camp fire to Aga's. Humans will always progress. It's not only "Capitalist" nations which have made 95% of human progression.

Tell me, if the first humans have capitalist ideologies which persuaded them to move from caves into rudimentary housing and this further expanded into communities which lead to the creation of towns/cities? Did capitalism exist back then as well?
 
 
 
Oh dear, you've just gone and contradicted yourself.

My version cannot possibly be considered a &quot;theory&quot; because I have replicated the story which is related in the Quran and which can be considered a historical text.

Your &quot;theory&quot;, on the other hand is just that, a theory. So far, you have not stated any sources, although you do claim the hadeeth/islamic texts back your version. But how can they, when I have just narrated the story to you from the Quran/Hadeeth.

Further, how can you possibly know the &quot;culture and behaviour of the populace&quot; when they were living in the 7th Century? For starters, you do not even know the events that took place.

Then we would be all like robots, doing the same thing repetitively and that does get a bit tedious.  

The Quran would never be a perfect book if it could &quot;just be read straight&quot;. That would mean that Islam would be very rigid and would be uncompromising in certain situations.

However, the Quran is perfect in the sense that it is flexible to accommodate the world at any given time. It is also perfect in the sense that there is no strict code to follow, it allows the user ease of access in all areas of life.

Why don't you give me something to work with?

Scientific stand point, ambiguous points, shariah?

Give me one or two examples and then we can discuss them, if you wish.

 

How have I contradicted myself?  

No see, you're wuite wrong here. The version I narrate also comes from the Quran, Hadith and Islamic histories, but with an objective viewpoint, rather than one of demonic Jews and a perfect Mohammed. I mean, if you could say, quote a verse where the Banu Quarzya were violent toward MOhammed, then I would be impressed. But you see, you cannot argue against my version of events, because it is based in your Islamic facts, just a different interpretation of them.

And I'm talking of course, in the light of historical texts.   I'm not saying I know about their daily struggles for life, but I am saying with a relative understanding as regards how trade worked then, the sociatal norms and so forth.  

So what you mean of course is that the Quran, is infact, changable? After all, if it is flexible in so many situations, that means it is not singular, therefor chanagable and therefor imperfect. Because a perfect text would have no need of interpretation to change it. You're definition of perfect is so damn warped.

Ok then. The scientific inaccuracies as regards the process of pregnancy and birth. The moral questionability of the punishments laid down in Shariah and from what logical basis Homosexuals and polyigamists are discriminated against. Oh, and how one reconciles slavery with Islam, when it is clear within the Quran that slavery is acceptable in Islam, and how is that then reconciled with a perfect and moral God.

 
But secure their &quot;international interests&quot; through the use of military force, assassinations, blackmail, threats etc?  

In addition, they ACTIVELY seek to invade sovereign nations to secure their interests.

The Caliphate. Now you want to argue about the Caliphate? God, this is going to be so interesting.

Help me understand what is so wrong about the Caliphate.

Why compare only the Western world? Has the Western world always been so advanced?

Humans always progressed. From sticks and stones to rockets and guns. From caves to apartments. From camp fire to Aga's. Humans will always progress. It's not only &quot;Capitalist&quot; nations which have made 95% of human progression.

Tell me, if the first humans have capitalist ideologies which persuaded them to move from caves into rudimentary housing and this further expanded into communities which lead to the creation of towns/cities? Did capitalism exist back then as well?

 

As does every nation  

And no, they do not. They activley sought to invade another nation with the support of the UN and NATO in order that they may ensure their own security. Quite different to the unprovoked invasion of a neighboring nation as a land grabbing excersise.  

I've not said there is anything inherently wrong with it. Just that Islam seeks to dominate the world and have a single world Caphilate, as mandated by the Quran. So how is that any different to any nation seeking to futher their own aims and ideologies?

The Western world because we are the most advanced. The East has been held back by Socialism and petty tribal differences, the Middle East, well let's just not go there   Africa, is well, Africa, and South America, well they've had their trouble with Socialists aswell. So the Western world  

Of course we have always progressed, but from the first foundings of civilisation there has been captalism. It is what drives humanity. Because nature has given us an imperative, to survive, to thrive, to be selfish and secure our own needs. I embrace that, and seek to overcome it. I don't deny it. Except in a few cases I will always put myself before others, I will then put my friends and family before others, then my countrymen and those sharing similar beliefs. Just as you would. Capatalism is just an extension of a perfectly natural and accepted social concept.
 
 
 
How have I contradicted myself?  

 

You state that your story is NOT a theory. However, you mentioned that "by knowing the culture and the populace", you manufactured a story/theory along them lines after refusing to accept the version which is mentioned in the Quran and which can be considered very reliable.

Compare that to your claims that "by knowing the culture and the populace", you arrived at your own conclusions. How in the Earth did you manage to know the culture and populace at that point in history? Did you base your assumptions on the present Jews of today?

So as far as I and many others are concerned, your theory about the Jews of Medina will remain exactly that, a theory.

 
No see, you're wuite wrong here. The version I narrate also comes from the Quran, Hadith and Islamic histories, but with an objective viewpoint, rather than one of demonic Jews and a perfect Mohammed. I mean, if you could say, quote a verse where the Banu Quarzya were violent toward MOhammed, then I would be impressed. But you see, you cannot argue against my version of events, because it is based in your Islamic facts, just a different interpretation of them.
 

But if we were to take your main point, that all events are viewed with a subjective viewpoint, then history as we know it is completely wrong because you claim "history should be viewed from an objective viewpoint". There is no way on earth that anyone can be objective about history. As I pointed out before, history is remembered only by the victors.

But getting back to the point, even if you are sceptical of any pact between the Jews of Medina and the Muslims, bring evidence to establish this claim. We, the Muslims, along with many historians can substantiate our claim that the treaty existed. You, on the other hand cannot and do not have a platform to speak on.

 
And I'm talking of course, in the light of historical texts.   I'm not saying I know about their daily struggles for life, but I am saying with a relative understanding as regards how trade worked then, the sociatal norms and so forth.  
 

So you are a fully qualified historian/economist on the subject of the Jews of Medina?  

Unless that's the case, you are just making assumptions which again, surprise, surprise, you cannot prove.

 
So what you mean of course is that the Quran, is infact, changable? After all, if it is flexible in so many situations, that means it is not singular, therefor chanagable and therefor imperfect. Because a perfect text would have no need of interpretation to change it. You're definition of perfect is so damn warped.
 

I don't think you quite get it. The Quran ITSELF is NOT changeable. Just the way the Muslims view things and you seem to have missed that point.

I can see that your struggling with this concept: Let me break it down for you.

Just say that you have found a "manual of life" which contains all the problems and solutions, at that particular time. You strive to follow it because obviously, you want to succeed through life and it has all the answers. After living a fulfilling life of 90 odd years, you pass away and the "manual" is inherited by your descendent. Now, as one would imagine, society constantly evolves and some of the problems listed in the "manual of life" won't affect you but some new problems, EVOLVED FROM some of the old problems have come to surface. Now the descendant is in a predicament. The "manual of life" contains no solutions because the original problem has evoluted into something else. The author has allowed interpretation on some aspects of the "manual" and they use this to overcome their problem and this carries on and on and on. Although for some things, no exact problem is listed and no exact solution is listed, through the use of wisdom and interpretation, people can arrive at a solution for their problem.

Would the above not be a demonstration of a "perfect book"?

Now, your other point about my definition of "perfect" being warped. I suggest you consult a dictionary so I can explain my point.

Perfect: " conforming absolutely to the description or definition of an ideal type "

The Quran is a book for ALL people, but it recognizes that people ARE different and some may have better qualities than others. Others may possess qualities which others may not possess. But all look to the Quran for guidance.

In an "ideal/perfect" society, there would be no crime and everything would be hanky-panky. But the Quran recognizes that there is NO "ideal/perfect" society. Therefore, it has allowed a leeway through the use of Qiyas (analogy) and ijtihaad (interpretation) because it recognizes that society is not perfect.

 
Ok then. The scientific inaccuracies as regards the process of pregnancy and birth. The moral questionability of the punishments laid down in Shariah and from what logical basis Homosexuals and polyigamists are discriminated against. Oh, and how one reconciles slavery with Islam, when it is clear within the Quran that slavery is acceptable in Islam, and how is that then reconciled with a perfect and moral God.
 

Woah, hold your horses, Let's take one point at a time.

Start with the pregnancy/birth. Give evidence of what the inaccuracies are. Once you have it, and then we can proceed onto the others.
 
 
 
As does every nation  

 

Hmm, I can list various South American/Asian/Middle Eastern/African states which do not use the above methods to accommodate their international interests.

Oh look, what a surprise. They are mostly third world nations whose resources have been bled dry by the majority Northern Hemisphere countries.

 
And no, they do not. They activley sought to invade another nation with the support of the UN and NATO in order that they may ensure their own security. Quite different to the unprovoked invasion of a neighboring nation as a land grabbing excersise.  
 

I apologise for using profanity but I have to say it.

**** you, sir. Research the recent history of the unprovoked invasion of Panama by the surprise, surprise, Americans.

What security threat did the Iraqi's bring to America?

Surely, if the hijackers of planes on 9/11 were Saudi Arabian, the funding came from Saudi Arabian ruling elite, their brains were warped with wahabi ideologies founded IN Saudi Arabia, surely THAT WOULD BE A JUSTIFIED THREAT TO US SECURITY?

But no, they went and invaded, occupied, and got bogged down in the backwaters of the ignorant, Afghanistan.

 
I've not said there is anything inherently wrong with it. Just that Islam seeks to dominate the world and have a single world Caphilate, as mandated by the Quran. So how is that any different to any nation seeking to futher their own aims and ideologies?
 

Islam had a Caliphate but then it got torn up into war ravaged countries which is the Middle East now. Divide and conquer, the old adage goes.

Do you think the Islamic concept of Caliphate should be destroyed as done with the Nazi Germany ideology?

 
The Western world because we are the most advanced. The East has been held back by Socialism and petty tribal differences, the Middle East, well let's just not go there   Africa, is well, Africa, and South America, well they've had their trouble with Socialists aswell. So the Western world  
 

Well, first of all we have to measure the advancement of something. If we apply "technology" and all that, then undoubtedly it is the Western World. But is that the only measure that we can use.

Why don't we use happiness? Surely, if we are the most advanced, we should be relaxing and letting machines do the work. But hey guess what, most of us are out of our minds working whilst the peasants/monks in Africa, India, South America, Middle East are CONTENT with their life.

But are we, the most advanced nations on earth CONTENT with all the wealth and luxuries that we have accumulated. No, we are not.

So what does that show about our state of life. The further we advance, the less contented we will be and the more miserable we'll become. But so what, we ARE advancing right?

 
Of course we have always progressed, but from the first foundings of civilisation there has been captalism. It is what drives humanity. Because nature has given us an imperative, to survive, to thrive, to be selfish and secure our own needs. I embrace that, and seek to overcome it. I don't deny it. Except in a few cases I will always put myself before others, I will then put my friends and family before others, then my countrymen and those sharing similar beliefs. Just as you would. Capatalism is just an extension of a perfectly natural and accepted social concept.
 

But it depends what kind of capitalism we are discussing. The capitalism which has led to the advancement of Apple products vs Microsoft (Sad that Steve Jobs died today) or the capitalism which has lead to the financial crisis. But then that's a pit headed disaster. If you go to regulate Capitalism, then creativity cannot come about but if left unregulated, then it leads to advancement at the expense of many factors.

Woah, hold your horses, Let's take one point at a time.

Start with the pregnancy/birth. Give evidence of what the inaccuracies are. Once you have it, and then we can proceed onto the others.

 

Ahh right, so taking a source in context is something only you can do is it?    

And no, I'm basing my context on what I have read in history books about the lifestyle at the time, the customs and so forth. You know, a real history book though, not some biased rubbish like the Quran or Hadith  

Well yes, this is true. But then Muslims were the victors, and you take your version with full acceptence from an Islamic interpretationb of an Islamic source. Why, your version could hardly be more biased? You've just addmitted this surely? Oh, and do go ahead and substaniate then  

Ok, so are you? You see, crazy as this may sound here, you don;t have to devote your life to studying something in order to have a basic understanding of it. If you do, then well, you;re a bit of a retard  

But what then about slavery? That is a-ok by the Quran. In plain terms. You see what you Muslims do, is not interpret the true meaning, it's twist to your own ends. By that definition, how is the Quran any more perfect than any other Holy book? What essentially you mean therefor is that the Quran is not perfect, it does not fit perfectly, you have to make it fit. Which again I say, is not perfection. If I get a pair of shoes, I wouldn;t say they're perfect if I have to lop the toe off because they are too small, a perfect pair of shoes would fit perfectly without any adjustment.

You asked for a few  

Sura 22:5 says "We created you out of dust, then out of sperm, then out of a leech-like clot, then from a morsel of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed... and We cause whom We will to rest in the wombs for an appointed term, then do We bring you out as babes." Sura 23:13-14 repeats this idea by saying God "placed him as (a drop of) sperm (nutfah) in a place of rest, firmly fixed; then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood (alaqa); then out of that clot We made a lump (mudghah), then We made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh; then We developed out of it another creature."

You hardly have to be an embryologist to see how wrong these descriptions are.

 
Hmm, I can list various South American/Asian/Middle Eastern/African states which do not use the above methods to accommodate their international interests.

Oh look, what a surprise. They are mostly third world nations whose resources have been bled dry by the majority Northern Hemisphere countries.

But then that's a pit headed disaster. If you go to regulate Capitalism, then creativity cannot come about but if left unregulated, then it leads to advancement at the expense of many factors.

 

Wait, what's this crazieness? You mean countries without the means to do something don;t do it? Well, thanks for that one sherlock  

Iraq had Saddam in. Who was refusing to cooperate with the West, committing genocide, had illegal chemical weapons etc

Afghanistan? Innocent little Afghanistan? Because it totally didn't have an Islamic theocratic regime in place training and funding international Jihadist terrorists right?  

Well, I certainly hope Islam itself dissapears soon enough, so of course I wouldn't want to see another Caphilate.

Well I;m using GDP, quality of life and so on. Undoubtably that put's the West ahead of the game. Isolated monastries full of 'high off God monks' don;t really count toward the advancement of a country. And of course we're not 'happy', it's the human condition to want more. But we are more advanced and we are better off. It's undeniable.

Either way it's Capatalism, you started off blaming Capatalism, and now you are trying to blame only form of Capatalism? Poor form dear sir. Capatalism in itself is the driving factor behind almost all of human advancement in the last mellenium in one form or another. When there is drive to have the best of something, the most cost effective and so on, you get ever better products. When wealth is created and there is more wealth around, you get a better standard of life, more to spend, which means more spent on ever better products. This is Capatalism at it's finest. Now there are flaws, monopolies and so forth, which is why I have stated that Capatalism is not perfect, but it is the best system we have, and to blame the entire system for a failure here and there is nothing short of retarded.
 
 
 
Ahh right, so taking a source in context is something only you can do is it?    

 

Well, you don't seem to be doing it. Cherry picking verses from the Quran as if it was an entirely hate filled book.

 
And no, I'm basing my context on what I have read in history books about the lifestyle at the time, the customs and so forth. You know, a real history book though, not some biased rubbish like the Quran or Hadith  
 

WHAT history books have you actually read from that time period? Tell me, I want to know where you're getting this information from?

 
Well yes, this is true. But then Muslims were the victors, and you take your version with full acceptence from an Islamic interpretationb of an Islamic source. Why, your version could hardly be more biased? You've just addmitted this surely? Oh, and do go ahead and substaniate then  
 

Well first of all, my claim can be substantiated by the Quran/Hadeeth.

Secondly, seeing as no other "version" exists - I may be ignorant, if so, then correct me - we may as well take what the Quran is saying to be true.

 
Ok, so are you? You see, crazy as this may sound here, you don;t have to devote your life to studying something in order to have a basic understanding of it. If you do, then well, you;re a bit of a retard  
 

I'm not telling people that they have to "devote" their life to gain an understanding of something but rather, they have to "EDUCATE" themselves about the various aspects of the subject they are studying for. Just "gaining a basic understanding" of something does not make you something of an expert as you tried to demonstrate with the other version of the story.

 
But what then about slavery? That is a-ok by the Quran. In plain terms. You see what you Muslims do, is not interpret the true meaning, it's twist to your own ends. By that definition, how is the Quran any more perfect than any other Holy book? What essentially you mean therefor is that the Quran is not perfect, it does not fit perfectly, you have to make it fit. Which again I say, is not perfection. If I get a pair of shoes, I wouldn;t say they're perfect if I have to lop the toe off because they are too small, a perfect pair of shoes would fit perfectly without any adjustment.
 

We'll come to slavery later.

The Quran itself IS perfect. But the people who recite and interpret the Quran are imperfect in the sense that as style/tastes/culture evolve, the Quran's meaning has to evolve to fit modern times. However, the basis of the interpretation remains the same because essentially, the interpretation is an extension of the original meaning. A more elaborate explanation, if you like.

Well, regarding the shoe analogy, I get my shoes tailor made. Perfect.  

 
You asked for a few  
 

That was before I realised you had so many issues.  

 
Sura 22:5 says "We created you out of dust, then out of sperm, then out of a leech-like clot, then from a morsel of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed... and We cause whom We will to rest in the wombs for an appointed term, then do We bring you out as babes." Sura 23:13-14 repeats this idea by saying God "placed him as (a drop of) sperm (nutfah) in a place of rest, firmly fixed; then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood (alaqa); then out of that clot We made a lump (mudghah), then We made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh; then We developed out of it another creature."

You hardly have to be an embryologist to see how wrong these descriptions are.
 

Dude, I don't know whose "Quran" you've been reading.

Surah 22:5 goes like this:

"O people, if you have any doubt about resurrection, (remember that) we created you from dust, and subsequently from a tiny drop, which turns into a hanging (embryo), then it becomes a fetus that is given life or deemed lifeless. We thus clarify things for you. We settle in the wombs whatever we will for a predetermined period.* We then bring you out as infants, then you reach maturity. While some of you die young, others live to the worst age, only to find out that no more knowledge can be attained beyond a certain limit. Also, you look at a land that is dead, then as soon as we shower it with water, it vibrates with life and grows all kinds of beautiful plants."

Accompanying explanation of the creation of an embryo:  http://www.quranmiracles.com/2011/03...ee-darknesses/ 

Surah 23:13-14:

"Subsequently, we reproduced him from a tiny drop, that is placed into a well protected repository.

Then we developed the drop into a hanging (embryo), then developed the hanging (embryo) into a bite-size (fetus), then created the bite-size (fetus) into bones, then covered the bones with flesh. We thus produce a new creature. Most blessed is GOD, the best Creator."

Explain to me the problem.
 
 
If America didn't support Israel there would be very little threat of Islamic terrorism to the Western World
 
 
 
Wait, what's this crazieness? You mean countries without the means to do something don;t do it? Well, thanks for that one sherlock  

 

Does that make it right for the ones that do have the means, they should use that means?

 
Iraq had Saddam in. Who was refusing to cooperate with the West, committing genocide, had illegal chemical weapons etc
 

Does everyone have to cooperate with the West? Gosh, you're starting to sound like an Islamist who calls for a Caliphate.

Saddam wasn't the first to commit genocide, nor will he be the last. Genocides are happening in Africa every single bloody day yet has the supreme Americans turned their laser sights there, no?

Forget chemical. Think nuclear. Israel still do not declare whether they have nuclear weapons. Does that make them "illegal nuclear weapons"?

 
Afghanistan? Innocent little Afghanistan? Because it totally didn't have an Islamic theocratic regime in place training and funding international Jihadist terrorists right?  
 

Ooh, what happened to your research about Panama and the hijackers of the planes on 9/11?

Having an Islamic theocratic regime is not a crime itself. Let's apply your policy to Iran. Why don't the Americans invade?

But back to the your point it suited the Americans real good when they were firing RPG's into the backyard of the soviets who were imperialists. Guess who's taken their place now? America. So really, you could claim that Al Qaeda are not religious warriors, although they do use verses from the Quran, but they are anti-imperialists.

And do you still believe that Saudi Arabia should have been invaded rather than Afghanistan?

 
Well, I certainly hope Islam itself dissapears soon enough, so of course I wouldn't want to see another Caphilate.
 

But what if 99.99% of the Middle East wanted it back? Would there be war?

 
Well I;m using GDP, quality of life and so on. Undoubtably that put's the West ahead of the game. Isolated monastries full of 'high off God monks' don;t really count toward the advancement of a country. And of course we're not 'happy', it's the human condition to want more. But we are more advanced and we are better off. It's undeniable.
 

But peasants are happy with their life. They don't want more.

Of course it's deniable that we are the most advanced. But once upon a time, Japan/China was the most advanced, then it was the Greeks, then the Muslims, then Europe, then the West. Someone is always going to pip you to the top.

 
Either way it's Capatalism, you started off blaming Capatalism, and now you are trying to blame only form of Capatalism? Poor form dear sir. Capatalism in itself is the driving factor behind almost all of human advancement in the last mellenium in one form or another. When there is drive to have the best of something, the most cost effective and so on, you get ever better products. When wealth is created and there is more wealth around, you get a better standard of life, more to spend, which means more spent on ever better products. This is Capatalism at it's finest. Now there are flaws, monopolies and so forth, which is why I have stated that Capatalism is not perfect, but it is the best system we have, and to blame the entire system for a failure here and there is nothing short of retarded.
 

I did not blame capitalism. I was just highlighting the negative aspects of capitalism.
 
 
 
Well, you don't seem to be doing it. Cherry picking verses from the Quran as if it was an entirely hate filled book.

WHAT history books have you actually read from that time period? Tell me, I want to know where you're getting this information from?

Well first of all, my claim can be substantiated by the Quran/Hadeeth.

Secondly, seeing as no other &quot;version&quot; exists - I may be ignorant, if so, then correct me - we may as well take what the Quran is saying to be true.

I'm not telling people that they have to &quot;devote&quot; their life to gain an understanding of something but rather, they have to &quot;EDUCATE&quot; themselves about the various aspects of the subject they are studying for. Just &quot;gaining a basic understanding&quot; of something does not make you something of an expert as you tried to demonstrate with the other version of the story.

We'll come to slavery later.

The Quran itself IS perfect. But the people who recite and interpret the Quran are imperfect in the sense that as style/tastes/culture evolve, the Quran's meaning has to evolve to fit modern times. However, the basis of the interpretation remains the same because essentially, the interpretation is an extension of the original meaning. A more elaborate explanation, if you like.

Well, regarding the shoe analogy, I get my shoes tailor made. Perfect.  

That was before I realised you had so many issues.  

Dude, I don't know whose &quot;Quran&quot; you've been reading.

Surah 22:5 goes like this:

&quot;O people, if you have any doubt about resurrection, (remember that) we created you from dust, and subsequently from a tiny drop, which turns into a hanging (embryo), then it becomes a fetus that is given life or deemed lifeless. We thus clarify things for you. We settle in the wombs whatever we will for a predetermined period.* We then bring you out as infants, then you reach maturity. While some of you die young, others live to the worst age, only to find out that no more knowledge can be attained beyond a certain limit. Also, you look at a land that is dead, then as soon as we shower it with water, it vibrates with life and grows all kinds of beautiful plants.&quot;

Accompanying explanation of the creation of an embryo:  http://www.quranmiracles.com/2011/03...ee-darknesses/ 

Surah 23:13-14:

&quot;Subsequently, we reproduced him from a tiny drop, that is placed into a well protected repository.

Then we developed the drop into a hanging (embryo), then developed the hanging (embryo) into a bite-size (fetus), then created the bite-size (fetus) into bones, then covered the bones with flesh. We thus produce a new creature. Most blessed is GOD, the best Creator.&quot;

Explain to me the problem.

 

  Are you really that dense? Do try and understand, when I'm talking about inperfections, abhorrent verses and such like, crazy as it may seem, it's those verses I'll focus on. Just like if a book has 100 pages on how to grow Tomatos but just a paragraph on how best to get away with murder, I'll focus on that single paragraph.

Ishaq and Bukahri. So Hadith and Islamic histories.

  Have you actually read the verses in the Hadith and Quran? You realise what you describe is not what is written, not at all? You are interpreting what is written and creating a wider narrative, I do the same. And surprise surprise, but I don;t quite take an Islamic source on Mohammed doing a morally questionable thing at face value  

How have I tried to demonstrate myself as an expert? Because I;ve disagreed with what you;ve been indoctrinated to believe? Trust me hear, you need be no expert to see the holes in your telling of the story.

Ahh right. So it#s perfect but there's no way for it to demonstrate it's perfection. Well isn;t that just damn handy?  

Do you have any idea how a human featus is formed? Because it is certainly not what that Surah describes. Just give it a quick google.

 
Does that make it right for the ones that do have the means, they should use that means?

Does everyone have to cooperate with the West? Gosh, you're starting to sound like an Islamist who calls for a Caliphate.

Saddam wasn't the first to commit genocide, nor will he be the last. Genocides are happening in Africa every single bloody day yet has the supreme Americans turned their laser sights there, no?

Forget chemical. Think nuclear. Israel still do not declare whether they have nuclear weapons. Does that make them &quot;illegal nuclear weapons&quot;?

Ooh, what happened to your research about Panama and the hijackers of the planes on 9/11?

Having an Islamic theocratic regime is not a crime itself. Let's apply your policy to Iran. Why don't the Americans invade?

But back to the your point it suited the Americans real good when they were firing RPG's into the backyard of the soviets who were imperialists. Guess who's taken their place now? America. So really, you could claim that Al Qaeda are not religious warriors, although they do use verses from the Quran, but they are anti-imperialists.

And do you still believe that Saudi Arabia should have been invaded rather than Afghanistan?

But what if 99.99% of the Middle East wanted it back? Would there be war?

But peasants are happy with their life. They don't want more.

Of course it's deniable that we are the most advanced. But once upon a time, Japan/China was the most advanced, then it was the Greeks, then the Muslims, then Europe, then the West. Someone is always going to pip you to the top.

I did not blame capitalism. I was just highlighting the negative aspects of capitalism.

 

True enough, but your implication was that it was a choice for them not to what the US does, which is obviously not true.

Oh no, they don;t have to, but it's in their best interests. I'm not condoning what America did, but it's just securing their own interests. You seem to live in a rosy world of ideals.

And yes they are, but it's what we can do. We've tried to intervene in Congo, the Congalese wont have it. Similar in other places to. Add to that the cost of such a war and the political fallout, the fact that Africa is such a bloomin mess that once we went in we could never leave etc, and well, you have a few good reasons for not getting involved.

I wondered how long it would be until Israel found it's way into this debate   Well mayhaps, but then Israel can be trusted not to turn them on us, and that's all we really worry about to be honest.

As I've said, the US securing it's own intersts, not in a Facist Imperialist way, but through normal international subterfuge. And yes, I know about the 9/11 hijackers, but they were trained, harboured and endorsed by the Afghan Taliban.

It should be.

And once again, shock horror, the US funded people who wanted to hurt those they also wanted to hurt? Madness. Pure madness. Actually they didn;t fund AQ, they funded the Mujahadeen, and they are not anti-imperialists, they are religious fundamentalists that see their land as their Islamic right. Who see everyone else as a dirty kuffar that needs to be done away with.

When have I ever said that I believe that?   Of course I don;t, it would never have been feasible.

Why would there be war? Have your little Caphilate so long as it doesn't try to expand, but then of course, at some point Islamic interests will come into conflict with the rest of the world, then there might be war.

Are they though? You make such a broad statement, have you any proof of such a claim? The Western world is the most advanced at the moment, based on a summation of all factors considered. Yes, other parts of the world have been more advanced at times, and generally, the regoin with the most advancement has the best things. I don;t see what that has to do with anything.

Oh yes you did, do you want me to find your original post?

But that's taking a subjective view on one part of a text. You have to look at the Quran OBJECTIVELY in the sense that you look at it as a whole, rather than each individual piece.

It's like an apple. It's got skin, pips, perhaps a stalk but at then end of the day, when someone asks you what is this? You don't reply "pips, skin and stalk", you say it's an apple.

 
Ishaq and Bukahri. So Hadith and Islamic histories.
 

But was Ishaq reliable?

The most widely discussed criticism of his sīra was that of his contemporary Malik ibn Anas.[3] Malik rejected the stories of Muhammad and the J ews of Medina on ground that they were taken solely based on accounts by sons of Jewish converts.[11] These same stories have also been denounced as "odd tales" (gharāʾib) later by ibn Hajar al-Asqalani.[11] Malik and others also thought that ibn Isḥaq exhibited Qadari and Shi'i tendencies (Guillaume also found evidence of this, p.xxii,xxiv),[3] and relied too heavily on the Isra'iliyat. Furthermore, early literary critics, like ibn Sallam al-Jumahi and ibn al-Nadim, censured ibn Isḥaq for knowingly including forged poems in his biography,[3] and for attributing poems to persons not known to have written any poetry.[9] The 14th-century historian al-Dhahabi, using hadith terminology, noted that in addition to the forged (makthūb) poetry, Ibn Ishaq filled his sīra with many munqaṭiʿ and munkar reports.[12]

And further, did Imam Bukhari collect any of the hadeeths actually narrated by Ibn Ishaq?

However, analysis of his isnad (chain of transmission) has given him the negative distinction of being a mudallis, meaning one who did not name his teacher, claiming instead to narrate directly from his teacher's teacher.[15] Because of his tadlīs, many scholars including Muhammad al-Bukhari hardly ever used his narrations in their sahih books.

 
  Have you actually read the verses in the Hadith and Quran? You realise what you describe is not what is written, not at all? You are interpreting what is written and creating a wider narrative, I do the same. And surprise surprise, but I don;t quite take an Islamic source on Mohammed doing a morally questionable thing at face value  
 

Let me give you the short version and one which you'll probably agree with.

Many historians suggest that the Jewish tribe committed treason because they failed to keep themselves neutral or they actively helped the Meccans whom they thought could overrun Medina. However, this did not come to pass and their punishment was that which was inscribed in the Holy Judaic book, the Torah.

 
How have I tried to demonstrate myself as an expert? Because I;ve disagreed with what you;ve been indoctrinated to believe? Trust me hear, you need be no expert to see the holes in your telling of the story.
 

Indoctrinated? My dear fellow, that is unworthy of a response.

 
Ahh right. So it#s perfect but there's no way for it to demonstrate it's perfection. Well isn;t that just damn handy?  
 

Would you say a book which preaches the right path, whatever that may be, can be read by adults/teenagers, contains all the problems and solutions and claims no other author can possibly create another paragraph like that contained in the book and above all, is timeless, would that constitute to a "perfect book"?

 
Do you have any idea how a human featus is formed? Because it is certainly not what that Surah describes. Just give it a quick google.
 

Do you not understand what the "tiny drop" alludes to?

Maybe it's semen and God is talking about just a "tiny drop". Although males release millions of sperms, only one, a tiny little thing is enough for conception.

Or maybe you did not understand the "hanging embryo" part?

Look at pictures of embryonic development in the female body and you'll see that in the first few weeks, the embryo appears to hang and indeed it does throughout the entire stage of pregnancy because there is a clear separation between the embryo and other organs of the body where the fluids travel to and from.

 http://www.slideshare.net/catherinep...y-presentation 

Now the question is, do YOU now realise that the Quran is just waiting for Science to fill in the blanks?  
 
 
 
True enough, but your implication was that it was a choice for them not to what the US does, which is obviously not true.

 

Do you think that it will remain status quo or will these "oppressed nations" start to revolt?

And if so, is America better to remove itself from the various conflicts it will be embroiled in (they have many international interests) or will they fight tooth and nail to the end?

 
Oh no, they don;t have to, but it's in their best interests. I'm not condoning what America did, but it's just securing their own interests. You seem to live in a rosy world of ideals.
 

That's like a double edged sword, isn't it?

Either the leaders of an improvised nation toe the American line and get "aid" which will be used to kill the anti-imperialist populace or they reject the Americans, win the populace support and wait for an invasion.

Talk about being between a rock and a hard place.

Just curious, if you were the leader of a country set out in the scenario above, which route would you follow:

1) Being a harsh dictator by following the Americans
2) Endorsing the population's ideals and risk the threat of invasion.

 
And yes they are, but it's what we can do. We've tried to intervene in Congo, the Congalese wont have it. Similar in other places to. Add to that the cost of such a war and the political fallout, the fact that Africa is such a bloomin mess that once we went in we could never leave etc, and well, you have a few good reasons for not getting involved.
 

But on the other hand, the Iraqi populace didn't want the Americans, they still don't. The war cost so much, both in monetary and casualties and the Americans stayed around 7 odd years in Iraq, so WHY DID Americans get involved in the war in Iraq and not the Congolese, if the situations are both similar?

 
I wondered how long it would be until Israel found it's way into this debate   Well mayhaps, but then Israel can be trusted not to turn them on us, and that's all we really worry about to be honest.
 

So the dog won't bite it's owner?

Just imagine if Israel did something real bad and America withdrew it's essential life support machine to Israel, can Israel be trusted enough not to nuke America/assassinate the American president just to get their life support back?

 
As I've said, the US securing it's own intersts, not in a Facist Imperialist way, but through normal international subterfuge. And yes, I know about the 9/11 hijackers, but they were trained, harboured and endorsed by the Afghan Taliban.
 

But they were indoctrinated in SAUDI ARABIA which sponsors so many terrorist activities secretly and the Americans are aware of this so why don't they invade?

If you are suffering from an illness, do you treat the symptoms or the cause of the illness?

 
It should be.
 

What happened to "live and let live"?

 
And once again, shock horror, the US funded people who wanted to hurt those they also wanted to hurt? Madness. Pure madness. Actually they didn;t fund AQ, they funded the Mujahadeen, and they are not anti-imperialists, they are religious fundamentalists that see their land as their Islamic right. Who see everyone else as a dirty kuffar that needs to be done away with.
 

The Mujahideen went on to form the Al Qaeda and Taliban groups. Essentially, we could say that what they are doing is what they did to the Russians, keeping their sovereignty.

 
When have I ever said that I believe that?   Of course I don;t, it would never have been feasible.
 

But doesn't that defeat the objective of the "war on terror" or is that a false flag operation?

 
Why would there be war? Have your little Caphilate so long as it doesn't try to expand, but then of course, at some point Islamic interests will come into conflict with the rest of the world, then there might be war.
 

Or could Western interests may conflict the interests of the Islamic Caliphate?

The phrasing of the question/statement is always important.  

 
Are they though? You make such a broad statement, have you any proof of such a claim? The Western world is the most advanced at the moment, based on a summation of all factors considered. Yes, other parts of the world have been more advanced at times, and generally, the regoin with the most advancement has the best things. I don;t see what that has to do with anything.
 

Well, the Chinese and the Indians are really going at it. Add the fact that China may pip America in terms of economy at the top in the next few years and as you have reminded me time and time again, capitalism is the driving force behind human advancement/progression.

 
Oh yes you did, do you want me to find your original post?
 

[/QUOTE]

Please do if you think it'll help.  

But I don't think you'll do that. You highlight the negative individual aspects of Islam rather than viewing it as a whole whilst I am guilty of of the same. I pick holes in your capitalist ideology rather then view it as a tool for human progression and advancement, in one form or another.

We need to stop Islamic terrorism by going to their houses and stealing their oil

Om nom nom, tasty oil. I can't wait till we invade another moslem country
 
 
T-ros you have a very inspiring view on the world  

Not being sarcastic at all.
 
 
Hmmm...

I think the only way to get rid of terrorism, in general, is to get rid of Bush and Blair and the CIA. They are the biggest terrorists ever and chose to go into countries and kill innocent people just so their ****ty political polices could be implemented. When they were both in power it was like a global massacre.

WHERE'S THE JUSTIFICATION IN THAT?!

The concept of terrorism/terrorists only seems to have become worldly recognised when Bush and Blair were in power. Not forgetting that they themselves are the biggest terrorists around. They did nothing but generate more hate around the world. As a result, the impact of terrorism became dramatically worse.

Whoever started this thread actually must realise that there isn't just "Islamic terrorism" around but other types as well forming from other types of religions etc. I'm assuming that you only think theres Islamic terrorism around because of what the media has shown you. Do not forget, the media is a manipulative and brainwashing tool.

Islam and the word terrorism should not even be related together.

Despite what the media might portray of Islam and the people belonging to that religion, Islam is a beautiful religion. To those that may disagree with me here, do your research and find out yourself. Don't believe what the media tells you and those of ignorant mouths.

All religions are beautiful despite what your beliefs may be

You are very ill informed if you think Presidents and Prime Ministers are terrorists when Al Qaeda, Haqqanis and Pakistanis are the real terrorists.

Now the question is, do YOU now realise that the Quran is just waiting for Science to fill in the blanks?  

 

But when you're specifically talking about the pips, you don;t refer to the whole apple everytime you refer to the pips  

Oh, well I'll be very interested to know where you're getting your story about the BAttle of the Trench and the Banu Qurazya from. Also, rather convienient once again, that a Hadith that was undesirable has been deemed not applicable for rather tawdry and obscure reasons. But hey, I'm sure that wasn't intentional  

Except there was no treason because what actually happened was they stayed completley nuetral, instead of helping Mohammed  

Well you;ve provided no evidence for your point of view, and then swept mine aside on the same basis yours can be swept aside, and yet you maintain yours to be true with no supporting evidence. What am I supposed to conclude?  

Not at all. Certinaly not if it contains multitudes of contradictions, scientific inaccuracies and morally ambigious judgements.

And did you miss the part where it says bone is clothed with flesh? That there is a 'clot' as a stage of pregnancy? This has been debated many times. The conclusion is that the description of birth is in no way supernaturally known, rather observations from various stages of pregnancy and misscarriage, with explains why there are such bhuge innaccuracies in the description. Oh and really? Hnaging = seperation? I'm sorry, but that's just a total fail of a point.

 
Do you think that it will remain status quo or will these &quot;oppressed nations&quot; start to revolt?

And how will they revolt? Revolt against the Western world and the status quo? They cannot, if they wish to become a first world country they have to work with us, any revolt will send them in the opposite direction.

Working with America doesn;t nessecitate being a genocidal dictator. You are implying there are only ever two clear sets of actions, which is fallicious. Totally so. The fact is a great many nations manage to cooperate with the West without turning into dictatorships. A great many go against the West whilst being dictatorships.

Actually statistically untrue. The majority of Iraqi's are glad Saddam was ousted. Congo has a government, fighting internal rebels. It's nothing like the same situation politically as a genocidal dictator  

Yes, yes they can. You see the Israelis and Israel, despite being rather unsavoury, understand what can and cannot be done in order to stay united with the Western world. They also know that on their own they are nothing. The same cannot be said for Islamic, Middle Eastern regimes, or Middle Eastern dictatorships.

It's not that simple though. Saudi have a far greater army than Iraq. They also have a far greater economic impact on the Western world, this far before we get to anything to with oil. Which isy'know, essential to us. Add to that political influence that Saudi weilds over the area, that they are essentially the enforcers of the Middle East. Yes, rather different. People like you really bug me. You arrogantly assume it's as simple as this country or that country, making no distinction between their hugely different attributes.

It doesn't apply to backwards barbaric regimes that infringe the human rights of huge portions of humanity I'm afraid.

They did, but they were not AQ when they were funded. Exactly, there is a difference between anti-Imperialism and dogma based Islamo-nationalism.

Not in the slightest.

Well bearing in mind the Islamic Caphiliate would be the new kid on the block, they would interfere with Western interests  

Oh please, India and China are nowhere near the West. The majority of both of their populations live in utter poverty, the whole Chinese economy is in a bubble and based on artificially keeping their currency low whilst exploiting their own workers. China isn't just going to come to a stop soon, the whole mechanism will explode.

  I view Islam as a problem, but I don;t balme any specific problem on it that really doesn;t rest with it. ANd yes I focus on the negative aspects of Islam when talking about the negative aspects of Islam. You said the whole of Capatalism was flawed, that Capatalism 'caused' the problems of today, and then went on to recant and resay until what you are saying now, which is that some aspects of Capatalism aren't so good.
 
 
Tbh everyone should just sit down, smoke some shisha, and chill the **** out.
 
 
The thread starter is an ignoramus. To utter/write such moronic phrases as "Islamic" terrorismi in itself displays the level of ignorance of the said poster.
