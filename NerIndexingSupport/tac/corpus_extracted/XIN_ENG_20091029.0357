The Communist Party of China (CPC) on Thursday published a selection of
regulations issued by the CPC from 2001 to 2007 to promote party building.

The selection, compiled by the General Office and Organization Department of the
CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection
includes 109 regulations currently in effect within the CPC.

Publishing those Party regulations could guide Party members to abide by the
regulations, and would be conducive to making Party affairs public, and
promoting intra-Party democracy, said a statement from the CPC General Office.

It would also help the masses and non-Party members to learn about the CPC's
efforts in party building, thus "enhancing the Party's cohesion and
combativeness," the statement said.
