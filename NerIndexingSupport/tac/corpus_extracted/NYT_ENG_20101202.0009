TAMPA  At one point early Wednesday night, USF led Virginia
Commonwealth by 18. But to Stan Heath's dismay, the Bulls had to
make it interesting, going to overtime with the Rams and prevailing
only after a last-second shot hit the rim and bounced out.

"We had opportunities to maybe make it a little easier on my
heart, but we just decided not to," Heath said after the Bulls'
60-59 win before 2,921 at the Sun Dome. "I've got to talk to my
team about that."

The Bulls (5-3) jumped out to a 28-10 lead and led the entire
way until VCU (4-2) scored five in 10 seconds for its first lead
with 40 seconds left in regulation. USF guard Jawanza Poland hit a
three-point play to give the Bulls a 52-50 lead, but Lakewood's Ed
Nixon hit a layup with 11 seconds left to force overtime.

Forward Ron Anderson, who finished with 10 points, 13 rebounds
and four blocks, led USF to a six-point lead in overtime, but again
it was just enough to hold on.

Up by four, USF's Augustus Gilchrist was called for an
intentional offensive foul with 1:13 left, part of a mandate to
issue the harsher call on any foul where an elbow strikes an
opponent's head. VCU's Jamie Skeen hit 3 of 4 free throws to pull
within one, and the Rams got the ball back for one last shot with
9.5 seconds left. Bradford Burgess (15 points, 13 rebounds) drove
and got off a shot but missed it short .

It was a close one, five days after losing in double overtime to
then-No.??23 BYU and four days after pulling out a three-point win
against Texas Tech. Six of USF's eight games have been decided by
seven points or fewer, and the nonconference nail-biters should
help the Bulls prepare for the pressure of Big East play.

"We know that every game in the Big East is going to go down to
the wire," Anderson said. "I'm glad we're going through this kind
of adversity now, because it's going to do nothing but help us once
we're in the Big East."

The Bulls had good balance , with forward Hugh Robertson leading
with a season-high 14 points, Gilchrist adding 12 and Poland 11.
USF had 14 assists on its first 17 baskets, benefitting from the
return of point guard Anthony Crater, who missed three games with
an ankle injury. Heath was pleased to see his team commit only 13
turnovers against a tough pressing team.

"We've been atrocious with turnovers and we finally did a good
job," he said . "Thirteen in any game's a good job. Thirteen
against this team is almost like having five in a regular game."
