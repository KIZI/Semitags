Nearly 70 percent of recruits to Afghanistan's elite armed police force drop
out, the top US army officer in charge of training the new Afghan security
forces said Tuesday.

Lieutenant General William Caldwell said the 67-percent "attrition rate" in the
Afghan National Civil Order Police was "far too high" and revamping the way they
worked to avoid burn-out was one of his main priorities.

The Afghan National Civil Order Police makes up three percent of the national
police overall.

Following his speech to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank in
London on Tuesday, Caldwell told journalists at NATO headquarters in Brussels on
Wednesday the overall dropout rate in the police was 25 percent.

In London, Caldwell, the Commander of the NATO Training Mission and Combined
Security Transition Command in Afghanistan, said developing the police was the
biggest challenge his team faced.

The task involved with the police was "significantly greater" than for the
Afghan army, he said.

Many Afghans are deeply distrustful of the police which they accuse of being
riddled with corruption, but Caldwell blamed the fact that until recently so few
recruits received any training at all.

"How can you expect people to do a job you have never trained them to do?" he
asked.

He said he hoped the introduction of new working methods for police recruits to
allow them more leave after what was now "extremely intensive" training would
prevent so many dropping out.

He admitted that when he saw the unforgiving training and working schedule that
the police had faced before his appointment, he was not surprised so many were
failing to complete the course.

"If you did to my army what we are doing to them, you would break it too," he
said.

Caldwell's organisation has just 2,500 military staff and about 2,750 civilian
trainers, but his budget will be 20.8 billion dollars (15.3 billion euros) over
the next two years, with "99.9 percent" of funding coming from the United
States.
