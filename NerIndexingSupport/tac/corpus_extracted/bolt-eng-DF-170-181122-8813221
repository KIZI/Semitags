 
 
Jane Roe going to Supreme Court.....
 
 
I can't seem to find a good story about this,but I saw "Jane Roe" on Hannity and Colmes last night with her lawyer. She says she is having a press conference today to announce that they are going back to the Supreme Court to ask for R v Wade to be overturned. It was a big deal on Hannity and Colmes and is the only place she announced it until the press conference today. I know it won't happen,but it seems she may have a darn good argument. I have seen her on t.v. before saying she never fully understood what she was doing when she went through all this. If anyone has a good link-go for it!! I have looked on different news websites,but can't find much.

On a side note,I also saw Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter on O'Reilly last night. She is pro life as well. She had an interesting story to tell. SHe had an abortion years ago and was dealing with a lot of pain. She also said she would overturn R v Wade.
 
 
I dated a girl years ago that put her baby (not mine) up for adoption, and she was dealing with a lot of pain also.

My sister went through an abortion as a Teenager. Later in life she was raped and got pregnant. Because of the guilt she felt from the first abortion she would not get another and gave birth to a wonderful young man that is currently my Nephew. She too would overturn Roe V Wade.
 
 
The problem I would have here, is overturning Law based on feelings..
Isn't that what the liberals practice, law based on "feelings"?

I agree with you, and to be honest, I do not feel that there is any basis to overturn Roe V. Wade, even though I am pro-choice-but with major stipulations.

RoeV.Wade is a ruling that said what happens between a woman and her doctor is a private matter and not the business of outside sources. Well, I, for one, still agree with this.

We can make abortions safer and rarer by creating laws to regulate RoeV.Wade more effectively...but taking away my right to be able to speak about personal matters with my doctor privately isn't the right way to do it.

As far as feelings are concerned...isn't the abortion debate almost entirely about feelings?

One person feels its a baby, another person feels its tissue that belongs to the woman carrying it.

If we were actually looking at FACT...pro-choicers would have to deal with the fact that in order to convince SCIENCE that the "tissue/fetus" a woman is carrying is "her body" and she can "do with it what she wants" and she will have to explain
- having two entirely different types of DNA in her body
- having two entirely different bloodtypes in her body
- occassionally having two entirely differnt sets of functional sexual organs in her body while not considering herself a transsexual

The bottom line is that science knows its another person. The pro-choice movement has had to lie about that in order to further their agenda...and more and more people, because of scientific developements like 3d ultrasound or because of negative experiences like a previous abortion...are starting to realize that it IS another person, or at the very least the start of another person...

Now...whether or not that other person has the same right to life as its mother is where the debate SHOULD begin.

Jane Roe was used by the pro-abortion nags back in the early 70's. She was their poster child for abortion rights, claiming she was raped and so on. She was never really raped although she kept up the charade for the sake of the Supreme Court ruling. To this day she marches at all the pro-life marches in Washington, and goes to church everyday to pray for forgiveness for what she helped to make happen. I giver her a lot of credit...........The big annual Pro-Life march will be happening on the 21st of this month as this is the anniversary of the ruling, so I would guess that's why the timing on this now.
 
 
I just caught something I put in my thread that was wrong. It was Martin Luther King's niece,not daughter on O'Reilly last night.

I think it is a morality issue as well as a legal one. We all have feelings as far as laws go. Our laws seem to be based loosely on the ten commandments,therefore they are based on morality. Not directly,but the basics...don't kill,don't steel,don't commit adultery. For me,abortion isn't natural,not supposed to happen unless a woman's body rejects a baby.

I don't think this will be overturned,but the vioce against abortion seems to be getting louder. I didn't know that so many women were commiting suicide after having an abortion until recently. Not to mention depression and a never ending feeling of guilt. I have to admire "Jane Roe" for having the guts to do this.
 
 
I think we as a society need to think what the real implications of abortion really are namely that it is the taking of a human life, although many wish to parse this into months, molecules, and the babies reaction to pain, whether it's actually a human or just a lump of tissue. Until we do that, abortion will go on unabated, and teenagers will kill their babies with baseball bats to the mothers stomach because hey it's not really a baby right?

We need as a society to decide that a human life is worth more than the doctor patient privacy relationship. And we need to ask oursleves why some are fervently against killing a known and convicted murderer, but without a moments pause would support killing a baby just because the baby is an inconvenience. There is nothing civil about that. It's not that outlawing abortion will in the short term stop abortion, it's that outlawing abortion means the law and society recognizes killing an unborn baby is not civilized, nor is it OKAY, nor is it right.

Until then all we can do is pray that people realize this on their own and think before they do it.

Where do you want to draw the line? An unfertilized egg has "different" DNA in it, as does each of the millions of sperm. Does that make the egg or sperm a baby? And the blood type is not necessarily different, and the sexual organs are not fully functional till puberty.

But lets step back a bit and address your first statement, "tissue or baby":

I was recently at BodyWorlds at the Science Center - plasticized dead humans, and of course, it includes some embryos as well.

At 4 week the embryo is smaller than a common FLY

At 8 weeks it's no bigger than my thumbnail.

At 3 months, it's about the size of a mouse, with a brain the size of a hazelnut.

It's not a human being - it's a potential human being. Carrying it full term will result in at least some health consequences for the mother - and it is certainly her choice if she wishes to bear this burden or not.

At 6 months it's the size of a rat, and this fetus is still not a human being, but a potential one. But at 6 months, the viability of the fetus becomes more clear. And at 6 months the mother has had plenty of opportunity to terminate the pregnancy.

From 6 months on, a termination can not be a casual decision.

Nevertheless, if a woman may die or suffer serious health consequences as a result of carrying the fetus full term, of if the fetus develops serious defects, then the woman still has the right to terminate, unless the fetus can be successfully delivered prematurely by cesarean.

While rare, these late term complications still must be dealt with, and that's the domain of doctor/patient discussion.

While a fetus is not yet a person, it is still human life. To debase a lifeform and deem it worthless because it hasn't reached its potential in intelligence and size is simply wrong. Too many living humans are not intelligent or large. When should it be legal to kill them?

Saying a lifeform has less right to existence because it is still developing or may be deformed is trying to justify action that is based on convenience not on scientific or logical data, life develops at different rates but is still life and humans give birth to human life. The more intelligent or large a lifeform the longer the development stage is, there is no logical reason to deny rights to a person still in development just because they are still in development.

A full set of DNA is needed for life, an unfertilized egg does not have a full set and is not yet alive therefore it is tissue.

Calling it an embryo doesn't change the fact that it is a human embryo and therefore human life at a different stage of development. Saying fetus still doesn't change the fact that it is a human life at a different stage of development. Calling it an infant is still another stage of the same life, there are others. Embryo, Fetus, Infant, Toddler, Childhood, Pre-Teen, Teenager, Adult. Denying rights because of where someone exists is beyond logic to me and the right to life is the most important of rights.

Therefore abortion should be performed only in an instance where the life of the mother is in jeopardy, self-defense is a right to life issue.

I propose a new area of science be developed where reproductive rights and the right to life are not in direct conflict. Remove the fetus with the full intent of attempting to keep it alive. At the beginning we will be largely unsuccessful, but as the science progresses these lives will be able to live to their potential without being the inconvenience people who want abortions want to avoid. It will have the added benefit of creating a way to have children with the choice of pregnancy so that women can have all the advantages of men without having to leave the workforce etc when having children.

I have a hard time seeing how a Buddhist could deny the existence of a lifeform because it is in the uterus rather than in the air and in development rather than fully developed.

Civil,you sound as if you think pregnancy is something that is a serious health risk to the mother. You talk about health consequences to the mother if she carries full term. That's silly. While things can always go wrong,a woman knows that when she gets pregnant. There are health consequences for everything we do. Being overweight,too much stress,drinking,smoking. These are all conscious choices.
I agree with no1 that you can't put the worthiness of a life on how big that life is or how far developed he or she is. Life begins at moment of conception-period.
 
 
 
... Life begins at moment of conception-period.

 

Not trying to be smart ass here Krisy..But do you have a scientific link
that proves that statement? In the context of 'life' of course, not just living.

Ok--I'm the father---I want this child---are you saying that I cannot make the decision to allow it to continue to develop ?

Isn't that kind of like asking for a link to a statement like, there are clouds? At the point of conception is when human development begins, or in the case of a chicken where that chicken's development begins ergo the beginning of life.
 
 
 
Married to the mother? Or just the father?

 

either one.
 
 
 
Not trying to be smart ass here Krisy..But do you have a scientific link

No link,just my belief. But if it doesn't start there,then when does it start? Life has a beginning, middle and end. I don't see how it doesn't start at conception. My belief is based a lot on my morals and religeous beliefs,I won't hide that. But, as I said earlier,our whole society is whether people believe it or not. The laws of our great country are based around the ten commandments,which brings us back to morality.

A scientific link will not change my mind or probably anyone else's. I believe God meant for life to begin at conception-it has to start somewhere. Keep in mind,abortion wasn't legal at some point,so at some point,it was considered wrong. It was not legal until the pro choice crowd took a young girl and tricked her into doing something she didn't fully understand.

Don't get me wrong,I'm not saying that you don't have morals if you believe in abortion,just that yours and mine don't click.

No, not at all..she stated...
 
Life begins at moment of conception-period.

 

I take that as a factual statement on her part..So, I'd just like to see the factual proof.

 
There are clouds.

 

Is a statement that can be proven.
 
 
 
No, not at all..she stated...
I take that as a factual statement on her part..So, I'd just like to see the factual proof.
Is a statement that can be proven.

 

a fact that also an be proven is that this "thing" was created from the cells from a man and a woman. I think maybe we can all agree on that. Why is it that only the woman has a choice in this matter ??
 
 
 
No link,just my belief....

 

Okay...maybe you may want to phrase it that way.."My belief is".

 
Don't get me wrong,I'm not saying that you don't have morals if you believe in abortion,just that yours and mine don't click.

 

Why does everyone make the assumption that if you ask a question of a Pro-Life person you are Pro-Abortion?
 
 
 
No, not at all..she stated...
I take that as a factual statement on her part..So, I'd just like to see the factual proof.

My point is, where else would life begin? Simply a question. I explained why I thought it was as obvious as the clouds. But if necessary I will attempt to find a link.

This is another problem I have with abortion....the father has no say. Why don't father's have rights as well? He is fully expected to take care of the child when he or she is born. It's simply not fair or right.
 
 
 
either one.

 

So then, what your saying is...Since you had a one night stand and she got pregnant, and do to complications she may die, You as THE FATHER have the choice of her or the fetus living, but she doesn't?
 
 
 
Okay...maybe you may want to phrase it that way.."My belief is".

Why does everyone make the assumption that if you ask a question of a Pro-Life person you are Pro-Abortion?

 

Mr. P, I got from an earlier post of yours that you weren't necessarily pro choice,but maybe didn't believe that Roe V Wade should be overturned. When I said that maybe your and my morals just don't click,I meant more generally. Anyone that is pro choice.
 
 
 
So then, what your saying is...Since you had a one night stand and she got pregnant, and do to complications she may die, You as THE FATHER have the choice of her or the fetus living, but she doesn't?

 

Good point,and that issue needs to be dealt with somehow( I really don't know ). But,I have a funny feeling that most abortions are done simply because the mother just doesn't want the child. We won't know for sure because a woman can walk in and say anything ot nothing at all. She doesn't need an excuse to have one.
 
 
 
My point is, where else would life begin? Simply a question. I explained why I thought it was as obvious as the clouds. But if necessary I will attempt to find a link.

 

First note..I asked for a differentiation between 'Life' and 'Living'.
 
 
 
So then, what your saying is...Since you had a one night stand and she got pregnant, and do to complications she may die, You as THE FATHER have the choice of her or the fetus living, but she doesn't?

 

whoa dude----you went straight to the extreme here. Let's try the moderate aspects of my posit first.
 
 
 
First note..I asked for a differentiation between 'Life' and 'Living'.

 

My assertion is there would be none. Therefore no existing scientific link that would define a difference in those. One, life, is provable the other is a state of mind, living, and not provable but based in opinion. The original statement is life begins at conception and I would reassert that with the above statements.
 
 
 
whoa dude----you went straight to the extreme here. Let's try the moderate aspects of my posit first.

 

Whoa? No..the anti-folks are always dealing in extremes..Fair is fair.
If one is anti-abortion, then one is anti-abortion...If there are exceptions, well
then they may be more Pro-Choice.

np I'll take it from there----first of all if the mothers own life is in REAL danger the the choice should be hers alone----If not, the father should have an opportunity to keep his child--married or not.

If we assert that Abortion is a choice of the mother, in order to make it logically equal it would be her choice whether to carry the baby or not but it should be the father's choice whether to support it or not as well.

If the father can be forced to pay for the baby even though he wished for it to be aborted, then the mother should not have the right to end a pregnancy if the father should wish to care for the child. Since the Mother does have a legal right to the choice of carrying the child, and she can force the Father to pay regardless of his feelings about the child all of the "rights" in those cases are lopsided and against males on a whole.

agreed---logically equal must be an oxymoron I guess  

face it---pro-choicers simply want women to be in total charge of reproduction.

That's true. I just can't imagine being a father and wanting and loving a growing child and having the mother abort that child for no reason other than the child is not convenient. I'm wondering dillo,how were things before abortion was legal? I was born in 1973. I have never thought to ask my parents for some reason. Mom was born in 51 and dad in 46. What I mean is,I guess if you got prego than that's just the way it was? You dealt with it and gave the baby up for adoption?

Often abortions were performed illegally. Those that didn't get abortions would often "go on vacation" for about 9 months and come back with no child, they were usually given up for adoption.

There were many deaths due to no Anti-bacterial drugs such as Penecillin. Even the back-door abortions done in doctor's offices were often fraught with peril for the woman. When Penecillin became a reality and regularly used this process was made more safe for women, even the illegal ones, and about six years later abortion became legal due to Roe v. Wade and the argument became moot.

100% with you on this!!!! It is extremely unfair that fathers married to moms, or not, get no say in the baby they are 50% responsible for creating.............

But intellectually you and I both know why this is done the way it is!!

I think a few went to Cuba in the 60's? But you are right, back then people did cope rightly or wrongly... at least the baby stood a chance of living and being loved by adoptive parents. No chance now, and no say now either!

I guess I knew the good part of the answer on that one. My mom's mom was 16 years old and pregnant in 1950. Can you imagine?!!! She was taken out of school,I know that much. Dad was in the service. My momwas given up at 2 weeks or days for adoption and the 2 best people in the world adopted her. I couldn't have had better grandparents.

Yeah, my father was adopted as well.

In case you don't know, The Alan Guttmacher Institute is part of Planned Parenthood, a Pro-Choice organization...

So a Pro-Choice Organization states that about 90% of abortions performed in the United States happen for reasons that have NOTHING TO DO with health of the mother or baby, or rape/incest.

So perhaps we should be talking about THESE abortions; rather than concentrating on the small number of abortions that most people would agree, have medical merit and could still be legal without legalizing abortions of convinience.

Thanks for posting, interesting to see the numbers. Scary though,some of the reasons.
 
 
 
In case you don't know, The Alan Guttmacher Institute is part of Planned Parenthood, a Pro-Choice organization...

Scary statistics, and scarier still that Planned Parenthood boldly broadcasts the numbers feeling no shame at all the unwarranted baby murders occurring. Pretty much says what they're all about!!

Look at their site sometime and see if you can find one thing bad about abortions written there.

There is a statement about how it is a good experience in most cases but nothing directly bad about abortion. They ignore psychological problems and other issues as well. It is clear what they stand for by an actual deep look into the site.
 
 
Planned Parenthood was the one who sponsored the, "I HAD AN ABORTION" T-Shirts...I think they epitomize the Pro-ABORTION vs. Pro-Choice movement.

Truly IMO it is clear that organization is exploitive of women, abortion is a huge money making horror, they use much of their money to get pro-choice candidates elected and re-elected, and so the cycle rolls on. Remember how Al Gore was originally staunchly pro-life until he discovered who holds the election purse strings? If they truly cared for the health of women, they would have waited for more studies to be done on the Ru486 abortion pill they were responsible for getting on the shelves in this country... that the FDA has now said needs further study as it has had deadly effects on some that have taken it, from severe abdominal bleeding, to death.
 
 
Bonnie...would you support Ru486?
Just wondering, I saw you mention it.
 
 
 
Wants to postpone childbearing: 25.5%
Wants no (more) children: 7.9%
Cannot afford a baby: 21.3%
Having a child will disrupt education or job: 10.8%
Has relationship problem or partner does not want pregnancy: 14.1%
Too young; parent(s) or other(s) object to pregnancy: 12.2%
Risk to maternal health: 2.8%
Risk to fetal health: 3.3%
Other: 2.1%

 

All of those reasons are valid in the first 3 months, without question. A tiny insignificant embryo is so far removed from "Personhood" it has no rights greater than any right of the mother.

(It's useful to note that 80% of abortions are performed before 10 weeks. At this point the embryo is barely the size of my thumb.)

After 6 months however only the serious health issues can be a condition for termination, and such late term terminations are indeed rarely performed, and then for these serious health reasons.

You know that is a great question, and one that I have struggled with.....The conclusion I have come to is for me personally I can not support it for two reasons, I don't believe it is safe, and if I am to be consistent with my faith teachings that life begins at conception, I can only support it if the mothers life is in danger and she would not be able to carry a child to term, then I think it's a better alternative than waiting a few weeks then performing a an actual abortion.

I have a good friend that took it a few years back, and she went through incredible pain physically due to internal bleeding, and hemmorages in her ovaries. When she recovered from that down the road she started getting horrible migraines which her doctor associated with the bleeding as she became horribly anemic. It took her a full 6 months to feel "normal again".

Emotionally she has been depressed on and off ever since, (she says) due to guilt over what she had done........

If it is going to be available it should be at the very least tested and refined.

But are you a doctor? The drug's safety is a matter for the board of doctors in the FDA to determine. Is it safer than a surgical abortion? Does RU486 have other legitimate uses? It is in fact almost as costly to use RU486 (and requires more visits) as a C&C, but that's not to say it's without benefits.

As far as your friend - such a story is anecdotal, and should not be construed as overriding factual evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of RU486 - only an objective double blind clinical study can determine that for certain.

The FDA has found RU486 safe, and this was after it had been in use in
Europe and Asia for over 12 years, a substantial track record of safety and efficacy.

One's personal belief relating to abortion in general is a separate issue from the merits of any particular course of treatment.

That's true. I just can't imagine being a father and wanting and loving a growing child and having the mother abort that child for no reason other than the child is not convenient. I'm wondering dillo,how were things before abortion was legal? I was born in 1973. I have never thought to ask my parents for some reason. Mom was born in 51 and dad in 46. What I mean is,I guess if you got prego than that's just the way it was? You dealt with it and gave the baby up for adoption?

 

Ouch--I'm as old as your Dad. You either kept it or had an illegal abortion

What in the hell does size have to do with anything here ??? Would you be willing to admit that this "size" argument is totally irrelative ?
 
 
Andy,

So you are using size, and physical development as a condition of personhood.

A baby's brain isn't fully developed, its eyes aren't functioning properly, its sexual organs, as you said earlier, won't be developed until puberty (although Kinsey would disagree), the babys bone's aren't fused together...hence the "soft spot." They don't have teeth, their organs are still coming forming completely....

And, of course, a newborn baby is MUCH SMALLER than a person (a distinction you seem very obsessed with)

While you will immediately dismiss this an outrageous analogy...it really has more in common with yours than you will care to admit.

A baby outside the womb, is a still developing human, many of its proper bodily functions will not be completely developed for years to come...a "fetus" is a human being at the most beginning stages of this development.

Both are stages in human development...both are HUMAN, just in different forms. Now, you can make an argument that it is appropriate to kill a human at that stage of development but not others...but to claim that it is somehow not human because it isn't developed enough yet is a lie...it is a human in it most beginning stages of development.

Whether you agree or disagree, Andy, the Pro-Choice movement is slowly losing steam...statistics show that more and more young women are pro-life or at the very least support abortion with heavy restrictions...WHY?

Most critics point to 3-D ultrasounds, showing just how HUMAN that fetus is and just how EARLY it starts to look human. They point to studies who show that the fetus feels pain at much earlier stages then ever before...they look to the increasing number of women who have HAD abortions who have come forward to talk about what a painful experience it was, and how ill-prepared they were for it emotionally, how the "abortion counselors" at the clinic were just that...people counselling them to have abortions, NOT people helping them make a CHOICE. They point to people starting to see the hypocrisy in a fetus being a baby when someone wants it...but being a blob of tissue when they don't.

For the Pro-Choice movement to survive it is going to have to deal with all of these issues...and one of them is going to be dealing with the fact that an abortion ends life...it doesn't scrape out tissue, it doesn't get rid of part of your body you don't like..it ends life.

Whether or not you want that to happen is another question entirely. But the fact is, it is a human being in its earliest stages of development...and that is where we should be starting the debate.

Using Mental development as the litmus test for viability is flawed, too. How many people have been brain dead - kept alive by machines only to recover, and lead healthy lives after?

We don't kill our adults because they can't survive w/o signifigant medical help - why isn't that same courtesy afforded to babies?

Well this has certainly been one of those threads.

Abortion is without a doubt a hot-button item on both sides of the issue. But everyone needs to face some basic facts.

We, as a society, are going to have to come to some agreement in regard to what is or is not acceptable regarding abortion. Some decision will have to be made - probably by a combination of government and courts. On the government end, we the people need to have our input heard and laws and policies will need to be adopted which reflect the will of the majority.

One thing to consider is that probably very few will be completely satisfied no matter what the ultimate outcome is. Those with strong religious or ethical convictions that life starts at the moment of conception will probably not have their view adopted and neither will those who believe that abortion on demand at any time is acceptable. As with anything else, there will have to be compromise, like it or not.

Whatever the ultimate outcome, those who believe that no abortion should ever be performed will have the satisfaction of still being able to apply their beliefs to themselves. Those who believe that abortion at any point is permissible will have to obey the law or leave the country.
 
 
Well said, Merlin. That's pretty much the situation as she stands. However, I'd like to raise again a question I have posed twice in this thread:

At what precise moment does human life begin? My question was not rhetorical - I really want to know if someone wants to go out on a limb and say, "Life begins at THIS point." You know what? I can't do it. No one can.

Some - like Krisy and myself, believe that life begins at conception. Others believe that life isn't life until the point of viability - independent of the mother. But, my point is, we just don't know.

Since we don't know - and since the stakes are as high as stakes get (life and death) - isn't it just prudent and sensible, not to mention decent and humane - to err on the side of life?
 
 
 
Fascinating. I would grant all living things the right to life without regard to personhood, but more especially human life.

 

When was the last time you swatted a fly, sprayed bug spray, set out a roach bait or a mouse trap?

When was the last time you ate a steak or a chicken or fish fillet?

When was the last time you ate a banana, or had a salad?

All living things. Certainly we revere human life as far as human beings above these - natural survival instinct - but there is a line that can be drawn. An embryo the size of a dime cannot be said to have rights that exceed the rights of the woman.

That really is the cruxt of the debate, and it is there that you will never get a satisfactory answer, especially from those who are pro-choice becasue it's easier for them to tell themselves life doesn't begin at conception making it more acceptable to do something wretchedly inhumane, and never be judged as wrong.

(I see no way to dispute the assertion that life begins at conception. That is a scientific fact - period. A better question would be when does that tissue mass become a human being. To me, a fertilized egg is not a human any more than a germinating acorn is an oak tree.

But I see your point in wanting to preserve potential human beings wherever possible. Like I said, this one is beyond me. Hopefully we can come to some decision on a national basis. Somehow I doubt that THAT discussion will be as rational as this one has been)

IMO, when 2 people make the choice to have sex, they should be very aware of the consequences. That includes the possibility of the woman getting pregnant. If you don't want a baby, the solution is simple. Don't have sex, or use protection. Everyone in my generation got the same sex-ed speil I got in high school. "Don't have sex or you might get pregnant". Did you think they were kidding when they said that? So why do all these teens and young adults keep having sex, get all suprised when they get pregnant, and go get abortions?

Here's the thing. Life begins at conception. Fact. If a mother decides to have an abortion, the child would have been able to live a full life without that abortion. Therefore it is wrong. The fact that many admit to killing these children because it is inconveniant frightens me. I cannot convey the level of contempt I feel for women who have consenual sex, get pregnant, and then abort the child because it would inconeniance them. You made the choice, live with it. Give it up for adoption. But killing the child for your own comfort is despicable.

Abortion should be allowed only when the mother's life is for sure in mortal danger. It is a horrible practice that does nothing but devalue human life.

Most assuredly the point that a fetus has rights will NOT be decided my measuring it. Put a hole the size of a dime in your aorta and have your Dr. tell me what happened to ya. ( lose the size argument--you're embarassing yourself)
 
 
 
Mr. P Wrote:

I agree with you, and to be honest, I do not feel that there is any basis to overturn Roe V. Wade, even though I am pro-choice-but with major stipulations.

RoeV.Wade is a ruling that said what happens between a woman and her doctor is a private matter and not the business of outside sources. Well, I, for one, still agree with this.

We can make abortions safer and rarer by creating laws to regulate RoeV.Wade more effectively...but taking away my right to be able to speak about personal matters with my doctor privately isn't the right way to do it.

As far as feelings are concerned...isn't the abortion debate almost entirely about feelings?

One person feels its a baby, another person feels its tissue that belongs to the woman carrying it.

If we were actually looking at FACT...pro-choicers would have to deal with the fact that in order to convince SCIENCE that the "tissue/fetus" a woman is carrying is "her body" and she can "do with it what she wants" and she will have to explain
- having two entirely different types of DNA in her body
- having two entirely different bloodtypes in her body
- occassionally having two entirely differnt sets of functional sexual organs in her body while not considering herself a transsexual

The bottom line is that science knows its another person. The pro-choice movement has had to lie about that in order to further their agenda...and more and more people, because of scientific developements like 3d ultrasound or because of negative experiences like a previous abortion...are starting to realize that it IS another person, or at the very least the start of another person...

Now...whether or not that other person has the same right to life as its mother is where the debate SHOULD begin.

 

As I have stated many times before, Roe v Wade did not make abortion legal, it took away the States' right to determine if abortion was legal. Abortion was legal in New York before Roe vs. Wade, for instance. Overturning Roe v Wade would simply give the States the right to determine whether or not to ban abortion. That is simply good jurisprudence, since the 10th Amendment states that the rights not specifically outlined in the Constitution are up to the States to grant or deny.

Furthermore, the 14th Amendment states that no person can have their life, liberty or property taken from them without due process of law. If you believe that the fetus is a person (as I do), then logically abortion is unconstitutional, since it denies the baby's right to life without due process of law.

As for what a woman does with her body argument. I agree, if she wants to get a tattoo, OK; if she wants to get liposuction, OK; if she wants an abortion --- not OK. Why? Because the body she's messing with isn't hers, it's her baby's! That argument simply is saying that the baby isn't a person (which is the same argument given in the Dred Scott decision, which stated that slaves were not people, but property). I can understand extenuating circumstances e.g. rape, incest, the life of the mother --- provided a court order is in place (hey--- "due process of law" should apply).

My opinion is that, if Roe vs. Wade were overturned, it would not change things much. The people of most states would vote to allow abortions, except in some of the more conservative states e.g. Utah and Louisianna. However, partial birth abortion would probably be banned in most states. Still, it should be up to the voters, not a panel of judges, to decide this matter. That is the right that the 10th Amendment gives us. Furthermore, it isn't the right of a bunch of judges to take that right from the voters. Period.
 
 
I absolutely agree - Roe vs. Wade is bad law, and it ought to go.
 
 
I personally don't have a problem with women having first trimester abortions for any reason, preferably as early as possible. A fetus that age clearly cannot survive outside the womb, and doesn't even have a heartbeat until week 5. I believe that if that right were restricted, an unfortunate number of self-mutilation injuries and deaths would occur from the old clotheshanger method.

Second trimester abortions, those after 13 weeks, begin to bother me. A fetus is definitely baby-shaped at least by that time, and I would imagine could feel pain. At 20 weeks, and perhaps slightly earlier, the fetus is often viable outside the womb, although it requires expensive life support to survive. I think abortions in the second trimester should be restricted to unusual situations involving the health of the mother.

If a woman is too unintelligent to realize she is pregnant by that time or to decide if she wants to have an abortion by that time, then she should bear the burden of carrying the fetus to term. Women in that category are likely to be on public assistance anyway, so missing work shouldn't be a problem.

If a woman is too unintelligent to realize she is pregnant by that time or to decide if she wants to have an abortion by that time, then she should bear the burden of carrying the fetus to term. Women in that category are likely to be on public assistance anyway, so missing work shouldn't be a problem.

 

Why should a human life be dependent on the intellect of the mother?
 
 
 
Why should a human life be dependent on the intellect of the mother?

 

That is putting it simply. I stated my opinion that abortion should be restricted to the first trimester, except in unusual cases. I don't consider intellect or absence of such to be one of the cases I would make an exception.

Then again, I'm not in charge, so it doesn't really matter.
 
 
 
Most assuredly the point that a fetus has rights will NOT be decided my measuring it. Put a hole the size of a dime in your aorta and have your Dr. tell me what happened to ya. ( lose the size argument--you're embarassing yourself)

 

That's a specious analogy. A hole in my aorta has absolutely no correlation with an embryo.

A little lump of flesh, the size of a dime, cannot be said to have "more rights" than the woman who is carrying it. The Supreme court has held that viability is the law, and a dime sized piece of flesh does not fall under "viability".

....since the 10th Amendment states that the rights not specifically outlined in the Constitution are up to the States to grant or deny.

Furthermore, the 14th Amendment states that no person can have their life, liberty or property taken from them without due process of law. If you believe that the fetus is a person (as I do), then logically abortion is unconstitutional, since it denies the baby's right to life without due process of law.
.

 

Interesting you bring up the 14th amendment, because:

1) The 14th amendment has been shown to REDUCE the effect of the 9th and 10th, reducing federalism by giving more power to the federal government and removing some from states.

2) The 14th amendment defines a person as one who "is born". therefore an unborn is NOT a person by definition.

A human the size of a dime would have the SAME rights as the other human. Size is not a requirement for rights that are given by the creator. Human life is not determined by size, nor are their rights. Saying because somebody is small or not yet intelligent certainly doesn't tell me that their rights should be suspended or superceded by the rights of another.

It doesn't define a person as that of being born, it defines a citizen as being born in the US. There is a HUGE difference. This amendment does not define "personhood" at all. The unborn person is not yet a Citizen, but no less a person by the definition in the 14th Amendment.

 
Section. 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

 

Now, defined as a person born here is a citizen the Amendment goes on to say that if you are in the jurisdiction you still have the same rights and does not define it by Citizenship. This is the same Amendment people site when getting welfare as an undocumented alien.

If we went by your definition anybody not born in the US would not be a "person" either.
 
 
Ya know.... it's really odd.....

A few weeks ago, libs were soiling their pants over supposed "torture" at Abu Ghraib prison. Many of the libs were going on and on how we should be extending rights and protections to those prisoners as if they were US citizens protected by the US Bill of Rights, even though we are under no obligation to do so.

Now we're talking about infants (who are not born) and all of the sudden, these concerns about who is a citizen and who isn't vanish into thin air!

Do a bunch of thugs and hoodlums really mean that much more to you libs than an infant? Seriously..... you split hairs in order to protect a woman's right to "chose" (i.e. commit infanticide) by arguing over the size of the fetus and yet are willing to extend the broadest protections to a bunch of thugs and murderers, many of whom probably make Charles Manson look like the Pope (oh yeah, bad analogy, to some libs, the Pope isn't much better than Charles Manson.... sorry).

Whose side are you on, anyway? Christ, guy, we're talking about a freaking kid that can't defend itself or speak for itself not an Islamoterrorist.
 
 
No, no. Perhaps Andy is on to something here. We should be allowed to kill non-citizens at our whim. I feel that terrorists are making MY LIFE and MY BODY uncomfortable...I should be able to kill them.

So by logical interpretation if a woman has a right to do with her body as she wishes then I can take my arm and stab anyone that pisses me off.............After all my arm is attached to my body is it not???? And if it's my desire then no one can tell me what to do with that arm YES???

Bonnie, I have to say that that is an absurd argument, and not even a reduct ad absurdum.

At question is at what point does fetus have rights that EXCEED the rights of the woman, not what you can do with your arm.

Now then, let's look at your argument. Can you take your arm and stab someone? because they "piss you off"? No. Because they threaten you with harm? Yes. Are they going to rob you of money? Yes, then stab them and run.

Under these circumstances, I'm sure you'll agree that you can use your arm to stab them. Under these circumstances, Your rights as a woman EXCEED the rights of this other person.

It's not if a fetus has "any" rights, it is at what point does a fetus have rights that exceed or overrule the rights of the woman.

A dime sized unviable embryo of insignificant development cannot be construed to have rights that exceed the rights of the woman in her health and life.

I don't believe that anybody says that the child's right EXCEEDS the right of the woman's. They just assert that they have the same rights to life as anybody else living. The right to privacy does not supercede the right to life and therefore the abortion could not be legal except in cases of self-defense.

And once again, embryo is just another stage of human development and most certainly is alive. Saying that they are not far enough developed is an opinion and certainly one not shared by everybody.

So we have shown that the 14th Amendment doesn't define a "person" as somebody born but defines citizenship as somebody that was born here. It is a geological definition. It also says that no person can be deprived of their rights that are in the jurisdiction of the US so even people that are not Citizens are afforded the same rights. This embryo or living human would have the same right to life as the mother. Therefore the mother's right to privacy could not supercede the right of the embryo to live. While the child will not be a Citizen until they are born they would still be a person as the Amendment does not define Personhood at all.

One argument in the toilet...(splish)

And you keep mentioning the size of the human life as if that made any difference. We have already shown that the right to life has nothing to do with the stage of development of their intelligence or of their size.

Argument two in the toilet.... (splash)

Simply stating this same absurdity over and over again doesn't give it a better status, it is still a lost argument.

Therefore an abortion in the self-defense of the woman would be right as it is self-defense, but an abortion for expediency would not.
 
 
 
Therefore the mother's right to privacy could not supercede the right of the embryo to live.

 

It's not just privacy. The mother's right to her health, life, and the quality thereof supercedes the right of an unconscious, unsentient, undeveloped, miniscule embryo.

I disagree. The right to life of any human supercedes the right of expediency in every case.

Often there are choices that you make in life that take from you each of those things. Quality of life is not a right, but life itself is.

And the health argument has already been ceded by me in earlier posts. If the life of the mother is in danger it is her right to protect her life.

The Supreme court ruled that VIABILITY is the restrictive terminology, and state may and do ban abortion at viability as allowed per Roe.

The Supreme Court outlined the factors that define viability in Roe.

As far as size - of course size is a factor, and it's useful in the parallels we can see for other life. Simply having human DNA is not enough to "demand rights". A cancerous tumor has human DNA. Does it have rights?

Health: When a woman carries a child full term, even if healthy, she will still have visible, physical and internal damage to her body. Carrying a child is hard on a woman's body. So hard that still today, 585,000 women die each year world wide in child birth.

Why should a woman be forced to take that chance if she does not want to?

Which is why I advocated removing the fetus from the womb with the aim of keeping it alive. Creating a new area of Medical Science that can at some point actually give reproductive freedom allowing women to choose whether to carry children or not as they decide while still having healthy babies after a term outside the womb. This would give an actual choice to women and allow for the rights of the developing human life as well. Over time we would be successful in keeping these children alive to live what may be productive lives rather than reducing them to the status of garbage.

Why is it that we advocate killing children in order to create this particular freedom?

Thus we are removing from human life the status of human, labelling it as fetus as if that were different than labelling another part of life as infant. Calling human life insignificant at any level is appalling to me.

Killing children should not be the goal, the goal should be actual choice and reproductive freedom rather than either kill it or keep it.

Only in the way that Infants are not children. Fetus is simply one label for a different stage of human life. I have explained this before. Zygote, Fetus, Infant, Toddler, Child, Pre-Teen, Teenager, Adult, Geriatric - All life forms go through these changes if development (except plants their stages are labelled differently). To say that somebody is less important because of what stage of life they are in I think is simply wrong.

I read an interesting article today in researching some of my responses here.

The premise is this:

Let me put the issue plainly. If the unborn is not a human being, no justification for abortion is necessary. However, if the unborn is a human being, no justification for abortion is adequate. Some say the unborn is not a human being. They contend it's just a non-viable tissue mass, merely a part of a woman's body. Others say it's only a "potential" human, or a human that is not yet a person. If any of these options turn out to be true, then it's hard to imagine how any additional considerations could make a difference. No further defense would be necessary. Have the abortion.

On the other hand, maybe the unborn child is a bona fide human being, deserving of the same care and protection you and I enjoy. If that's the case, then abortion takes the life of an innocent child simply because she's in the way and can't defend herself. This is not a reason to kill another human being.

From:
 http://www.str.org/free/solid_ground/SG9711.htm 

It's an interesting paper, and it really boils it down to the SINGLE issue at hand.

And here's my point: At the zygote and embryonic stages, that insignificant lump of cells is not a human being. It has the potential to become a human being, but it is not a human being.

The Supreme Court has gone farther than I, in saying that even the fetus is not a human being till viable.

Having said all that, if you believe that even the zygote is a human BEING, what are you religious beliefs and how do they affect you perception?

I am a Therevada Buddhist, they effect my opinion hugely but I have avoided that in this particular thread.

My religion would tell me that all life is important and there is no excuse for this regardless of "human" status other than to defend the life of the mother.

My religion doesn't effect the idea that I think human life begins at the Zygote and cannot see why the way it looks is even an issue. I have made my position clear, a stage of development for a human life does not make it so you can define it other than human life.

This is why we need strict constructionists on the bench. There has been too much interpretation of the Constitution (where the term interpretation can be defined as "distorting the meaning of the document to fit a particular agenda"). Roe vs. Wade was a bad piece of jurisprudence.... same thing goes for Lawrence vs. Texas. In both cases, rights were invented by the court. The court should not have heard either case, instead, deferring to the decisions of the states' courts. The right to have an abortion, the right to privacy are not specified in the Constitution, therefore, should be left to the States to grant or deny (btw..... if a woman has a right to an abortion, where does that leave me? I don't have a right to an abortion? I thought there was equal protection under the law! So I should be able to get an abortion, too. Oh, wait I can't get pregnant. OK.... tell you what, I should have the right to force my wife, girlfriend to have an abortion even to the point where I get a court to order it for me. After all, if I don't want to be a father and get saddled with the responsibility, or if I don't want to be burdened with child support, I should have the same right as the mother to abort my child. Case closed.... male abortions should be made legal immediately!)..... do you see how ludicrous this is?

absolutely!! And further the original litmus test for an abortion back when it was first legalized was that it was only to be in the event of harm to a womans well being healthwise, NOW that has come to encompass everything including the womans' lack of finances to mental anguish over telling her parents........Boo hoo On top of which many states now don't even need parents to give consent for their daughters to have abortions or even know about it.
 
 
 
Using Mental development as the litmus test for viability is flawed, too. How many people have been brain dead - kept alive by machines only to recover, and lead healthy lives after?

We don't kill our adults because they can't survive w/o signifigant medical help - why isn't that same courtesy afforded to babies?

 

...Americans use 'mental development' as a litmus test for just about everything actually. Just look up the average IQ of a high security prison. Or even better try the average IQ on death row.

Then look at the 'mental development' of the homeless for example. Then look at some other groups of adults that have been more or less thrown to the curb by American society.

So we actually do kill, or at least push people aside when they become too burdensome.

Just a thought.

The law says they aren't even allowed to vote before 18,but they can have an unbrn baby taken form their body?!!! No way. The fact the kid is even being examined by a doctor without a parents knowledge is wrong. I want to know anything and everything my kid is doing,especially at the doctor's office. Also,abortions can be dangerous,and a kid has no business making that decsion.
 
 
So you all seem to agree that teenagers have limited rights - not the same as adults or as one of you put "when they are of legal age" or something. So do Americans get more rights as they get older? If so, what rights do they start with and why? And who decides which rights they gain on which birthdays?

Working backwards:

21 - to drink
18 - to vote
16 - to drive

So then, one could argue that a fetus having not reached even its actual birthday has even fewer rights than teenagers. And you all seem quite comfortable with affording teenagers fewer rights.

I don't know what the laws are everywhere lses,but here a parent is responsible for a child/teen for a reason. They aren't capable of making the best decisions for themselves all of the time. A fetus is a lot different-not a good comparison. You have to give someone a chance to have those rights before they can have them. It isn't our place to take that away. Teenagers have proven over and over again,that they do not mkae the wisest of decisions for themselves. Obviously,as a person gets older,they mature and make better decisions.

Just the fact that they're having unprotected sex, and getting pregnant in the first place proves that...

They do have fewer rights but the right to life is one they DO have. Why take it away--give me one good reason other than incest or the health of the mother?
 
 
 
...Americans use 'mental development' as a litmus test for just about everything actually. Just look up the average IQ of a high security prison. Or even better try the average IQ on death row.

Then look at the 'mental development' of the homeless for example. Then look at some other groups of adults that have been more or less thrown to the curb by American society.

So we actually do kill, or at least push people aside when they become too burdensome.

Just a thought.

 

I'm not following the point you're trying to make.

Even if we go upon your premise here, I think that most people would agree that the "right" to be alive is probably the very first right a person has, therefore, the baby in the womb, the youngest form of human, still has the most basic right, the right to live.

Exactly.
 
 
Thinking on it some more...I would add that the things you have mentioned (driving, drinking) are not RIGHTS but privledges bestowed upon people when the law has decided they are mature enough to handle them...

I believe the line is, " Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness..." not, "Life, liberty, the right to drink a 40 with your friends in the basement of your best friends house on a Saturday night, a new car in the driveway when you turn 16, and the pursuit of happiness..."
 
 
 
When was the last time you swatted a fly, sprayed bug spray, set out a roach bait or a mouse trap?

 

I don't. Well I did set a mouse trap but it was the kind where the mouse lives and you return it to the wild.

 
When was the last time you ate a steak or a chicken or fish fillet?

 

Don't be disingenuous and resort to Reductive Fallacy you were doing so well until then.

I eat other living things often, but no matter what you eat you take life even vegetables were living before you ate them. It is part of the circle of life thing. What is needed is respecting the exchange and the life taken. I don't call it a bunch of cells in order to make myself feel better nor do I propose that it is okay to kill an animal at any juncture just because they may be in your way.

When was the last time you thought it was okay to kill a cow just for fun? The point is to avoid taking the life spontaneously for only your convenience. In this I would say it would be wrong to abort puppies, let alone human life.

 
When was the last time you ate a banana, or had a salad?

 

Already answered in the above statement. You don't take the life simply because you like to step on bananas you need to eat the banana and show respect for the life taken, do not waste the necessary exchange made in order to keep your life.

 
All living things. Certainly we revere human life as far as human beings above these - natural survival instinct - but there is a line that can be drawn. An embryo the size of a dime cannot be said to have rights that exceed the rights of the woman.

 

And once again, they do not exceed the rights of the woman they are EQUAL TO the rights of the woman. No matter how many times you say I said the right to life of the child EXCEEDS the right of the woman you know intellectually and in reality I have never said anything of the sort and in fact I have expressed the opposite and that when the woman's life is at stake she has the right to defend herself. At that point her right exceeds that of the child but until then the right to life is uppermost.

Except that it isn't. How to explain... the human never will lose the right to life it is the most fundamental right and if taken it removes every other right in perpetuity. To say that a fetus has less right than a mobile human is clear and easily shown, but to say that they do not have a right to life is simply taking that a step too far.

It's not a baby in the womb - it's either a Fetus, Embryo, or Zygote.

As a zygote it's nothing but a few undifferentiated cells. How do a few cells have a "right"?

Andy
 
 
 
What an unbelievably excellent point.

Yet, as Gem stated, the right to Life is the utmost right one has - the right that supercedes driving, voting, drinking, or even liberty itself. And, as acknowledged in our Declaration of Independence, it is unalienable, in other words, incapable of being repudiated or transferred to another. It is also given to us, not by the government, but by our Creator. So while progressive rights are a fine concept, it is a concept that applies only to those rights which stem from the government - like driving, voting, and drinking.

The same way those same cells have a right when they have developed into a Fetus, an Infant a Child, etc.

Development cannot be a standard of human life when it is clear that those cells will not develop into any other life. Therefore the zygote is at one stage of human life and deserves the most fundamental of rights, the right to live.

Okay, but I'll state the "progressive" life rights apply to a zygote, and embryo. As the BRAIN (the part of the human animal that really differentiates us from lower animals) develops, that is where we can draw the line at person hood.

A few undifferentiated cells with no brain stem? Not a human being.

But is still human life.

No matter how many times you tell me that they are undifferentiated cells it will not convince me that it isn't human life. Although those cells may be more than one human being (a zygote can separate into twins as late as 14 days after conception) they will never develop into any other living thing than human. This is clearly human life and at even the basest level deserves the most fundamental of all the rights, the right to live.
 
 
As I posted earlier, it comes down to one, fundamental, issue:

At what point do an egg and sperm become a human being?

At such a point PRIOR to becoming a human being, there is no moral issue or problem with pregnancy prevention or termination.

At such a point AFTER, the moral issues become very complex.

You *** WILL NEVER *** Convince me that a few undifferentiated cells of a zygote are a human being. Such a belief goes beyond reason and rationality.

At the far end of the spectrum then, we find people that wish to label these few undifferentiated cells a human being.

At the other end of the spectrum, are those that believe that a pregnancy can be terminated at any time (not to mention the far loony end that encompasses infanticide).

I consider both of these extremes irrational, their arguments without merit.

I do find myself in the middle ground, than middle ground being brain differentiation and development. It is the brain that separates the human from lower animals. It is the brain that makes us "human". Without a human brain, we are not human. Our consciousness and sentience resides in our brains, and we have no further to look that the cerebrum for determining the emergence of a human individual being.

Andy

Floccinaucinihilipilificator!

I determine that an opinion that sets human being status at some other point than conception an argument without merit, there is no common ground for us to stand on. This is the reason I put forward what I believe to be a reasonable alternative.

Just saying my argument is without merit doesn't make it so. Any more than my saying so made your argument without merit. It is simply an opinion and one which we will never meet on. I can live with that so long as people are willing to work towards a compromise that will conceivably work for both sides of the equation.
 
 
Civil,

What stage of brain development are you speaking to? Afterall, we know for a fact that a newborn babies brain is not as developed as the brain of a healthy person in their 20's...should we determine a person not fully developed until their brain is functioning at its height?

Or are you simply going upon when the brain first appears...or is it another size thing...once the baby's brain is the size of a dime we can't abort it...or a quarter?

What about when the brain starts deteriorating...when an old person's brain deteriorates to a low enough level can we kill them because they are no longer "human"?

Perhaps a sliding scale of personhood? The age in which a person's brainfunction is at its height will be the "ultimate person"...and then sliding outwards is the downward sloping scale towards childhood and oldage and "human-ness" can of course slope accordingly.

Zygote---Embyro---Fetus---Baby---Infant---Toddler---Child---Youth---Adolescent---Teen--- Young Adult ---Adult---Elder Adult---Senior---Elder
 
 
If civil has proposed that we can kiill people until their brains fully develop does that mean he believes that we can morally killed people who mental handicaps? This sounds like an argument the extreme feminists might make to slaughter all men.
 
 
 
Civil,

As as starting point I'm talking about the zygote, which has no brain and not even a brain stem.

No Brain = not a human being.

Let me start by saying thanks for the return comments from all of you.

About the "the right to life":

It is not guaranteed anywhere or implied to be guaranteed anywhere. The Declaration does not count. It is like saying a good halftime speech counts in the interpretation of U.S. law. It sounds great and defines a wonderful idea, but it does not define the LAW.

To return to Civils point about the Constitution: the framers agreed in the 14th amendment to give rights to people BORN here, not conceived here. So it is not saying that people not born here are not people (nice try), but they are not Americans and therefore not protected by the U.S. Constitution. So we start the rights when they are BORN (or are granted citizenship some other way, but it is ALWAYS after they are BORN) or at least that seems pretty clear.

OR who cares when life begins:

If I agree that life begins at conception I have some simple questions that must be addressed:

1) Is drinking while pregnant going to be against the law? It is illegal to drive while drunk, because it exposes fellow citizens to unnecessary risk. How about smoking? How about exposure to second-hand smoke?
2) If a mother-to-be does drink can the state charge her with manslaughter or murder if her she has a miscarriage? What if the mother-to-be does anything else negligent? There are many things that mothers-to-be should not do  which ones will be illegal?
3) Even worse what is a mother-to-be knowingly exposes the fetus to harm leading to death or physical defect? That clearly will be a crime, right? Maybe the ones that do not die can sue the mother (after she is released from prison) for pain and suffering caused by the negligent mother.

So where do we draw the line with what rights begin when?

I look forward to your replies.
 
 
I don't believe for a second that CivilLiberty is implying anything of the sort. I DO however, believe that CivilLiberty feels that his opinion on this subject is obvious and logical...and what I, and others, are trying to point out is that when it comes to this subject, people arriving to the same conclusion as he is isn't logical.

He was originally saying that something that small couldn't be human. Now he is saying that something without a developed brain (we don't know what HIS definition of appropriate brain development for life is) is not human.

What he is missing is that most ardently pro-life people are not saying that a one-month-old fetus is the same type of human as a 12-year-old child...but rather that it has the potential to reach that same status, and that it is quite actively working towards becoming that status...it isn't the woman's body, it is another body...growing, changing, and developing, more and more every second....and that because it would become a fully-functional human being if left alone killing it because it would be tough to have to wear maternity clothes for 9 months and then to give the child up for adoption would just be really embarrassing...is NOT a good enough reason to kill a living, growing "potential" human.

You are wrong, the Declaration is one of the documents from which the SCOTUS gets its precedent. In fact they are not even limited to the Documents set forward by the founders. Just recently a ruling was issued using International laws as a precedent which sparked the debate whereby some Legislators are thinking of Legislating that they will be limited to US law.

The 14th Amendment Grants CITIZENSHIP to people born here but acknowledges that the rights extend to every human that is within their jurisdiction regardless of citizenship status. This is the same Amendment that illegal aliens use to get the right to an education, welfare, healthcare, etc. It has been ruled that way by the lower courts and allowed to stand by the SCOTUS and therefore rights do apply to all people within the jurisdiction of the US without regard to citizenship status.

1) Drinking while pregnant is against the law and one can be charged with Child Endangerment and many have been. Shoot all you have to do is watch ER to know that.

2) Yes. It has been applied that way before. Once again a quick perusal of ER would get you a good picture of how it has been applied.

3) Yes again, it has been applied in that very way.

The fundamental Right to Life begins when human life begins.
 
 
No1toVoteFor,

Sorry, but I drinking (or smoking) while pregnant isn't against the law, its heavily discouraged. However, some doctors say that a glass of wine every few weeks is fine and if it makes you feel better during pregnancy than go for it.

Proving child endangerment when the child is unborn is still a very tricky matter in our legal system. Cases have gone both ways...

My point in this matter however, is that we are not talking about legal precedent...we are talking about the subject of abortion in general...

If we were simply talking legal precedent then the conversation would be over: abortion is legal. Case closed.

What we are discussing is whether or not the laws that we have in place today are correct, or whether they are in need of revision. To fall back to "well, its legal so it must be right." as a defense is silly and in a sense, diminishes the very legal system you are backing up...laws were meant to be studied, debated, and revised if neccessary...we have changed our forming documents to include ending slavery, allowing blacks and women the opportunity to vote, to outlaw and then re-legalize alcohol...change has happened within our legal history and will continue to do so.

Whether or not abortion laws should be among the changed and why is really what the debate is about...

Read through the entire site. However it has definitely been applied there. Alcohol fetal syndrome has been used as a reason to punish mothers as well.
 
 
quote from that site:

 
In two cases, women have been arrested for drinking while pregnant. In State v. Pfannestiel, Wyoming officials brought criminal charges against a pregnant woman for drinking on the grounds that her activity, while itself legal, constituted child abuse because it endangered her fetus. The charges were dismissed on the narrow legal grounds that the state could not prove harm from the alcohol to the fetus while it was still in utero.(8) In Missouri, Lisa Pindar was charged with second-degree assault and child endangerment after her son was born, allegedly with signs of fetal alcohol syndrome?(9) In addition, at least one judge has commented approvingly on such prosecutions.(10) Surveys of these prosecutions indicate that despite evidence that illegal drug use is the same across race and class lines, women of color, and poor women are the ones who are being prosecuted.(11) Of the cases in which the race of the woman could be identified, approximately 70% involve women of color.(12)

 
 
 
Another site complaining about it.

 
Criminal Prosecution

Although no state has enacted a law that specifically criminalizes conduct during pregnancy, prosecutors have used statutes prohibiting abuse or neglect of children to charge women for actions that potentially harm the fetus.6 Some have also argued that pregnant women "delivered" drugs to "minor" children - fetuses - through the umbilical cord.7 In addition, a mother's or newborn's positive drug test has led to charges of assault with a deadly weapon (cocaine), contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and possession of a controlled substance.8 In cases in which infants tested positive and died soon after birth, women have been charged with homicide or feticide.9 Some women have even been prosecuted for drinking alcohol10 or failing to follow a doctor's order to get bed rest or refrain from sexual intercourse during pregnancy.11

The laws do not specifically say that if you are pregnant that you are not allowed to drink, but they are prosecuted under child abuse and child endangerment laws.
 
 
Prosecutors clearly do not attempt to charge every mother-to-be that they could with endangerment, manslaughter or murder, currently. I hope that we agree about that.

There are way too many actions that a mother-to-be could engage in that could endanger the fetus. Many of these activities are NOT harmful to the mother. Where is the line? Well it seems to currently be drawn at birth, maybe purely for practical reasons. Should bartenders give pregnancy tests to every woman they serve. They would be partially responsible for the death of the fetus if the drink they served contributes to the miscarriage or deformation of the fetus. They are knowingly acting in a potentially reckless manner  any woman could be pregnant.

How does the law begin to deal miscarriages? They will ALL need to be autopsied. Any pregnant woman not getting basic healthcare will be negligent. If I am not mistaken about 1/3 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Sure it was not the intention of the mother-to-be to spontaneously abort, but people do not intend to kill people driving to work in the morning either. Both would have to be equally investigated and potentially prosecuted under this new system.

How would the law address U.S. citizens committing murder outside the U.S. and then returning U.S.? I know the U.S. does not prosecute people who smoke Cuban cigars while in Canada, but murder seems a little different.

How about this one:

A woman gets pregnant and has a miscarriage. Doctors tell the woman and her husband she will probably never be able to carry a pregnancy to term. She and her husband decide to try having a child again. Once again she has a miscarriage. Well if the right to life begins at conception and she and her husband knew the risk was she might murder the second fetus she and her husband have knowingly acted recklessly and caused a death. What should happen to them?

Now to the Constitution:

My point is not about what right the 14th amendment gives to people. It is about when. Nowhere, in any documents which anyone has mentioned, does any right start at conception. You are arguing you would like it to, but the words are not there, nor does the intention seem to be there. The framers consistently chose being born as the defining moment. Illegal aliens have already been born. Their fetuses are not citizens. If an illegal alien gives birth here, then POOF the child is a citizen. If the U.S. government sends them back across the border then the child is born, then POOF not a citizen. Citizens and non-citizens seem to all be BORN. That is clearly an important deciding moment that the framers were interested in using. I am okay with it. They were not interested in protecting the unborn when they wrote the Declaration or the Constitution. So maybe the rights do not begin until someone is born.

Doesnt the Constitution afford more than one right to people born in the U.S. and not to life conceived in the U.S.? The framers would have said conceived if they meant conceived, no?

Question to no1tovote4 about the Declaration:

I am not trying to put you on the spot, but you seem to know something about the law. I would be interested in seeing a case where the right to life from the Declaration was used as an argument and won, thereby setting the precedent.

This post is getting too long sorry.

Look forward to your ideas.

That is clearly an important deciding moment that the framers were interested in using. I am okay with it. They were not interested in protecting the unborn when they wrote the Declaration or the Constitution. So maybe the rights do not begin until someone is born.

Doesnt the Constitution afford more than one right to people born in the U.S. and not to life conceived in the U.S.? The framers would have said conceived if they meant conceived, no?

Question to no1tovote4 about the Declaration:

I am not trying to put you on the spot, but you seem to know something about the law. I would be interested in seeing a case where the right to life from the Declaration was used as an argument and won, thereby setting the precedent.

This post is getting too long sorry.

Look forward to your ideas.

 

"Doesnt the Constitution afford more than one right to people born in the U.S. and not to life conceived in the U.S.? The framers would have said conceived if they meant conceived, no?"

The Rights in the Constitution are afforded to every person within the Jurisdiction of the US but they are inalienable rights. This means that they are a right afforded to you by your existence.

I will get to the answers of your other questions later. I have to go home now.

This is definitely an interesting thread.
 
 
 
How would the law address U.S. citizens committing murder outside the U.S. and then returning U.S.? I know the U.S. does not prosecute people who smoke Cuban cigars while in Canada, but murder seems a little different.

 

That's easy. Outside of US "soil", the US has no jurisdiction. A person is only required to abide by the laws of a state or nation while within the jurisdiction of that state or nation. Conversely, just because you're a US citizen does not absolve you of the requirement to abide by the laws of whatever state or nation you are presently in.

But in Canada, cuban cigars are legal, murder is not. If you commit murder in Canada, then you are criminally liable in Canada under the laws of Canada.

The term "inalienable rights" is not in the constitution.

The constitution makes no statement of "rights of people born in the US" until the 14th amendment, which followed the civil war, decades after the framers were dead.

Keep in mind that at the birth of our nation, "rights" meant very different things to different classes of people. Slaves has virtually no rights, women had limited rights. These "inalienable" rights you mention were certainly alienated from slaves!

Also keep in mind that until the 14th, states could have laws endorsing a specific religion, or restricting speech, or other unpleasantries. Only the FEDERAL government (congress) was restrained by the Bill or Rights.

Inalienable rights is in the Declaration which is one of the documents by which the SCOTUS makes their decisions on Civil Rights.

Rights by definition are inalienable and not given by the Government, they are given by the fact of existence. Some Governments my infringe on those Rights but it is believed that they are your Rights regardless.

That is true right now. But if abortion were made illegal here, therefore murder, would the U.S. still be ok with it citizens commiting the murder somewhere else. Murder is a capital offense. It is not a Cuban cigar.

The prosecutor could say the U.S. citizen (fetus) was taken against its will to be killed in Canada. If someone is kidnapped here then murdered in Canada is not the offender accused of a capital crime here, because the kidnapping lead to murder. If the mother is suppose to act in the best interest of the fetus, taking it to Canada, where fetus murder, as it would be under U.S.law, is practiced as medicine, seems to be a direct action leading to the cause of the citizen fetus' death. Therefore the crime started here.

Look you may think this is really pushing it but to me clearly not beyond the scope of the possibility.

So to me it is not that easy.

The law of the land would apply. If in Canada it is okay to kill a fetus it would be legal for a person to travel there and do it. There is precedent for this. Many rich people travelled to foreign countries to kill their fetus when Abortion was illegal.

However Rights are still Rights and are not given by the Government. The Constitution was created to protect our Rights.

This is the reason for Amendment IX which states that rights not enumerated specifically in the Constitution are still Rights.

The Right to life is not specifically enumerated but is one of the Rights afforded to us by our existence.
 
 
 
Prosecutors clearly do not attempt to charge every mother-to-be that they could with endangerment, manslaughter or murder, currently. I hope that we agree about that.

 

Agreed, but there is precedent where mothers have been prosecuted for damage caused by drinking.

 
There are way too many actions that a mother-to-be could engage in that could endanger the fetus. Many of these activities are NOT harmful to the mother. Where is the line? Well it seems to currently be drawn at birth, maybe purely for practical reasons. Should bartenders give pregnancy tests to every woman they serve. They would be partially responsible for the death of the fetus if the drink they served contributes to the miscarriage or deformation of the fetus. They are knowingly acting in a potentially reckless manner  any woman could be pregnant.

 

Many of those can be and are prosecuted. Say if I get in an accident with your wife who spontaneously aborts I could be tried for 2nd Degree Murder. If a mother recklessly endangers the life within her it is conceivable that at some points and places she would be prosecuted as well.

 
How does the law begin to deal miscarriages? They will ALL need to be autopsied. Any pregnant woman not getting basic healthcare will be negligent. If I am not mistaken about 1/3 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Sure it was not the intention of the mother-to-be to spontaneously abort, but people do not intend to kill people driving to work in the morning either. Both would have to be equally investigated and potentially prosecuted under this new system.

 

I am unsure how this would be applied. My new system doesn't deal with spontaneous abortion, and would make it so the Mother would have an option to end a pregnancy without having the need to plan to kill the fetus.

 
How would the law address U.S. citizens committing murder outside the U.S. and then returning U.S.? I know the U.S. does not prosecute people who smoke Cuban cigars while in Canada, but murder seems a little different.

 

Unless there were laws against travelling specifically to Canada the Mother would break no law travelling there. While there she is subject to the law of Canada and therefore could legally abort her child.

 
How about this one:

A woman gets pregnant and has a miscarriage. Doctors tell the woman and her husband she will probably never be able to carry a pregnancy to term. She and her husband decide to try having a child again. Once again she has a miscarriage. Well if the right to life begins at conception and she and her husband knew the risk was she might murder the second fetus she and her husband have knowingly acted recklessly and caused a death. What should happen to them?

 

The probability of spontaneous abortion is not reason enough to convict somebody of 1st degree murder or even 2nd degree. Since it is only a probability there is a chance that what they hoped for would happen, the successful delivery of a fully developed infant. However if we develop the idea that I have she would have an option to have the child develop ex utero.

 
Now to the Constitution:

My point is not about what right the 14th amendment gives to people. It is about when. Nowhere, in any documents which anyone has mentioned, does any right start at conception. You are arguing you would like it to, but the words are not there, nor does the intention seem to be there. The framers consistently chose being born as the defining moment. Illegal aliens have already been born. Their fetuses are not citizens. If an illegal alien gives birth here, then POOF the child is a citizen. If the U.S. government sends them back across the border then the child is born, then POOF not a citizen. Citizens and non-citizens seem to all be BORN. That is clearly an important deciding moment that the framers were interested in using. I am okay with it. They were not interested in protecting the unborn when they wrote the Declaration or the Constitution. So maybe the rights do not begin until someone is born.

 

They clearly give the priveledge of Citizenship to those born here but never define the time that rights start. To simply say they didn't say unborn is disingenuous. They did not have the scientific knowledge that we have today.

 
Doesnt the Constitution afford more than one right to people born in the U.S. and not to life conceived in the U.S.? The framers would have said conceived if they meant conceived, no?

 

The Constitution cannot afford Rights to anybody it specifically enumerates several that we have but Rights are not given by the Government they are protected or infringed on by Governments. It specifies many priveledges of Citizenship which one must be born to get.

Interestingly enough, previous to a recent ruling

 http://www.cato.org/events/030402bf.html 

The Declaration was used often as a Legal Document. However Scalia doesn't see it that way.... It is only one opinion from one of the Judges but heck.

 
 
 
 
Why should the parents have to know? Doesn't a teenager have the same rights as every other American as protected under the Constitution? If not, when should those rights begin?

 

Schools, and government institutions do not have a right to circumvent parental authority until they are aged 18 in most states. Why do parents need to be called by the school nurse before administering so much as a Tylenol, but killing a baby is okay???

Read this article and notice the part where the woman says she doesn't want the parent consent law because it would have a huge impact on the abortion rate. As if that is a bad thing. So what,she wants as many as possible to scar teens for life? Jeeese!!!

I am saying the lawmakers make judgments as to which rights apply to which people. You just want different rules, but you still want rules.

And it is not a "baby" yet. Why is it okay to destroy human life? I do not know, but it seems to happen all the time. That is another topic.

Also your examples are poor.

1) Public schools and other government institutions are held to different standards - they are public, therefore their power is given to them by the citizens, in some sense. A child in a private school would be treated differently. Also school nurses are M.D.'s or D.O.'s. Seems different right there.

2) It is unreasonable to say doctors cannot ever perform medical procedures on minors. (You will argue that I should not be so all or nothing, or there are exceptions. Yes there are. And exactly which ones would you like to keep?) First doctors are private businesses, so public school rules do not apply. As a society we have agreed that doctors have certain power that other people do not have. That is why it is so difficult to practice medicine. Second, should a sexually abusive father be asked if his daughter can have an abortion? I know you will say there will have to exceptions, but how will you know who is lying and who is not. Please do not suggest asking the mother, because that is not going to work either. You probably cannot have a 6 week investigation and 6 months would be out of the question. Third doctors perform procedures on minors all the time without parental consent. You just like those procedures better.

Pro-lifers should stop fighting the law and just work towards a goal of living in a world where no one wants to get an abortion, because you cannot stop them from occurring as long as people want them, sorry.
 
 
PLEASE everyone answer this question:

A woman gets pregnant and has a miscarriage. Doctors tell the woman and her husband she will probably never be able to carry a pregnancy to term. She and her husband decide to try having a child again. Once again she has a miscarriage. Well if the right to life begins at conception and she and her husband knew the risk was she might murder the second fetus she and her husband have knowingly acted recklessly and caused a death. What should happen to them?

My response:

WHAT? I can give cars keys to a person who I know has epilepsy or schizophrenia. I can give a gun to a convicted felon. I can do a long list of things that MIGHT cause harm to some third party. If something goes wrong I would be in deep trouble though. I cannot not see any difference between my example with the miscarriage and the examples I just gave which would clearly make me partially responsible for the actions of the second party.

You cannot have it both ways. Abortion is either murder or it is not. None of the pro-lifers would complain if a prosecutor charged a rapist with murder if the rapist happens to rape a woman who was known previously not to be able to carry a child to term and she had another miscarriage.

Just like every other death caused by a second party (in my example the mother and father) intention or lack of it may only save you some prison time or spare you the needle. It very rarely gets you free pass.
 
 
All of my points revolve around the idea of making abortion illegal is completely impractical. Yes impractical, not right or wrong, or god says it is evil or whatever. It is just impossible. Did anyone ever think the Supreme Court knew this when they legalized it?

Another poster mentioned that "rich" people used to travel abroad to get them done before abortion was legal in the US. Well travel is cheaper and so is getting an abortion. People go to Canada to buy cheap drugs. If it becomes illegal again, what makes you think that abortion clinics will not be franchised along our borders and the companies traded on the NYSE?

I'll say some more tomorrow.

Thanks everyone.

The only rights we ACTUALLY have are the ones protected by the government. Not the ones we just THINK we have.

Also you assume everyone believes in creator given rights. Some people go with just the governemnt ones.

And you probably do not want to upset your creator, he/she probably likes to be capitalised - Creator.
 
 
 
My response:

Just as with any other pregnancy there is a chance of spontaneous abortion, we could not charge every parent that had one with a charge of Murder. In the course of human events some chances must be taken and this is one. What if she choose to cross a busy street, she has an increased chance of being hit by a moving truck, but it isn't murder if she is and there is a spontaneous abortion. It is the direct action of a human being killing another with forethought that we are trying to avoid, not choosing whether women can choose to get pregnant because of an increased chance of spontaneous abortion.

 
If something goes wrong I would be in deep trouble though. I cannot not see any difference between my example with the miscarriage and the examples I just gave which would clearly make me partially responsible for the actions of the second party.

 

If the doctor helped in getting the people pregnant I could see the scenario. However I do not believe that in your original scenario that happened. They chose to take on a Pregnancy knowing their hopes may be crushed again but that they had a significant chance of that not happening, just like in any other pregnancy.

 
You cannot have it both ways. Abortion is either murder or it is not. None of the pro-lifers would complain if a prosecutor charged a rapist with murder if the rapist happens to rape a woman who was known previously not to be able to carry a child to term and she had another miscarriage.

 

I didn't even attempt to have it both ways. If in your scenario you stated that the woman had zero chance of carrying to term I would agree that what she had done was unconscionable, however you did not state that you said a "good probability" and therefore there was also a probability and a reasonable chance to carry to term.

 
Just like every other death caused by a second party (in my example the mother and father) intention or lack of it may only save you some prison time or spare you the needle. It very rarely gets you free pass.

 

This as I said before is the same decision every parent makes. Since about 1/3 of all pregnancy ends in spontaneous abortion. We cannot simply arrest everybody who gets pregnant unless there was a viable alternative where they could reasonably expect their child to live but chose a different path. In your scenario there was a reasonable idea that the child would survive to term, therefore arresting the hopeful would be damaging rather than an improvement to the existing laws.
 
 
 
The only rights we ACTUALLY have are the ones protected by the government. Not the ones we just THINK we have.

Also you assume everyone believes in creator given rights. Some people go with just the governemnt ones.

And you probably do not want to upset your creator, he/she probably likes to be capitalised - Creator.

 

That is incorrect. There is a reason that Amendment IX was put into the Constitution. There was a reasonable debate that people would assume that only the rights specifically enumerated were protected, and therefore the rights enumerated in the first ten amendments were left out of the original Constitution so that there could be more debate about them. Amendment IX protects other rights that are not enumerated.

Rights can be infringed upon by the Government and even sometimes denied by the Government but that doesn't take from you the actual Right.

Assume that the Government didn't have the 1st Amendment and we had an official state religion. If you were like myself and believed in a different religion then your right to choose your religion would be infringed by the Government but you would still have the right. There are numerous things you could do, form quiet underground churches, foment rebellion, etc. The Government may deem it illegal but you can take steps to secure your necessary freedoms regardless. This was based on the idea that God would not find your transgressions sinful if you took action to secure your religious freedom even though the Government may believe you had transgressed. Thus God gives you Rights and the Government either protects those rights or infringes upon them but it doesn't grant them to you they are yours by nature of being human.
 
 
Well said, No1ToVoteFor,

One of the obvious reasons why this concept is so important is exactly that. If our rights come from our Creator, whoever/whatever that is, and not the Government, than no Goverment can take those rights away from us.

The founding fathers were intelligent enough to know that if they put their most important rights in the hands of men...that men could eventually decide to take those rights away...however, if we were born with these rights...then no man could decide that he didn't like some rights and wanted to get rid of them.

You should be very wary of anyone who seems more interested in putting those rights into the hands of men, than keeping them inalienable.
 
 
Here's an interesting piece. A church holds a funeral for aborted fetuses and cremates the remains. Note the reaction from the pro-abortion people... they call the church "a bunch of religious fanatics", threaten to sue over trumped up charges. They also have a problem with giving the fetuses a proper burial (which reminds me of how the Nazis disposed of their victims' remains at the death camps --- they dumped their ashes or their bodies into large pits). Of course I have to give the Nazis credit, at least they buried their victims, rather than throw them in the trash or flush them down a toilet.

Colorado is sure getting in the news alot lately. This Church has been doing this for years. They wanted to go to the press this time so that people who have had abortions and wanted a place to greive knew where they could go.

Some lady at the church was on the radio this morning, she was the one that set up the whole thing. She said that every time the Mortuary hired a new person they were always shocked at how recognizable the remains were and horrified at the practice. Crist Mortuary contacted the Church in order to get the burials done as they felt they deserved better than what they were to receive.

I'll start with this one being wrong. YOU CAN CHARGE THE DRIVER WITH KILLING THE FETUS NOW. If there was any possibility the driver did anything wrong he would be charged with two deaths. If the criminal case failed it would might win in civil court. It would only make it easier to charge the driver. So the mother will be no more responsible than she is now, but everyone who interacts with her will be. That makes goos sense.

Also I CAN CHARGE EVERY DRUNK DRIVER WITH A CRIME. Even if they do not actually do anything else wrong. They are being irresponsible. They are takiung a chance. Women who are told by doctors that they are MOSTLY LIKELY to not carry to term are being irresponsible. How is that different again? Because you want it to be. That is not a good argument.

Once again, when making a law you need to see if it is an improvement for society or a nightmare of Government invasion. In this case for one person I can see your point. However in order to regulate every pregnancy to such a minimal fashion you would need to create a bureaucracy that would oversee every pregnancy, making sure that every woman knows correctly how to be pregnant and when they can get pregnant. At this point, I do not see an improvement but a horrible inconvenient and invasive government agency creating an impossible situation that would not lead to an improvement in society.

In every case you must have a give and take on laws. I choose to draw the line at who gets pregnant, you obviously want the line drawn even further. I simply do not want the direct and knowledgable action of killing babies for convenience; you, however, begin to think of how to regulate their behavior from the beginning.

What would the benefit to society be to create a law where getting pregnant itself would be illegal and who would that law hurt the most, or help the most?

Why on earth would you think we needed a government agency to oversee when women get pregnant. i dont think the government can regulate that because people are going to have sex regardless if the government tries. I dont think anyone has proposed that the government do so either. All the prolifers are arguing is that we need to protect the life that has already been created through the mothers actions. Why would we need a buearacracy to take care of that when there are doctors who have sworn oaths to do so and are paid in the private sector?

The guy asked a specific question about one instance where a prospective Mother had a spontaneous abortion and then was told that there was a high probability if she got pregnant again for another spontaneous abortion. The question he asked was should we arrest her if she decided to get pregnant again and did have another spontaneous abortion. My answer was proscribed above then extended with the answer you see above your reply.

As I said before having the Government tell people when they could get pregnant by arresting and prosecuting this particular hopeful couple is opening a can of worms that I think should remain unopened even if we are successful in changing laws to deny abortion on demand.

Yes of course because the best way to further the baby killing agenda and make it more acceptable is to make those that oppose it look moronic and extreme. The truth really kills liberals!!
 
 
From The National Review:

 
Dead Reckoning
Roe at 25.

By The Editors

EDITOR'S NOTE: This editorial appeared piece appears in the January 26, 1998, January 31, 2005, issue of National Review.
A quarter-century has passed since the Supreme Court struck down the laws of every state in the nation, in the name of a constitutional right to abortion it had just discovered. In Roe v. Wade, the Court prohibited any regulation of abortion in the first trimester, allowed only regulations pertaining to the health of the mother in the second, and mandated that any regulation in the third make an exception for maternal health. In the companion case of Doe v. Bolton, the Court insisted on the broadest definition of health  economic, familial, emotional. Legal scholar Mary Ann Glendon describes the result as the most radical pro-abortion policy in the democratic world. It permits abortion at any stage of pregnancy, for any reason or for no reason. It has licensed the killing of some thirty-five million members of the human family so far.

The abortion regime was born in lies. In Britain (and in California, pre-Roe), the abortion lobby deceptively promoted legal revisions to allow "therapeutic" abortions and then defined every abortion as "therapeutic." The abortion lobby lied about Jane Roe, claiming her pregnancy resulted from a gang rape. It lied about the number of back-alley abortions. Justice Blackmun relied on fictitious history to argue, in Roe, that abortion had never been a common law crime.

The abortion regime is also sustained by lies. Its supporters constantly lie about the radicalism of Roe: even now, most Americans who "agree with Roe v. Wade" in polls think that it left third-term abortions illegal and restricted second-term abortions. They have lied about the frequency and "medical necessity" of partial-birth abortion. Then there are the euphemisms: "terminating a pregnancy," abortion "providers," "products of conception." "The fetus is only a potential human being"  as if it might as easily become an elk. "It should be between a woman and her doctor"  the latter an abortionist who has never met the woman before and who has a financial interest in her decision. This movement cannot speak the truth.

Roe's supporters said at the time that the widespread availability of abortion would lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies, hence less child abuse; it has not. They said that fewer women would die from back-alley abortions; the post-1940s decline in the number of women who died from abortions, the result of antibiotics, actually slowed after Roe  probably because the total number of abortions rose. They said it would reduce illegitimacy and child poverty, predictions that now seem like grim jokes.

Pro-lifers were, alas, more prescient. They claimed the West had started down the slippery slope of a progressive devaluation of human life. After the unborn would come the elderly and the infirm  more burdens to others; more obstacles to others' goals; probably better off dead, like "unwanted children." And so now we are debating whether to allow euthanasia, whether to create embryos for experimental purposes, whether to permit the killing of infants about to leave the womb.

And what greater claim on our protection, after all, does that infant have a moment after birth? He still lacks the attributes of "personhood"  rationality, autonomy, rich interactions  that pro-abortion philosophers consider the preconditions of a right to life. The argument boils down to this assertion: If we want to eliminate you and you cannot stop us, we are justified in doing it. Might makes right. Among intellectuals, infanticide is in the first phase of a movement from the unthinkable to the arguable to the debatable to the acceptable.

Everything abortion touches, it corrupts. It has corrupted family life. In the war between the sexes, abortion tilts the playing field toward predatory males, giving them another excuse for abandoning their offspring: She chose to carry the child; let her pay for her choice. Our law now says, in effect, that fatherhood has no meaning, and we are shocked that some men have learned that lesson too well. It has corrupted the Supreme Court, which has protected the abortion license even while tacitly admitting its lack of constitutional grounding. If the courts can invent such a right, unmoored in the text, tradition, or logic of the Constitution, then they can do almost anything; and so they have done. The law on everything from free speech to biotechnology has been distorted to accommodate abortionism. And abortion has deeply corrupted the practice of medicine, transforming healers into killers.

Most of all, perhaps, it has corrupted liberalism. For all its flaws, liberalism could until the early seventies claim a proud history of standing up for the powerless and downtrodden, of expanding the definition of the community for whom we pledge protection, of resisting the idea that might makes right. The Democratic Party has casually abandoned that legacy. Liberals' commitment to civil rights, it turns out, ends when the constituency in question can offer neither votes nor revenues.

Abortion-on-demand has, however, also called into being in America a pro-life movement comprising millions of ordinary citizens. Their largely unsung efforts to help pregnant women in distress have prevented countless abortions. And their political witness has helped maintain a pro-life ethic that has stopped millions more. The conversions of conscience have almost all been to the pro-life side  Bernard Nathanson, Nat Hentoff, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese. The conversions of convenience have mostly gone the other way, mainly, politicians who wanted to get ahead in the Democratic Party  Jesse Jackson, Dick Gephardt. The fight against abortion has resulted in unprecedented dialogue and cooperation between Catholics and Protestants, first on moral values and now on theological ones. It has helped transform the Republican Party from a preserve of elite WASPs into a populist and conservative party.

True, few politicians of either party  with honorable exceptions like Henry Hyde, Chris Smith, Jesse Helms, Bob Casey, Charles Canady, and Rick Santorum  have provided leadership in the struggle. Not because opposition to abortion is unpopular  throughout the Roe era, 70 percent of the public has supported laws that would prohibit 90 percent of abortions  but because politicians, and even more the consultants and journalists and big-money donors to whom they listen, tend to move in elite circles where accepting abortion is de rigueur and pro-life advocacy at best an offense against good taste. Since everyone they know favors legal abortion, they understandably conclude that everyone does. But there is progress even here. The pro-abortion intellectual front is crumbling. Supporters of the license increasingly concede that what they support is, indeed, the taking of human life. Pro-lifers, their convictions rooted in firmer soil, have not had to make reciprocal concessions.

There can be little doubt that, left to the normal workings of democracy, abortion laws would generally be protective of infants in the womb. The main obstacle on our path to a society where every child is welcomed in life and protected in law, then, remains what it has always been: the Supreme Court. There abortionism is well entrenched; and last year the Court appeared to slam the door on the legal possibility of a congressional override of its decisions on abortion or anything else. By defining a practice at odds with our deep and settled moral convictions as part of the fundamental law of the land, the Supreme Court has created a slow-motion constitutional crisis. This is what comes of courting death.

 
 
 
 
I don't believe for a second that CivilLiberty is implying anything of the sort. I DO however, believe that CivilLiberty feels that his opinion on this subject is obvious and logical...and what I, and others, are trying to point out is that when it comes to this subject, people arriving to the same conclusion as he is isn't logical.

He was originally saying that something that small couldn't be human. Now he is saying that something without a developed brain (we don't know what HIS definition of appropriate brain development for life is) is not human.

What he is missing is that most ardently pro-life people are not saying that a one-month-old fetus is the same type of human as a 12-year-old child...but rather that it has the potential to reach that same status, and that it is quite actively working towards becoming that status...it isn't the woman's body, it is another body...growing, changing, and developing, more and more every second....and that because it would become a fully-functional human being if left alone killing it because it would be tough to have to wear maternity clothes for 9 months and then to give the child up for adoption would just be really embarrassing...is NOT a good enough reason to kill a living, growing "potential" human.

 

That is exactly right!!! I would also say that everyone who has children, or nieces, nephews, smaller siblings.......Take a good look at them now, the way they look and act, think, interract with them, and how much you care for them. NOw try to imagine if they had been aborted, you would have terminated everything that they have become or would have become, because they were destined to look, be, sound, just as they do right now give or take a little due to upbringing, nutrition, adult supervision etc....

You would have killed and stopped that from happening, and this argument has nothing to do with feelings, or religion, but of science and the natural progression of life form zygote to embryo, to fetus..........that's the bottom line. As a species we have no right to interfere with that process.
 
 
Outstanding post, Gem. Aptly titled, too.
 
 
One of the things I found most interesting about the article was that many of the reasons given by pro-abortion advocates prior to Roe V. Wade to allow abortions have been shown to be demonstrably false and untrue. The things that they felt legalizing abortion would "fix" have not been fixed, and in many cases, they have just gotten worse.

Legalizing abortion hasn't solved any of the problem people thought it would...and one could make a compelling argument that legalized abortion has caused far more problems on top of those problems that already existed and have grown worse.

Is it appropriate to blame abortions for an increase in poverty? No, of course not. But we should not allow pro-abortion supporters to ignore the fact that their predecessors fought for the right to abort based, in part, on the argument that it would LESSEN poverty.

We tried abortions on demand...what we ended up with was an abortion industry that makes hundreds of millions of dollars...all while claiming to be disinterested in the financial benefits of the business, an increase in the areas we were told would decrease if abortions were legalized, an entire generation of women silently mourning the part they played in the murder of their unborn children, and millions upon millions of babies killed.

When is it going to be alright for our society to say that we tried this experiment out...and it didn't work...and now it is time to try something else?

Great question! I suspect the answer if left up to the Pro-abortion Industry will be NEVER!
 
 
 
Once again, when making a law you need to see if it is an improvement for society or a nightmare of Government invasion. In this case for one person I can see your point. However in order to regulate every pregnancy to such a minimal fashion you would need to create a bureaucracy that would oversee every pregnancy, making sure that every woman knows correctly how to be pregnant and when they can get pregnant. At this point, I do not see an improvement but a horrible inconvenient and invasive government agency creating an impossible situation that would not lead to an improvement in society.

In every case you must have a give and take on laws. I choose to draw the line at who gets pregnant, you obviously want the line drawn even further. I simply do not want the direct and knowledgable action of killing babies for convenience; you, however, begin to think of how to regulate their behavior from the beginning.

What would the benefit to society be to create a law where getting pregnant itself would be illegal and who would that law hurt the most, or help the most?

 

Actually I am not trying to draw any lines. You want abortion to be illegal  therefore fetuses are people, therefore killing them is murder. Now I am asking how do you think your new line works? I am suggesting that it does not. I could care less about regulating pregnancies. I am regulating murder which is what the law currently does.

How can you draw a line at who gets pregnant? As a matter of fact that is unclear in its meaning to begin with, but I will attempt point out its shortcomings.

So at what point does a woman who cannot have children get arrested for trying over and over and over? Never apparently. But if she has two drinks and then a miscarriage, of a child she was mostly likely never going to have (aw shucks, but she really, really wanted to have a baby and that means the fetus is a person, but she can never be held accountable unless some outside influence causes the miscarriage), both she and the bartender are looking at prison time. This makes great sense.

Fertility clinics will be out of the question. To get pregnant they make like 30 or more zygotes and often result in large numbers of fetuses, some of which are selectively aborted. Who can have 4 or 5 babies at once? And after she gives birth she will HAVE to return to the clinic to bear the other zygotes to term or she and the husband and the clinic are all murderers. They created life with the full knowledge that some of the zygotes will die. These people really want to be pregnant and have children, so I guess they are ok.

Or your law only applies to people who get pregnant naturally?

So where is the line again?

For people who want to have babies it is always ok to get abortions or have miscarriages despite any previous indication that they cannot have children, but if a woman might be pregnant and does not want to have a baby then it is never ok?

The gives and takes must be applied equally. That is what I trying to understand. So your law is better why?

If they feel guilty that is their problem. No one MADE them get abotions. It was an OPTION. What is so difficult to understand about this? Prolifers should stop being idiots. Yes you are idiots. STOP WOMAN FROM WANTING ABORTIONS. Making them illegal is like outlawing marijuana. IT DOES NOT AND WILL NEVER WORK.

Yes medicine is an industry. Abortions are performed by doctors, members of the medical industry. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY MAKING THEM ILLEGAL WILL NOT STOP THEM. Doctors will set up clinics in Canada and Mexico and charge even more and make even more money. Fighting the drug war makes drugs more expensive not less.

PLEASE choose the right battle.

Serious question, not trying to put you on the spot, but can you site where in the Supreme court decision the lessening of poverty is given as motive for their decision?
 
 
Bonnie: "Yes of course because the best way to further the baby killing agenda and make it more acceptable is to make those that oppose it look moronic and extreme. The truth really kills liberals!!"

That is my question - Are you serious?

I'm not positive,but I don't think anyone resorted to calling you names because of your stanse. Have you ever thought that maybe the majority of abortions are performed on women that were just irresponsible? Maybe that is an idiotic thing to do. You call prolifers idiots,yet who is the one calling names? You say outlawing abortion will never work. At some point it did. But have you ever stopped to think that maybe if a woman knows that she doesn't have an easy out like an abortion that maybe she will act a little more responsibly? Yes,some unwanted prgnancies will still happen,but I bet the number would decrease. There are too many women that use it as a form of birth control.

I am sorry. But for the record, I was the one calling names. You can call me names if will make you feel better.

Now, did you get my point? Well apperently not. The law did not work before - that is why it was changed. Ok now dealing with the current reality. The world is 'smaller' (that is, travel and information are cheaper) and abortions,relative to income cost much less expensive now than they did 40 years ago. Illegal in the U.S. does not stop anything. It would be a completely hollow victory, wouldn't it?

So you are all for actively teaching and advocating ALL information on how not to get pregnant. And to ALL girls and women of any age that possibly could get pregnant.

We can have ads that follow the Viagra and Cialis and Girls Gone Wild ads right?

Now I have not done well on this board with examples, bt I will try another:

You said,"But have you ever stopped to think that maybe if a woman knows that she doesn't have an easy out like an abortion that maybe she will act a little more responsibly? "

Yes because I am not an idiot. Sorry to disappoint you.

There are many studies PROVING that every safety innovation made for automobiles has CAUSED MORE accidents. So to stop people who do not drive well from raising my insurance rates, I would like to remove safety devices from there cars. Teenagers being the worst drivers will get no air bags or safety belts or crumple zones, etc.

People who get one DUI should have their safety belts removed. A second DUI will mean you are issued a motorcycle, no helmet.

This is genius right?
 
 
 
Bonnie: "Yes of course because the best way to further the baby killing agenda and make it more acceptable is to make those that oppose it look moronic and extreme. The truth really kills liberals!!"

Yes, I am serious... when pro-choice advocates go out of their way to demean and degrade a church for having a funeral for aborted babies as a way to show they are against such practices it shows that they are doing everything they can to impune those that think abortion is murder certainly the effect they wish to have to is to take away credibility from the pro-life movement and further their agenda making abortion more acceptable.

What part of that isn't true?? If the pro-choice movement is so damn sure they are right then why do they care if people protest abortion???? What's the problem??

So how about you provide some number comparisons of the amount of abortions performed before it was "legal" and then the numbers of abortions after?

If restricting abortions will not serve as a deterent, then prove it!!
 
 
 
What part of that isn't true?? If the pro-choice movement is so damn sure they are right then why do they care if people protest abortion???? What's the problem??

 

Sure to be right about what? What are you talking about? If you respond to anything please clarify what the last part of your post means.

I could not care less if churches want to have funerals. Maybe the clinics could work with the churches if that makes everyone feel better.

The problem with pro-lifers protesting? None really. But have you ever seen a group of pro-choicers in front of a church protesting your religion? You can believe what you want. Would you feel better if someone wrote down "God says abortion is OK by Him." and called it a religious text. You would not have to believe it, but someone else could.

Not everyone believes the Bible.

I have idea what you are asking here, excpet possibly the part I said if the pro-choice movement is so sure they are right in supporting abortion, then why do they have such problem with pro-life demonstrations??

 
I could not care less if churches want to have funerals. Maybe the clinics could work with the churches if that makes everyone feel better.

 

Now this one is hysterical as I was pointing to an earlier post that was an article about a church having a funeral for aborted babies, and the all out assault the pro-choicers made on this church and it's congregation for being stupid and radical. And I made this point to illustrate my point about pro-choice advocates mocking those that disagree with them in order to take away pro-life advocates credibility. Savvy?

 
The problem with pro-lifers protesting? None really. But have you ever seen a group of pro-choicers in front of a church protesting your religion?

 

As a matter of fact I have right in front of St Patricks Cathedral in Manhattan, to the point there were some that were arrested for manhandling those trying to get into the church for worship, but that's really not the point and has nothing to do with what i said in my previous post regarding protests in general

 
You can believe what you want. Would you feel better if someone wrote down "God says abortion is OK by Him." and called it a religious text. You would not have to believe it, but someone else could.

 

This one I have no idea what your talking about? It doesn't even make sense???

 
Not everyone believes the Bible

 

.

True and so what does that have to do with Pro-choicers completley disrespecting the opinons and actions of pro-lifers??? By the way a good number of people in the pro-life movent do not beleive in the bible but have a humanistic respect for human life even without religious motivations. I have met many fo these remarkable people.
 
 
Wow....where to begin, Elephant

I suppose I'll start by saying that your generalizations and insults are making you look like childish. Now don't get me wrong, every board needs an asshole or two...but I was under the impression earlier that you DIDN'T want to audition for that role...maybe I was wrong...this is an interesting topic, and we could use more variety of opinion...but its pointless if you can't express yourself without being a tool...

"No one MADE them get abortions" is an interesting statement. Many women, especially young women, who have come forward after their abortions say just the opposite....that they felt INCREDIBLY pressured to get abortions...that there was NO other option mentioned to them...that they were MADE to get an abortion by family, friends, boyfriends, doctors, society...all telling them that going forward with the pregnancy while trying to finish highschool or college would be impossible.

For most women the only reasonable "option," as you put it...is abortion.
To downplay that as you have is to demonstrate that you have your eyes closed to the abortion industry and the reality of an unwanted or unexpected pregnancy.

 
Yes medicine is an industry. Abortions are performed by doctors, members of the medical industry. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY MAKING THEM ILLEGAL WILL NOT STOP THEM. Doctors will set up clinics in Canada and Mexico and charge even more and make even more money. Fighting the drug war makes drugs more expensive not less.
PLEASE choose the right battle.

 

I agree with you in most of what you have said here, abortions will always be available in the world, many doctors would continue to perform them. But in your rush to insult people you missed simply ASKING people how they planned on dealing with the obvious problems that would arise from making abortions illegal...

For instance, I am not in support of making abortions illegal. I'm in support of drastically altering the system as it exists today.

 
Serious question, not trying to put you on the spot, but can you site where in the Supreme court decision the lessening of poverty is given as motive for their decision?

 

The Supreme Court's decision in Roe V. Wade was that what occurs between a person and her doctor should remain private, hence one of the reasons it will not be overturned...however, subsequent rulings perverted that ruling...at first Roe v. Wade was only for abortions being available on-demand during the first trimenst, only in the case of the life of the mother in the second and third. Later, it became more and more lax...until it got to the point where the "health of the mother" included emotional stress, economic stability...or simply not wanting a baby right then.

The Supreme Court looked at many options and reasons for their decision...however, as we have seen in the past...sometimes laws and rulings change based upon new information...and as so many argue regarding gun rights, seperation of church and state, etc....we must constantly be working towards a legal system that works with our society as it exists today.

To deny that many of the reasons people fought for abortions turned out to be utter bullshit is again, to either be ignorant of the subject matter, or to be unwilling to educate yourself because you are unwilling to change your already decided upon opinion.

Serious question, not to put you on the spot, elephant...but can I ask you whether your are male or female and your age, or at the very least where you are in life? Highschool, college, young adult, middle aged, however you would like to classify yourself?
 
 
 
So how about you provide some number comparisons of the amount of abortions performed before it was "legal" and then the numbers of abortions after?

If restricting abortions will not serve as a deterrent, then prove it!!

 

How about you prove that it is? I already have the law on my side.

Also this will not stop people from wanting them. I have suggested that stopping the demand for abortions would be a better strategy for prolifers to take. But that would be too hard I imagine. It would take actual work which might inconvience you. I would hate for you to miss church.

Before you respond. You will NEVER be able to get the number of abortions performed before the law was changed (Maybe this is why you asked me to do it, you thought I was really dumb or maybe you would really like to know the answer). Why? 1) You cannot track the number of abortions performed by doctors accurately because they were ILLEGAL. People were probably not reporting when they got one to Census Bureau 2) You cannot get data for the number of Americans that left the U.S. to get them abroad. 3) You will need the number of people who intentionally caused their spontaneous abortion without any doctor assistance - these will be missing from any records anywhere 4) Did doctors find loopholes in the law and perform them right in their offices, calling it something else? You need to count these to.

Now you need to account for change in population. So I would like an accurate per capita number and please cite your sources accurately.

Finally I would appreciate a well developed argument that IF the per capita number of abortions has increased that it is BECAUSE of the change in the abortion laws. Cause and effect are important in this kind of argument.

I could easily argue that this theoretical change is because women are better educated or the opportunity cost of having a child has increased for women (that means they make more money than they did 40 years ago). There are a number of good arguments that the law changing is not the reason any apparent change in the number of abortions.

And make sure the change is statistically significant.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Just because something is legal doesn't make it right! Supreme court justices are falable and make bad decisions all the time based on their own biases.

There are many pro-life groups that do exaclty that and that is the foundation for all of their efforts. There are foundations all over the country that provide all kinds of alternatives to abortion, and even provide schooling, career training, shelter, food, while the mother carries her baby to term, then she can decide of she wants to keep it or give it up for adoption, and all of this is done thru the volunteering and HARD WORK of "church people" and clergy.

 
You will NEVER be able to get the number of abortions performed before the law was changed

 

True but I can give you the numbers of abortions that have been performed after it was legalized and I can gurantee those numbers would dwarf any number even conceived before abortion was legalized. Doesn't matter that there were back alley abortions and they can not be counted, so don't even go there!

 
(Maybe this is why you asked me to do it,

 

I asked becasue you made a sweeping statement that in no way would making abortion illegal make them occur less, so I wanted you to back that up, which of course you can't!!! And the fact that many would still want to have abortions well so what, many people want to steal money, but most don't because it's illegal!!
 
 
 
Wow....where to begin, Elephant

 

Well at the beginning would be nice.

What generalizations? People love to throw out garbage facts all over this board. I am usually just voicing my opinion. You should address the generalizations instead of just generalizing. Seriously are you getiing to all of them below. If not I would be happy to clarify anything that was too general.

Whatever. I am sticking to my guns on this one. No one made them do it. Lack of information, evil boyfriends, the system keeping women down - not my fault. You want to stop abortions then you should spread the newer, better, more insightful information. Abortions will decrease, you will be happy.

 
For most women the only reasonable "option," as you put it...is abortion.
To downplay that as you have is to demonstrate that you have your eyes closed to the abortion industry and the reality of an unwanted or unexpected pregnancy.

 

Actually I said I agree that abortion is a very large and lucrative industry. I even said that making it illegal would cause a run on franchising abortion clinics along our borders and those companies would be traded on the NYSE.

 
I agree with you in most of what you have said here, abortions will always be available in the world, many doctors would continue to perform them. But in your rush to insult people you missed simply ASKING people how they planned on dealing with the obvious problems that would arise from making abortions illegal...

 

Thanks.., and I have asked numerous questions about how it would be handled and there came a point where the answers were, to paraphrase myself, idiotic. So I got frustrated. And like you I am hurt that everyone here thinks I am pro-choice. I just dont care. I want things to stay the same, because the current laws are more easily enforced than any proposed laws I have seen.

 
For instance, I am not in support of making abortions illegal. I'm in support of drastically altering the system as it exists today.

Later, it became more and more lax...until it got to the point where the "health of the mother" included emotional stress, economic stability...or simply not wanting a baby right then.

 

Sounds like we need to take a look at that. So much easier to move toward more the lax is it not?

 
The Supreme Court looked at many options and reasons for their decision...however, as we have seen in the past...sometimes laws and rulings change based upon new information...and as so many argue regarding gun rights, seperation of church and state, etc....we must constantly be working towards a legal system that works with our society as it exists today.

 

Uh-huh. (Hoo-ray for guns) What does not work now, by the way?

 
To deny that many of the reasons people fought for abortions turned out to be utter bullshit is again, to either be ignorant of the subject matter, or to be unwilling to educate yourself because you are unwilling to change your already decided upon opinion.

 

No. I am just saying that protestors and lawyers have different arguments. Just because you hear an argument at a rally just means that it appeals to the group at hand. I really only care about the legal arguments.

And you will find it difficult to change my mind because I do not agree with pro-choicers. Life does start at conception. I just do not put the same value on it as a fully formed and functional human. I am not really into potential people. That said I would want to have the child if my girlfriend/wife were pregnant. But then again I do not have any reason not to. My life is pretty good.

(You did a better job than I did. Making your insults veiled behind an impenetrable argument. "If you disagree you lack the education and possibly the intellectual capacity to see why you are wrong and now I pity you." It is very nice. But now what do I do. If I agrue against you can always just say it is because I am stupid or I am unwilling to learn, both of which are bad. You should leave me a third option.)

 
Serious question, not to put you on the spot, elephant...but can I ask you whether your are male or female and your age, or at the very least where you are in life? Highschool, college, young adult, middle aged, however you would like to classify yourself?

 

Now you must be kidding. No one knows anything about anybody else on these boards. I think it should stay that way.

I am elephant, the ultimate conservative, enough said.

Ill have some to say later, but I have to go for now.

True but I can give you the numbers of abortions that have been performed after it was legalized and I can gurantee those numbers would dwarf any number even conceived before abortion was legalized. Doesn't matter that there were back alley abortions and they can not be counted, so don't even go there!

I asked becasue you made a sweeping statement that in no way would making abortion illegal make them occur less, so I wanted you to back that up, which of course you can't!!!

 

OK, so what are these awesome, dwarfing numbers again? I can back up anything currently - at least as well as you can. There is no good information supporting either of us.

Also you have not addressed the cause/effect relationship. That would be helpful.

By the way did you see the relationship with the car example I gave.

Here are some good numbers

From the CDC approx. 32 million legal abortions have been performed since 1970.

The per 1000 U.S. population numbers look like this:

0.918562093 1970
2.286959146 1971
2.737767645 1972
2.84668188 1973

3.086596785 1998

Calculated as CDC reported # of legal abortions divided by the the population actuals and estimates (the Census' estimates) in thousands for the US from the Census.

So they went up like we both expected. Ans then they went down as I had suspected. Changing people's minds will work. Stick with that plan - see you are winning. They are down 45% since the peak in 1989.

I like these numbers better. The sources are reputable.

Now let's work on the cause and effect part of the argument.
 
 
If one assumes a fetus is a baby, way too many. Actually one is too many.
 
 
Another interesting opinion on rights of unborn children and their mothers...while I find the title to be a bit heavy-handed...the letter itself raises some interesting questions.

 
An Open Letter to the Open Minded
by Eugene F. Diamond
Every abortion decision involves a conflict of values. The rights of the developing unborn child are in conflict with the rights of the pregnant woman. Every physician who cares for pregnant women is caring for two patientsthe pregnant woman herself and the unborn child. The pregnant woman frequently is called upon to act in a way that primarily is oriented toward the welfare of her unborn child. She may be asked to optimize her diet, abstain from smoking, or drink alcohol in moderation to protect her fetus. She may even be called upon to submit to procedures such as intrauterine transfusion or various fetal surgical measures to improve the condition of the infant without producing any direct benefit to herself. There is some disagreement about the ethical obligations of the mother in each instance, but few would claim that a mother may act with callous discard for the welfare of the fetus. No one would claim for example, that a woman is free to take Thalidomide during the first trimester of pregnancy.

The long tradition of legal constraints against the practice of abortion in the United States was derivative of English common law, operative in colonial times during the framing of the Constitution, and codified into laws of every state for over a century. This tradition was interrupted in 1973 by the Supreme Court in its Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions. The legalization of abortion was based on a constitutional right to privacy, but it was contingent on a declaration by the Court that the pre-viable fetus lacked personhood. It should be emphasized that the Court was discussing personhood in the legal sense of standing before the Court. It was not considering personhood in a broader philosophical or metaphysical sense and, in fact, specifically refrained from a decision as to when life begins.

The existence of biologically independent life in the unborn from the time of conception is supported by the following observations:

Human life can be made to begin under in-vitro conditions by the fertilization of an ovum by sperm.

The zygote and embryo thus produced are independently viable and not part-of the Petri dish or the uterus into which they will be eventually implanted.

Criteria widely recognized as characteristic of life rather than death (e.g., heartbeat. electroencephalographic activity) are present early in the first trimester.

Unborn children have a unique dependency on their mothers, and they will continue to be totally dependent on others long after they are born.

The existence of life is intrinsic and demonstrable. The existence of personhood is extrinsic and conferred by consensus, at times arbitrarily (the Supreme Court, for example, in the Dred Scott decision declared black slaves to be non-persons or chattel for purposes of the law). The Harvard Conference on Abortion, in both its ethical and medical committees, concluded unanimously that life begins at fertilization. Expert testimony before the East Committee in the senate regarding the beginning of life fell into two categories: 1) life begins at conception (majority view) or 2) when life begins is uncertain (minority view).

If we conclude that when life begins is uncertain, we have a serious quandary. If we conclude that a human life or a human person does not exist until some arbitrary stage of life after conception (e.g., implantation, nervous system development, viability, or birth) we may feel free to carry out lethal measures against pre-born individuals against whom we have passed this judgment. If we are incorrect, there is no remedy for the individual who has thus suffered wrongful death. If, on the other hand, we extend protection to all stages in the human continuum, we avoid the wrongful death without causing any injustice to the unborn individual in the process. It has been customary in other contexts in the American experience to act in favor of life where the existence of life is uncertain. When there is a coalmine cave-in, for example, we do not board up the shaft but rather we dig for survivors. In almost every instance, we continue to dig even when we are morally convinced that the oxygen supply has been long exhausted. It would seem reasonable to act similarly with regard to unborn children. That is, presume that they qualify for protection unless and until we can be certain that they are not live human persons.

Recently, in San Francisco, an unborn child was partially removed from the womb in order to have a renal tract obstruction repaired. After the surgery, the child was replaced in the womb to continue the pregnancy. Was this a person while out of the womb and then a non-person again when back inside? Or, since the procedure involves the removal of the lower half of the body from the womb, did the child achieve personhood for its buttocks but not for its brain? These are the scientific anomalies of the Supreme Court's decision. No wonder Justice Sandra Day OConnor has said that Roe v. Wade is on a collision course with itself.

 
 
 
can you imagine the job market and the number of people on welfare if all 40 million of these babies had been born....
 
 
I wonder if a few of those 40 million would have done anything worthwhile with their lives, other than get on wellfare....good thing that ghandi's mom decided not to abort him...or jfk, fdr, martin luther king, jr., beethovan's mom, pick your top 10 most respected influential people on earth today right now...do you think that in the 40 million aborted babies there might possibly have been one that would have done something remarkable??? guess we'll never know now...but good thing that all those women who had abortions because they didn't really like the guy they f*cked had the freedom to do so...
 
 
In order to have "choice", we have......

1. Taken away the right of voters in all states to decide whether or not abortion should be legal in their state.
2. Taken away the right of parents to be informed of their daughters' decision to have an abortion and their right to consent
3. Taken away the right of fathers to have a say in whether their unborn children live or die
4. Taken away the right of people to freely practice their religion without fear of being taken to court
5. Denied people the decency of a proper burial
6. Denied people the right to life without due process of law
7. Trashed the First, Tenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution
8. Weakened the foundation of our freedoms and eroded the moral fabric of western civilization and of common decency

..... in short, for the convenience of a few, we've taken away the rights of many........... some choice!

"Originally Posted by KarlMarx
Here's an interesting piece. A church holds a funeral for aborted fetuses and cremates the remains."

Yes of course because the best way to further the baby killing agenda and make it more acceptable is to make those that oppose it look moronic and extreme. The truth really kills liberals!!

 

What is moronic and extreme is a church stealing other people's terminated embryos and performing this ceremony. If the church were doing this WITH PERMISSION from the woman involved, it would be a different matter.

No doubt. Terminating an unwanted pregnancy before that zygote or embryo becomes a person - before it develops into a thinking, feeling human, destined to live a life of poverty and suffering, is choice every woman has the right to make.

Obviously, because it's *her* body.

That it's her body gives her more than 50% say. Let's say the man get 49% say - that still gives the woman 51%, which is controlling interest.

If it is a bunch of cells and not a living being then why would it matter what the Church had done with those cells? If people really believed in the bunch of cells argument all it would be is a giggle as they are praying over tissue and not human life. This belies the argument that all aborted offspring are only a bunch of cells.

At what point does that happen? Most abortions, in fact over 99 percent take place after brain function begins at 40 days. Almost no abortion other than spontaneous abortion takes place at the zygote level. At 40 days there is brain function and a heartbeat the life is no longer undifferentiated cells.

Almost all abortions take place in the second trimester when the fetus actually attempts to move away from the devices used to terminate their life, ineffectual defense but a defense nonetheless.

Have you ever watched the video at silentscream.org? It may give you some interesting things on which to think at the least.

Certainly if that 45% down since 1990 is accurate then yes that is good news in one way, and I would add that part of the reason for that is due to many things, more parental and religious involvement, addressing the problem before it becomes a problem.

Im curious to hear what your thoughts and ideas are on addressing cause and effect?? In what way other than what's being done now, would be effective in your opinion?

True they were born into wealth or middelclass families, but so what, just as many grew up poor, and did extremely well for themsleves.

Besides, today very few people are not taken care of by societies safety net, including medical treatment, so there really is no excuse for abortion based on economic reasons

 
Welfare weakens the human spirit - name a famous, heroic, former welfare recipient (not including Rap artists).

 

Colin Powell grew up in Harlem, dont' know if his parents were on welfare but he was dirt poor came from very humble beginnings, and managed okay!! Yes Welfare weakens the human spirit and Im glad Clinton was talked into signing the Welfare Reform Act
 
 
Holy crap!

Look people...

Poverty STRENGTHENS the human spirit. Living an easy life is what causes suicides.

ABUSING Welfare will weaking the spirit, because nobody can 'live' (figuratively) if they are lazy.

Our own Holocaust
(Filed: 23/01/2005)

Thursday is the 60th anniversary of the Russian army's entry into Auschwitz. The discovery of the ruins of that death camp revealed to the world the scale of the Nazi extermination programme. More than a million people were murdered in Auschwitz, the overwhelming majority of them Jews. This grim anniversary will inevitably be an occasion for some smug self-congratulation from politicians: part of the point of reminding ourselves how awful the Nazis were is to tell ourselves of how good we are by comparison.

And yet the moral depravity of the Nazis is not as distant as those horrific pictures of gas chambers and mountains of corpses suggest. Hitler's holocaust began in the 1930s with a policy which was not merely popular in other countries, but frequently practised by them: the forced sterilisation of those deemed "unfit to reproduce" because they were thought to carry a genetic predisposition to mental or physical handicap. Socialist intellectuals in Britain such as George Bernard Shaw were enthusiastic proponents of that policy. The US Supreme Court ruled that forced sterilisation was compatible with the Constitution in 1927, when Oliver Wendell Holmes confidently stated that it was "better for all the world if society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind". Over the next decade, the United States forcibly sterilised more than 20,000 women  a number dwarfed by the Swedes, who only stopped forcibly sterilising women for carrying "defective genes" in the 1970s.

Forced sterilisation is not murder, of course. But the Nazis' slide from the forced sterilisation of the mentally handicapped to their mass murder suggests how slippery the slope from the one to the other can be. As the BBC's outstanding series on Auschwitz demonstrates, the Nazis decided that it was not worth feeding and nursing "gibbering idiots", and that they could not "burden future generations with their care". They claimed that the most "humane" alternative was to exterminate the people they called "useless eaters". They experimented with gas as a discreet method of killing the mentally handicapped before they transferred that innovation to killing Jews. By the summer of 1941, 70,000 disabled people had been killed by being invited into showers  which turned out to dispense not water but carbon monoxide. Three doctors would look at the medical records of a "patient". They would mark the records with a red cross if they thought the individual was a suitable candidate for "evacuation". A majority vote decided his or her fate. The advantages of gassing were that it was hidden from view: shooting people en masse had the effect of turning even SS men into depressed drunks.

There are disturbing parallels with our present laws on abortion. To abort an unborn child beyond 24 weeks' gestation is recognised in British law as infanticide  but only if the child is thought to be "normal". If doctors diagnose physical or mental handicap, including, it seems, a cleft palate, it is lawful to kill the unborn child at any time up to its birth. This is a programme for eliminating the handicapped. Its justification is that it is better "not to burden" either the present or future generations with their care. It differs in practice from the mass murder in Nazi Germany  but it is not easy to articulate how it differs at the level of moral principle. The state is killing unborn children because we do not want to live with them, or to bear the costs of looking after them. It is a justification the Nazis would have appreciated.

About 200,000 unborn children are aborted every year in England and Wales, many because doctors have decided they will be handicapped. That is a killing rate of nearly 550 a day: less than the number of people gassed daily at Auschwitz, but a horrifically large number none the less  and larger than the numbers of defenceless handicapped murdered by the Nazis.

We have successfully disguised the enormity of what we are doing from ourselves, just as the Nazis did. Next Thursday should not be an occasion for congratulating ourselves on how far we have come from the moral abyss of National Socialism. It should rather prompt an honest recognition of how disturbingly close our abortion laws have taken us to it.

FALSE. 80% of abortions take place in the FIRST trimester.

And plenty of terminations happen at the zygote level, but they are not called abortions (result of morning after pill) and thus don't make it into the statistic.

Andy

I've always wondered about guys who were all for abortions--is this some white knight thing you got going on or do you just not want to be responsible for what you may create ?

Many anti abortionists ARE fanatics, and so yes, they stand out.

 
.......It's really a very simple idea. The pro-chioce movement is very good at PR and they make a lot of money from abortions...

 

Right. Planned Parenthood is a NON PROFIT organization. This argument that there's some sort of corporate "abortion industry" is just plain loony.

If you want to separate yourself from the fanatic element, this would be a good argument to NOT use.

 
By the way most pro-lifers don't even spend time on trying to change the law, they spend their time changing minds one potential mother at a time by giving them viable alternatives to abortion, and praying to change minds and hearts.

Well it is an indicator of the fact that education and information, NOT CHANGING THE LAW, can achieve the result that prolifers seem so eager to achieve, but are too lazy to work for. I have been saying (you would have to read all the posts and see someone asked me to prove something - which was unprovable for numerous reasons - BUT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME) that making abaortion illegal is not the answer. The government will not be able to achieve what prolifers want with a stroke of the pen. The prolifers must actually put in time and effort and if others agree with them the number of abortions will decline. The numbers were used as an indicator that this may very well be true.

And so prolifers should not try to convince you, Civil, that life begins at conception or that you will burn in hell for even supporting the right to choose (you have indicated that you will never believe these things), but instead direct their efforts at informing you how to make responsible decisions about sex and the responsibilities that come with being a sexually active adult.

Why are you so angry about a few statistics anyway? And if the quotes indicate you doubt their validity - I did the best I could. They came from the CDC database and then I put them in per thousand terms using the Census Bureau population info. Check for yourself. I doubt the CDC or Census are out to trick me. But you may have different ideas.
 
 
 
Many anti abortionists ARE fanatics, and so yes, they stand out.

Right. Planned Parenthood is a NON PROFIT organization. This argument that there's some sort of corporate "abortion industry" is just plain loony.

If you want to separate yourself from the fanatic element, this would be a good argument to NOT use.

All fine with that.

I completely support a position where you are against abortion, yet also against abortion prohibition laws.

Andy

 

how about equal rights for men and women laws?
 
 
 
I've always wondered about guys who were all for abortions--is this some white knight thing you got going on or do you just not want to be responsible for what you may create ?

 

Well, as we've noted before, I write the civil liberties column for About.com, and my interest is in civil liberties. Privacy, and the right to do what you will to your own body are core civil liberties.

and being a parent isn't a liberty that men have?
 
 
 
Well it is an indicator of the fact that education and information, NOT CHANGING THE LAW, can achieve the result that prolifers seem so eager to achieve, but are too lazy to work for.

 

I agree 1000%.

Yes, I'm all for education and free speech and free thinking. I'm NOT for prohibitions.

I think you misunderstand - those stats don't make me angry, nor do I question them. I was merely pointing out that the causation may have to do with the self interest of not dying from a deadly disease.

Surely as an expert in the field you must realize that the rights of individuals clash---your whole reasoning for being pro Roe v Wade is that the fetus is in the woman therefore she should control it? bizarre !
 
 
 
FALSE. 80% of abortions take place in the FIRST trimester.

Andy

 

Assuming that's true, that would still put them solidly in the 99% of abortions which take place AFTER brain function begins.
 
 
 
Surely as an expert in the field you must realize that the rights of individuals clash---your whole reasoning for being pro Roe v Wade is that the fetus is in the woman therefore she should control it? bizarre !

 

it pains me to agree that men should have the same rights as women! However, to agree with Civil means a woman has to say that she is a victim, that she had NO Control prior to conception.

She does, with the exception of rape, statutory or otherwise. Thus, once concieved, seems to me both parents should have a say-actually neither should be able to execute the child. But, whether one or both want to keep.
 
 
 
And plenty of terminations happen at the zygote level....

Andy

 

"Plenty" - that's a nice, round number. How many, exactly, are there in a "plenty"?
 
 
 
Found a cure for Cancer and AIDS maybe, but your right we will never know.

 

What is this point of this particular argument against abortion? Please enlighten me.
 
 
 
What is this point of this particular argument against abortion? Please enlighten me.

 

Very simply that about 40 million babies have been killed by abortion since 1973 and one or more of those babies could have grown up to accomplish any of those things.

And you still haven't addressed my last post to you.

Ps careful your unreasonable anger towards religious people is really showing in many of your postings....

This assumption that only women can nuture and parent a child makes me want to rattle off ad hominems. I know so many men that have equal or better parenting skills than women I can't count em all. Men have been stereotyped by the shitty dads and this has denied MILLIONS of Dads access to their children even though they are forced by the LAW to pay for them. What kind of equality is that???? If I am married and WE want to have a child and my wife aborts it,---I am deprived of raising and loving MY OWN CHILD.

Explain to my why I should allowed my own child to be killed, Andy.----I really wanna hear this one !!

You've been hitting on this point quite a lot.

It's not the man's body. It's only a *portion* of his genetic material.

Should a man insist that woman GET an abortion?

No. If he does not have THAT right, then he does not have the right to insist that she does NOT get it, either.

As far as parental rights after birth, that's not up for discussion here.

I did not say "most" which indicates more than 50%. I said "many" which indicates at least a plurality, which means more than one.

Obviously "many" is subjective to a point. But I see protests with hundreds of fanatics, and to me, hundreds is certainly many.

Surely as an expert in the field you must realize that the rights of individuals clash---your whole reasoning for being pro Roe v Wade is that the fetus is in the woman therefore she should control it? bizarre !

 

Of course I understand that, and it's not "bizarre" in the slightest. The concept of assigning rights proportionately is common. I suggested earlier that the woman has at least 51%, and the man up to 49% rights. But in this instance, that means the woman has "controlling" rights.

A woman is not a slave to her man, be she married or not. A woman is a completely separate individual - legally and otherwise.

That a man has contributed 50% OR LESS (remember the Y chromosome) in terms of GENETIC material, and that a man has contributed 0% (nadda) of the nutrients and other development materials clearly and without question makes the woman, as a free independent individual, more than 50% responsible for pre-natal development, and thus more than 50% in control of making the choice.

These facts are self evident. And your premise is one of the more specious ones, along with the "abortion industry is out to make a buck".

Very simply that about 40 million babies have been killed by abortion since 1973 and one or more of those babies could have grown up to accomplish any of those things.

 

Im sorry but this is just a completely ridiculous argument. Should we get the socio-economic breakdown of the aborted fetuses mothers and actually calculate the probability. If they are averaged out over the 30 years it is a paltry 1.3 million per year. Not even half a percent of the US population. I will not go through all the math but the likelihood of one these people even being a professional athlete is about 0. There are 4000 athletes at any given time in the four major sports and I am not even taking into account that many are not all from the US. So my calculations are generous.

There are a handful of Nobel prizes and similarly prestigious awards given each for the type of accomplishments you are hoping for. 1.3 million abortions as a percentage of the world population is.002%. That is a statistical accident at best. You can only argue that You never know though! Which, well, is not a valid argument.

You realize that there are MILLIONS of people ALIVE RIGHT NOW IN THE US that do not have the means to get basic nutrition and education. One of them might have discovered the solution to the abortion issue (would not we all be happy?), but we will never know. If I add in all the PEOPLE around the world that will never get a chance to discover your precious cures because of starvation and lack of education or whatever, NOW we will have a statistically significant number for you to use in your argument  OVER 3 BILLION PEOPLE. Now one of them may have what you are looking for  why do you not start with them?

Make the world a place worth living in and people will stop killing their children. Make more laws and oppress people with more government and they will always fight against you.

 
And you still haven't addressed my last post to you.

 

I will get to this soon. I am just a too busy. That is a long answer type of question.

 
Ps careful your unreasonable anger towards religious people is really showing in many of your postings....

This one is like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book. You can only pick one.

Answer 1) I did not realize the religious right was so sensitive. They sure can dish it out. I just assumed Jesus would protect them from the wicked mistruths that spilt off the tips of my forked tongue. Apple slices with peanut butter anyone?

Answer 2) God, particularly as viewed by the Judeo-Christian and Islamic cultures is simply a way to give importance to the believers lives. To know that the whole universe was put here for them and there exists some power greater than all we know that takes time to care about them  it is very self-aggrandizing. Without the formality of religion as assign importance to the believers lives what would they believe? It seems they are most likely incapable of forming an internal belief system or see the value in life itself. Like children raised in households with security monitors who never form an inner sense of right and wrong, because the fear of being caught is their only motive in life, these religious minions would lose their already misguided way and most likely destroy us all. So I find it difficult to care if they do not like me, as I am sure that it is only a reflection of how their god, which does not exist, has told them to feel.

Answer 3) Did I get angry with someone? I had not noticed. Please post the specific quote. I will try harder in the future to save my love of Catholicism, and complete and utter disgust for the other perverted forms of Gods word for time spent with my loving friends.

"Plurality" doesn't mean "more than one" - it means "more than not". It would be a stretch, for example to call 60 out of 100 a majority. Plurality would be the more appropriate term in that case.
 
 
 
Obviously "many" is subjective to a point. But I see protests with hundreds of fanatics, and to me, hundreds is certainly many.

Andy

 

Perhaps "fanatic" is an equally subjective term here. By what yardstick do you determine which of hundreds of protestors is a "fanatic"? Does disagreeing with you make one a "fanatic"?

WOAH.

There are times in a debate where both parties are so diametrically opposed at such a fundamental level that there is no hope of any form of reconciliation.

This is one of those times.

Dillo, I don't have the same values you do regarding things like this. I don't think of a woman or a wife as someone who is subservient to me.

If your wife is willing to go along, no problem. If she decides to make independent decisions that you disagree with, then I suppose you could get divorced. (Does this indicate the basis for the high divorce rate in "red" states?).

Please don't be so condescending as to lecture me regarding the time when things occur in a debate. I'm fully capable of reading and making my own determination as to the status of a discussion and free to continue it as long as the administrators of this site permit me to do so.

Your observation that we have different values was apparent several posts ago yet many of us here choose to continue discussing issues, if for nothing other than the typing practice.

I have no where in my discussion with you stated or implied that I believe women to be subservient to me and apparently this is where you fail to grasp the rationality of my point on this issue. I have consistently argued that both sexes should have equal rights to create, nurture, teach, love and let go of a child. You believe this right to be only a womans because of the way a human being is physically created. (You have also made several vain attempts to defend abortion because of the size of the fetus ).

You have failed to protect the rights of fathers in your attempt to defend a womans desire to have sex without facing the possible consequences such as pregnancy. You thus fail at protecting the possibilty of an embryonic life to become an independent one that has a man AND a woman to teach it.
Spare me the details of size, weeks, brain formation etc. for no one will ever know when life begins and more importantly, it is irrelevant to my stand against abortion.
Pro-abortion people know fully that the ONLY issue here is that women want to have sex without dealing with the consequences. They need to accept that they ARE women and are born with obligations, one of which is to carry human life until it can survive outside the womb. To take this responsibility so lightly and callously is to mock life itself.
Woman have choices.They can abstain,use birth control, put up for adoption or raise as their own.
Are they saying that they cannot be responsible for these choices or are they cursing their anatomy under thier breath?
I will ONLY believe that pro-abortion people truly believe what they say when they are willing to grant this right to fathers. Will they ?
NEVER
Why-------Because they don't want it to be a human right---only a womans OPTION.

.

You are missing the big picture, 36 million babies is a lot of dead babies period, and who said they would need to to win a nobel peace prize to be worthy of life??? Again your numbers cannot predict what people (if allowed to live) can accomplish, because number leaves out a whole range of occurances and other circumstances that contributes to the whole human being.

 
You realize that there are MILLIONS of people ALIVE RIGHT NOW IN THE US that do not have the means to get basic nutrition and education.

 

In this country just about everyone that is breathing has opportunities to make a living, even a good living, and no one is turned down for medical care. In case you haven't noticed we are a socialistic country and the tax payer foots the bill for those who are in need. And no one is turned away from school or education, every child is entitled by the government to a public education, the only caviot is they actually have to show up..........Cry me a river!!!!! Boo Hoo

 
If I add in all the PEOPLE around the world that will never get a chance to discover your precious cures because of starvation and lack of education or whatever

 

My precious cures??? What the hell does that mean?? You really have a problem!!!!

Make the world a place worth living in and people will stop killing their children. Make more laws and oppress people with more government and they will always fight against you.

 

This one takes the cake as a contender for most ignorant, and arrogant statement. This country is a pretty damn great country to live in and is in everyway worth living in. You must be talking about Ehtiopia. And if you want to get right to it, the Liberals in this country are the ones who censor people with political correctness, tell people they can't smoke, can't drive SUVs, they want bigger and bigger government, ridiculous restrictions on business, strict gun laws that keep anyone who wants to protect themselves and their families from having one, ridiculous environmental policies, want all forms of religion banished from the public forum, and on and on........And YOU have the balls to cry about about laws that oppress with more government..Get BENT you hypocrite!!!

 
Answer 1) I did not realize the religious right was so sensitive. They sure can dish it out. I just assumed Jesus would protect them from the wicked mistruths that spilt off the tips of my forked tongue. Apple slices with peanut butter anyone?

 

The so called religious right takes their lumps pretty good, and as far as I can tell have done nothing wrong to you. Again you really have a big problem!!!!

I think you misunderstand. "This is one of these times" refers to MY interest (or lack thereof) in continuing this discussion with you. Having cooled down a bit, and in seeing your response, I may have read into your response something more than you intended. We'll see in a moment.

 
Your observation that we have different values was apparent several posts ago yet many of us here choose to continue discussing issues, if for nothing other than the typing practice.

I have no where in my discussion with you stated or implied that I believe women to be subservient to me and apparently this is where you fail to grasp the rationality of my point on this issue.

 

I'm glad - really glad - that you made this statement. My post was a reaction to my apparent misinterpretation of:

 
...Why should I sit back and allow my wife to kill my child ??? I have more than 50% of the money and 50% of muscle. Guess i can use those to my advantage huh?

 

Now Dilloduck, I don't know you - In fact, it's unlikely we'll ever meet - so I don't know what kind of person you are outside of these forums. With only these forums to go on, it may be easy to misjudge character at times.

Your statement, particularly the "muscle" bit, struck me with a certain misogynistic tone. My immediate reaction caused me to dash off that post in response. (My meaning on the "This is that time" referred to me - my feeling that debating woman's rights with a misogynist would be pure folly - since I don't need the typing practice you mentioned.)

That was my thought and knee jerk response, though in reading your further reply I recognize that I misread your meaning.

You believe this right to be only a womans because of the way a human being is physically created. (You have also made several vain attempts to defend abortion because of the size of the fetus ).

 

I haven't got the "both sexes equal" in your arguments. Mostly I've seen your focus on granting additional right to men in the process.

 
You have failed to protect the rights of fathers in your attempt to defend a womans desire to have sex without facing the possible consequences such as pregnancy. You thus fail at protecting the possibilty of an embryonic life to become an independent one that has a man AND a woman to teach it.
Spare me the details of size, weeks, brain formation etc. for no one will ever know when life begins and more importantly, it is irrelevant to my stand against abortion.

 

Just so I'm clear then, what is relevant to your stand on abortion?

 
Pro-abortion people know fully that the ONLY issue here is that women want to have sex without dealing with the consequences.

 

1) No, that's not the only issue, and:

 
They need to accept that they ARE women and are born with obligations, one of which is to carry human life until it can survive outside the womb. To take this responsibility so lightly and callously is to mock life itself.

 

2) They have no such obligation. They have no obligation other than to themselves unless they accept that obligation.

 
Woman have choices.They can abstain,use birth control, put up for adoption or raise as their own.

 

And if the birth control does not work? Even condoms aren't fully effective.

 
Are they saying that they cannot be responsible for these choices or are they cursing their anatomy under thier breath?
I will ONLY believe that pro-abortion people truly believe what they say when they are willing to grant this right to fathers. Will they ?
NEVER
Why-------Because they don't want it to be a human right---only a womans OPTION.

 

What - WHAT - right do you want "granted" to fathers? The right to carry a child? It's not physically possible. The right to demand that their genetic seed be sewn?

This father/rights argument is specious at best. A male has no "right" to have his sperm join with an egg nor does he have the "right" to demand that a woman carry it full term. In fact, he does not have a right to raise the child under some circumstances, and the courts routinely deny parental rights to fathers in these cases.

If raising a child is a "right" it's a revokable one.

The point is, your "concept" of these "imaginary" rights has no basis in law or even culture - it may be tangental to the abortion issue, but not of much interest to me.

Regards,

Andy

Why doesn't it surprise me that you would declare a discussion over because YOU were no longer interested. Maybe you should not let your emotions cloud your ability to reason. I would think a communicator as yourself would know this already

Perhaps you merely have neglected to set your emotions and ego aside long enough to understand the truth in what I say. (btw--I'm from a blue county)

Again emotion and ego have overwhelmed your ability to reason and I obviously have to simplify the language that I use because you cannot grasp the analogies that I am attempting to make. More muscle on a man is a fact of nature but that doen't mean he has a right to abuse it but you feel as if a woman has the right to abuse her reproductive system. Save your arm chair diagnosis for you "column". Misogynist-?----Hardly--try again Dr. Freud.

nd if the birth control does not work? Even condoms aren't fully effective

 

.

I've already laid out the options that they have

 
What - WHAT - right do you want "granted" to fathers? The right to carry a child? It's not physically possible. The right to demand that their genetic seed be sewn?

This father/rights argument is specious at best. A male has no "right" to have his sperm join with an egg nor does he have the "right" to demand that a woman carry it full term. In fact, he does not have a right to raise the child under some circumstances, and the courts routinely deny parental rights to fathers in these cases.

 

Courts let murderers go too but it doesn't make it right !

 
The point is, your "concept" of these "imaginary" rights has no basis in law or even culture - it may be tangental to the abortion issue, but not of much interest to me

 

.

The right to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness is indeed a law. Pro- abortionist just want it to apply to only women in this case. The sole right to abort is not only imaginary but sexist.

An abortion is a selfish act carried out by women giving NO thought the fetus nor the father. It's discriminitory !!
 
 
 
FALSE. 80% of abortions take place in the FIRST trimester.

And plenty of terminations happen at the zygote level, but they are not called abortions (result of morning after pill) and thus don't make it into the statistic.

Andy

 

Um, 40 days is still in the first trimester CL. Don't be deliberately obtuse.

There are two different morning after pills, one that prevents the creation of the zygote at all and one that gives almost 100% chance of abortion if a zygote is created, but this is clearly not what I was talking about, I guess I should have said over 99% of surgical abortions occur after 40 days after conception. Since we are now speaking of surgical abortions and most people don't even know they are pregnant to make the choice to abort until after 40 days into a Pregnancy it is clear that almost all abortions occur 40 or more days after conception. At that point a Fetus has brain activity and a heartbeat. Thus a central nervous system and "alive" by your previous declared position of brain activy = life.

Since you have stated earlier that brain activity is where you make the cut are you willing to propose that we should stop over 99% of surgical abortions or are you going to attempt to change your position in midstream?
 
 
Below is a summation of the 14th amendment under which the Supreme Court effectively legalized aboortion.

The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. See U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In other words, the laws of a state must treat an individual in the same manner as others in similar conditions and circumstances. A violation would occur, for example, if a state prohibited an individual from entering into an employment contract because he or she was a member of a particular race. The equal protection clause is not intended to provide "equality" among individuals or classes but only "equal application" of the laws. The result, therefore, of a law is not relevant so long as there is no discrimination in its application. By denying states the ability to discriminate, the equal protection clause of the Constitution is crucial to the protection of civil rights.

Prior to this decision there was no right to have an abortion for ANYONE and a law DID exist that made abortion illegal. Since the laws of nature make it impossible for a man to have an abortion, this law was seen as discriminitory towards women and ruled unconstitutional.

What the judges failed to take into consideration was that when 2 people enter a contract to have sex that equal application of the law should be extended to the mother AND the father and it is on THIS issue is where Roe v Wade should be overturned.

Forget argueing when life begins ! We can't even figure out when humans began and it only serves to confuse the issue. Forget the biology and size of the matter to be aborted for the very same reason! Women only have to right to abort because judges wrongly interpreted the 14th amendment by neglecting to extend equal APPLICATION of the law to men AS WELL AS women.

Men have limitations on what they can do with the body they were born with yet these judges seem to feel as if women shouldn't. Are men to be subjected to the arbitrary decision of a woman in order to be a father? This certainly flies in the face of mans' right to pursue happines. If a woman chooses to abort to be happy then perhaps men should have this right too instead of parenting being forced on them by the whims of a woman. Paying to support a child that the father often never gets to see is certainly an inconvenience caused ONLY by his phyical make-up.

The right to be a parent, while not specifically delineated in the constitution, can certainly argued to be God given and inalienable as it is only through a combination of male and female matter that birth OR abortion is even possible.
The fact that the fetus is nurtured in the womans womb is not by her choice but by the design of nature and men must live by this law of nature as well.

The right of women to exclusively have an abortion on demand as granted by the Supreme Court DISCRIMINATES against a mans' right to do the very same thing to the very same matter at question.

Again I ask you, would pro-abortion people be willing to extend the right of choice to a man if they believe so firmly that all people should have equal rights? The answer is a resounding NO with the reasoning being only that the "matter" is growing inside of the woman by natures' design. Murder for the sake of convenience apparently is a right that women feel is EXCLUSIVELY theirs'. Discrimination is OK if nature made you differently?
See if you can sell that one to all those who are created "differently" !

The Supreme Court created a situation where a law is applied in a discriminatory fashion. If both sexes are not allowed the right to decide on parenthood than NIETHER should have it !
 
 
 
Why doesn't it surprise me that you would declare a discussion over because YOU were no longer interested. Maybe you should not let your emotions cloud your ability to reason. I would think a communicator as yourself would know this already

 

I've made my points and you've made yours. I've pointed out the faults in your logic, but now we're repeating ourselves.

 
Perhaps you merely have neglected to set your emotions and ego aside long enough to understand the truth in what I say. (btw--I'm from a blue county)

 

I am still human and suffer the faults of emotional reactions like everyone else. I did clarify after the fact.

 
not additional--EQUAL

That both sexes should have equal rights

 

They have equal rights. They each have control over their own bodies. Giving a man control over the woman's body would be to give him ADDITIONAL rights.

 
I've already laid out the options that they have

 

And who are you to dictate their options?

 
Courts let murderers go too but it doesn't make it right !

 

Our court system, though it has flaws, works pretty well. What alternate system do you propose?

I'm not being obtuse, you stated that most abortions occurred in the second trimester, which is false. 80% happen in the first trimester.

It's not a fetus till the third month, and even then the brain stem is primitive at best. the brain centers that control even the most basic life functions such as breathing don't develop until the 6th month.

At the 4th month, the fetal brain is about the size of a hazelnut - smaller than that of a cat, and far less developed. This primitive brain has not developed into an individual person, nor has it developed the nervous centers needed for sustaining life.

 
Since you have stated earlier that brain activity is where you make the cut are you willing to propose that we should stop over 99% of surgical abortions or are you going to attempt to change your position in midstream?

 

I never made the statement that "brain activity" is where I make the distinction - if anything I said brain development. There is a very significant difference.

And again, 80% of surgical abortions happen in the FIRST trimester, which means the FIRST 3 months.

I said nothing of the sort. I said that most surgical abortions occured after 40 days. Earlier you said brain function was your cut-off point and I simply pointed out that brain function begins at 40 days and therefore by your definition it was human life. Now you are defining it as functional central nervous system.

When asked when human life begins you stated "A few undifferentiated cells with no brain stem? Not a human being." This led me to believe that you assert that when the embryo developed a brain stem, ergo brain activity, they were in your estimation human.

And as I pointed out 40 days is certainly the FIRST Trimester and therefore my statement was not FALSE as you asserted, therefore in my estimation you are deliberately changing my statement from something that was not false into something that is false in an attempt to deny my point which is certainly a logical fallacy if not obtuse.

What if I interpret the equal rights part of this argument as THE SEX? Both the man and the woman have the right to participate in the actual sex that results in conception. Before the sex, both parties can negotiate anything they want and both make a decision whether or not to participate. They are treated fully equally.

After that the 'right' to carry a fetus to term and bear a child is uniquely female. That 'right' cannot be negotiated. The state can respect a man's 'right' to want to bear children, but he cannot - it is biological. Your rights (about delivering a child or abortion or whatever might follow) stop when the sex begins. Why? It is not your 'right' to have sex. That is why you negotiated before the act.

Example - It is usually obligatory for a football stadium to have seating for physically challenged people, as to not discriminate against who can buy their product. One cannot sit there if one is not physically challenged. When you purchase your tickets you know this to be true, before the fact, and make a decision if this is 'fair' before you buy. The seats are there and you cannot have them, ever.

Maybe you should start by thinking about this simpler and most likely less controversial example.

Just a thought.

I would if I thought being a woman was some sort of handicap as some would have us believe ! Poor things would have to be pregnant for a whole 9 months if abortion was illegal. They shouldn't have to go through all that because of a silly little mistake !

I wanted a cite on your contention that ROE was based on the 14th, and your interpretation of ROE as stated in that post.

This disabled thing has gone too far - yes, such seats should be available, but if they are not purchased by disabled by the time the game starts, then they should be open to anyone.

You're right, they shouldn't.

A woman should not be forced to carry for 9 months if she decides against it, and terminates in the first 3 months, as provided by law.

well then, she shouldn't take a chance on pregnancy, if that is not what she wants. D'oh! Don't post bs about condoms. IF she has the final SAY, then she should make sure pregnancy does not occur. R*E*S*P*E*C*T as the song goes....

Let me get this straight--Males can negotiate to have sex with a woman but cannot negotiate to share the rights to what may be created by this union? How about a no-fault clause for the man to be free from any consequences of this sexual encounter ? Bet that goes over like a lead balloon. Why are so many people willing to cede the future of our society, country and race to the female gender ?

It gets down to this--a woman has been granted more freedom because she has the right body parts ??? Being hit in the balls is a hate crime that can only be committed by a woman??? Nonsense.

You and I seem to agree mostly on these points. Radical idea: Neither man nor woman should get in position of conceiving a child, if they don't want to take responsibility for such.

If you don't feel comfortable discussing, well guess you shouldn't get naked.

The problem is no one forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place. She puts herself in the position to get pregnant. As much as people like to pretend, you cant change the consquences of poor choices. And you deffinately shouldnt be allowed to terminate a life because you want to get out of a tough situation you put yourself in because of poor actions.

The American people have never passed a law allowing Abortion. Legal Abortion is the creation of the Supreme Court. Roe v. Wade needs to be overturned so the people can create their own laws not Judges.

Yes and no  just not after the fact. This seems pretty clear  as a part of your negotiation you could get married, for example. This would increase your bargaining power with the woman who you are negotiating to have sex with. I imagine there are cases where a women being deemed not of sound mind, has been forced by the state to have a child that the father wants to have. I am assuming she was pregnant before she went crazy. I imagine you could also have a very elaborate pre-nuptial agreement limiting or increasing your responsibility to any embryos conceived, etc. I am not suggesting these negotiations take place in a frat house basement 15 minutes before you get lucky. I am only saying the negotiations are possible.

You could simply negotiate to not participate in any activities that would lead to conception. That seems pretty easy.

 
It gets down to this--a woman has been granted more freedom because she has the right body parts ??? Being hit in the balls is a hate crime that can only be committed by a woman??? Nonsense.

 

I am still thinking about this one. The answer could very well be  yes, the world is unfair.

That may be a good idea - For instance, if the man wants the woman to get an abortion, and she does not wish too, why not let the man waive his rights over the offspring? Just like a sperm donor does.

I'm not so sure.

Say a man has sex with his girlfriend, with little thought of the consequences. The girlrfiend gets pregnant. She happens to be morally opposed to killing babies and does not want to have an abortion. The man does not particularly care and just wants the fetus dead so they can forget about it and get back to more sex. I don't think it's fair that the man could just walk out and leave after that.
 
 
 
Answer 2) God, particularly as viewed by the Judeo-Christian and Islamic cultures is simply a way to give importance to the believers lives. To know that the whole universe was put here for them and there exists some power greater than all we know that takes time to care about them  it is very self-aggrandizing. Without the formality of religion as assign importance to the believers lives what would they believe? It seems they are most likely incapable of forming an internal belief system or see the value in life itself. Like children raised in households with security monitors who never form an inner sense of right and wrong, because the fear of being caught is their only motive in life, these religious minions would lose their already misguided way and most likely destroy us all. So I find it difficult to care if they do not like me, as I am sure that it is only a reflection of how their god, which does not exist, has told them to feel.

 

I find it amusing...one who supports the killing of unborn children for convience, lecturing those gosh darn religious minions on the value of life.

You are obviously a very sad and bitter person, and you have my pity.

Did you get raped by a priest in your youth?

and if she gets a STD she can't hold the man responsible and should she choose to allow the child the live, she takes full financial and emotional responsibilty for raising it. Child support becomes a thing of the past.

First, you are quoting me very selectively at an attempt to make a point. You should read the whole thread and you would see that in the quote you selected I was being facetious. I was proposing a possible argument.

Second, I have not stated I think abortion is right or wrong. Nor have I told anyone else how they should value life. I have said on more than one occasion that I agree that life starts at conception, but I that I personally do not value that potential human as much as a already born human. I value different people differently. I do not have a problem with capital punishment for example either. I can just look at abortion as capital punishment for people who are conceived inside the morally inferior. Why wait for them to grow up to punish them? They clearly will be raised to have the morals of a serial killer.

Finally, pity is for the weak. The libs like to give it out to make themselves feel better after they lose elections or anytime after they open their stupid mouths for that matter. The fact that you can even feel pity confirms that you are a sissy-spined lib. You should save your pity for your family, friends and co-workers who have the regular misfortune of being close enough to hear the inane dribble that comes from your mouth. I can just not read your posts.
 
 
 
to dilloduck

 

We are talking about a pre-coital agreement, correct. I think some of the other posters have a problem with this arrangement only because it sounds like it gives men the right, at any time, to change their mind. I am ok with this type of agreement as long as it is made clear up front and both parties agree.

The problem from what little I know about the law is this:

If I sign or passively agree to a liability waiver to not hold a second party responsible for some dangerous activity in which they are allowing or assisting me to participate  paintball (I have to sign a form), seeing a hockey game (the agreement occurs when the money changes hands  waiver is on the back of the ticket), eating rare beef (they now put warnings on the bottom of the menus). That waiver often does not stand up in court. It can actually be used against the second party, because it says the activity is dangerous and the second party is fully aware it is dangerous.

I still think it is a good idea; I just do not want to be the test case.

It depends very much on the state, and with "dangerous instrumentations" it generally falls under a "duty to warn" which the liability waiver does fulfill. That still leaves "vicarious" liability, which in California is limited to $10,000.

I agree with the concept, I just think it would be difficult for the man to prove the condom was used to artificially inseminate her after having sex with her. She could claim it broke or that he didn't use one. Evidence would be difficult to come by and the man would end up having to pay unless he had some way to simply say that he does not agree to having responsibility over a life he did not consent to create.

Why is it that when somebody signs a contract they are no longer held to their promise.

I mean damn, there was a time if you SAID something you were held to your promise. Now you get lawyers, write binding contracts, and you are STILL NOT HELD TO YOUR PROMISE!

It is starting to get really annoying. Why even sign contracts if nobody is ever held to what they signed.
 
 
Here's some legal information I've found so far:

 
AP - A state appeals court ruled that a verbal agreement between a woman and her sperm donor was invalid, and ordered the man to pay child support for the woman's twins.

 

 www.drudgereport.com 

 
When single women receive sperm from donors who are not anonymous, the legal implications are numerous and the protections few, as was demonstrated in a case that sparked heated debate. This case involved a lesbian couple that enlisted the assistance of a sperm donor when they decided to start a family. The donor agreed that while he would have no parental rights or obligations, he would meet the child if she ever became curious about her biological origins. The donor met the child on several occasions under terms strictly dictated by the couple. When the couple refused one of the donor's visitation requests, the donor instituted a paternity proceeding. The trial court refused the donor's request based on the equitable estoppel doctrine and the best interests of the child. The sperm donor prevailed, however, on appeal. The appellate court ruled that the donor was the child's biological father and as such he had parental rights that could not be terminated without a formal proceeding.

Although N.C.G.S. § 49A-1 says the child of a married couple who is conceived by artificial insemination is treated the same as any other child, there are no statutes that deal with the situation of an unmarried couple. For this reason, anyone considering the option of bearing a child through alternative insemination or donating sperm should consult a competent lawyer before proceeding, except in cases of anonymous sperm donation at a licensed medical facility.

A sperm donor may become obligated to support the child and may be granted visitation rights even if the parties enter an agreement to the contrary. Paternity tests approved by North Carolina courts are almost 100% accurate, so anonymity and the use of multiple donors provide little protection to either the sperm donor or the mother.

So thats just a bit right of the bat...it looks like if you don't make damn sure that a) you are married and b) you have taken every legal precaution possible....the courts can make any sort of odd determination.
 
 
 
Why is it that when somebody signs a contract they are no longer held to their promise.

I mean damn, there was a time if you SAID something you were held to your promise. Now you get lawyers, write binding contracts, and you are STILL NOT HELD TO YOUR PROMISE!

It is starting to get really annoying. Why even sign contracts if nobody is ever held to what they signed.

 

Its because some contracts are just unenforceable. like if someone promises to do some sort of service the court of equity cant force a person to do that labor. When there is a way to monetarily compensate the person for the breach its the court will allow compensation at law. Its rather annoying really. with that said im off to contracts class.
 
 
 
well CL? comments ???

 

Well, hmm. They had planned on offspring, so that implies concent. They were married, and he was brain dead, which as far I'm concerned means dead.

Do dead people have rights? Not usually.

I'll look for information on the actual case...but I'm almost certain that there IS legal precedent of one-time sperm donors demanding and being granted by the courts visitation rights for the offspring of his "offering," so to speak.

 

It varies on a state by state basis.

And there are "willing to be known" donors, wherein there is to be a single meeting when the child turns 18.

Finally, pity is for the weak. The libs like to give it out to make themselves feel better after they lose elections or anytime after they open their stupid mouths for that matter. The fact that you can even feel pity confirms that you are a sissy-spined lib. You should save your pity for your family, friends and co-workers who have the regular misfortune of being close enough to hear the inane dribble that comes from your mouth. I can just not read your posts.

Comatose or brain dead?

If brain dead, and you keep the woman ON support until she delivers, that's no different than harvesting the DNA from the brain dead man.

If you take the woman OFF life support, then she dies, and in dying so does the embryo or fetus.

This obvious truth makes it clear that the embryo or fetus is just a part of the woman, and not a separate being.

Incorrect analogy. If the baby had been born and the woman died when the baby was three days old then without help from other people, just like the offspring in the womb, the baby would die. Does this mean that a child born is still part of the woman? The offspring in the womb is dependant on the woman but is not part of the woman, just as they will be after birth.

Speaking of obtuse! Your analogy is fundamentally flawed.

While the child is inside the woman, it is sharing her life functions. After it is born, it is not - anyone else can take care of it.

It is not fundamentally flawed, it is simply a different level of dependancy. Attempting to define a whole different life with separate DNA, its own heartbeat, its own immune system that is simply dependant on another to live and saying that they are one in the same is flawed beyond repair.

Obtuse is taking one statement "Most surgical abortions occur after 40 days" (40 days is in the first Trimester) and turning it into "Most abortions occur after the second Trimester" (Which I NEVER stated) then attempting to use the statement in an argument EVEN AFTER YOU WERE CORRECTED.

Except in my analogy I stated that if nobody else cared for the child and thereby clearly understood the different level of dependancy.

It is simply showing the difference between dependancy vs. being the same person. The offspring is not the same as the mother even while in utero.

And while the offspring is dependent on more from the mother while in the womb it is simply a different level of dependancy for a different person, if the pregnancy is 20 weeks along with help from doctors they could likely keep the child alive outside the womb.

If the woman was pregnant when she went brain dead and her body is kept alive the baby would live as a separate entity because of the help of other people. Those doctors that kept bodily functions going simply helped the baby the same way somebody else would help the ex utero offspring. A different level of help for a different level of dependancy.

medical science has kept baby's alive that are born as many as 6 months prior to term...and mom's that are kept alive by machines so they can give birth...so that would be a lead zeplin argument you have there
 
 
Andy,

You're sinking like a stone here, I have to assume you're smart enough to be aware of it.

You wrote:

Firstly, we are not speaking of any of the bad anti-abortion arguments out there. There are many, of course, as there are with any heated topic. However, to excuse your own bad arguments by saying "well the other side has bad arguments too" is juvenille. You're argument is poor, admit it and move on, rather than pointing fingers at other people...their bad arguments don't excuse yours...especially since you seem insistent on clinging to it.

To continue, the fetus does not "share life functions" with its mother...it lives within its mother, a seperate life, that is dependent upon its mother for providing nutrition and environment. The baby at a very early stage has its own heartbeat, its own bloodflow, its own brain functions...it moves without its mother moving, sleeps when its mother is awake, produces waste and gets rid of it without the mother doing the same...its an organism feeding off of the nutrients its host provides, living in the habitable environment the hosts body provides, but it is certainly not the same as the host.

Additionally, unlike a tumor, a cyst, a polyp, a knot of lactic acid, etc. a baby (or fetus if it makes you more comfortable) can not be created by the woman's body alone. No matter how hard she tries, no matter what drugs she takes, foods she eats, pills she ingests, etc. etc. she can not MAKE a baby without the help of another person (whether he be present during conception or whether he simply donates the needed portion of himself). A woman cannot produce the fetus/baby growing within her by herself, it requires the combonation of two people to make a completely unique and seperate third. That third is in NO WAY, just an extention, like an extra organ, of the woman. Sorry...no matter how hard you wish it, its just not going to make it so.

Sigh, Andy...its a terrible argument...I'll continue to argue with it if you wish, but considering that medical science and simple, provable, biological fact (i.e. a fetus's genetic composition and actions working completely seperate from its mothers) have proven you wrong...I really think it would be better if we just moved on.

A challenge for you: You obviously feel very strongly about supporting a woman's right to abortion...tell me why without arguing that a baby is not a person with less rights than another person because they aren't as developed.
 
 
i think the argument is...that a women should be able to do with her body as she sees fit...men have made the rules about everything long enough...women get to decide this one...and women get to live with their decsion...i really don't think this is a government issue...but what the f do i know i have an outty not an inny
 
 
 
At what precise moment does human life begin?

 

I haven't read all of the many posts so I don't know if it has been mentioned but I wonder, when does the measurable electrical charge that is in all of us when we are alive and disappears when we die, enter the fetus? I guess this charge is what many consider the soul. I have seen a few people that were dead and a number of animals, it seems more noticeable in humans. I guess that could also be the lack of blood pumping through the body but a person definitely looks different a moment after they die. When does the soul enter the body according to different religions ?

That's a damn good question, sitarro. My honest answer is that I don't know - and I'll go out on a limb and say no one else knows either. Since no one really knows - and since the stakes are as high as stakes get (life and death), wouldn't it just be common sense - common decency - to err on the side of caution - the side of life?

That's the point I've been trying to make. That's why I've asked Civil Liberty that same question like half a dozen times in this thread alone. And, that's the reason he hasn't answered me - he's basically full of shit.

I agree Musicman,
It is the year 2005, the variety of protection from accidental pregnancy is a great deal larger than the days when I was a kid. The diseases are a lot more deadly now too, there seems to be more reasons than ever to wait.
I have never seen any research having to do with the electrical charge in a fetus ever, it would be interesting to find that out. With the advances in photography within the womb there really is no doubt that what we see is a little human being that even shows emotions. The color 3D shots are amazing, I don't see how anyone could murder what I have seen in those pictures, and I don't and probably never will have any kids. I do have some great nieces and nephews that I wouldn't want to do without.
I do wish that parents would be better about taking the responsibility to teach their kids about sex, and early. My girlfriend and I had lost our virginity a year before my Dad sort of got around to talking about it with me. I remember the horror of discovering first hand what effects vasoline had on condoms. :eek2: :cry:

Yes! And most importantly being a "civilized" (term used loosley) society we are supposed to on a very basic primal level protect all living things especially human living things.

Im amazed at the lengths people will go to protect trees in the Rainforest, or forests in logging towns, and at the same time treat babies like discarded socks............

Manu, while I respect your opinion that this is a realm that should be left up to women, I wonder if the pro-abortion women in the US would agree with you.

Watching the news the other day, during the "birthday" of Roe v. Wade, the reporter stated that the latest polls show that while the "pro-choice v. pro-life" argument is split about 50/50...that when one examines the numbers more carefully, they see that almost 95% of people favor much stricter restrictions on abortions such as 1) none past the first trimester, 2) only in the cases of rape, incest, and life of mother

Would you still support what the ladies want if the ladies voted to restrict abortion to only cases of the life of the mother? Would the pro-choice movement agree to such an arrangement? Could we vote on it and then let what happens be the end of it in the political arena?

i belive that women should decide..... not the government... the fact is neither side will ever agree... there will always be a group that says no abortion for any reason... and another group that says my body my choice... at the moment the gov't says nothing after the first trimester except in the case of sepcial cirumstance... the whole thing is a no win for half the people
 
 
 
and another group that says my body my choice... at the moment the gov't says nothing after the first trimester except in the case of sepcial cirumstance... the whole thing is a no win for half the people

 

And definitely a no win for babies that get sucked out of the wombs of that half that feels it is their right to take no responsibility for their actions. And for that lack of responsibility they get to live with the fact for the rest of their life that they murdered their own child. No amount of justification helps in the end if they have any heart at all. I have watched women I know cry everyday over putting their child up for adoption, and I have seen them wallow in an alcoholic state for years over regrets from abortions. There are no easy solutions, if you are going to have sex, you take the chance of heartache, disease, unwanted pregnancy or all of these together... it is not something to take lightly.

Robert Casey
"In short, our response as a party should be to work to solve the crisis that produces crisis pregnancies, and work to make life worth living for mother and child, rather than victimize the child as a way of dealing with this crisis. I am convinced this approach, a mainstream Democratic approach, commands the strong support of the American people, and presents a sharp and compassionate solution".

Mike Cummings
"that is the real mission of liberalism: to provide for and to protect the least and most defenseless of God's creatures, not eliminate them."

Carl Estabrook
If the Left continues to draw out the implication of it's principals, it will discover the marginalization of the unborn and unwanted as for example it discovered the marginalization of women in the first and second waves of feminism in the 19th and 20th centuries. and it's reasonalbe to suspect that the discovery will take as long and involves as many contradictions as that concerning women did--and does." from Abortion and the Left

Tony Hall
"The moral test of government, Hubert Humphrey said, is how that government treats those that are in the dwan of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick." Speech before the 1996 Democratic National Convention.

Kevin Kelly
"I think considering the fetus a human being would keep our definitions of "human' wide. We would be less likely to narrow our acceptance of who is human, to cast away those not formed like us. As it is, we find it particularly tempting to eliminate those who don't meet our specifications (white, extra bright, no defects) while they are voiceless and unseen, whereas once they are born we are obliged to accept and adapt to their otherness. Imagine a world where the mishapened were not permitted to live, where everyone was "normal.' That's the opposite of a place where the fetus is treated as a human being."

Marilyn Dickstein Kopp
"Like the death penalty and military aggression, abortion reflects society's tendency to solve problems by disposing of those who present problems. Giving voice to the voiceless--not exerting lethal control over them--always has been a priority of the left." Opinion piece from a Pro-Life Feminist.

Mary Meehan
"The abortion issue, more than most, illustrates the occasional tendency of the left to become so enthusiastic over what is called a "reform" that it forgets to think the issue through. It is ironic that so many on the left have done on abortion what the conservatives and Cold War liberals did on Vietnam: They marched off in the wrong direction, to fight the wrong war, agianst the wrong people." From Abortion: The Left has betrayed the sanctity of life.

Now some from the pro-choice side:

:"You say kids should be allowed to be born to a bad environment, does that mean a woman can have one just to torture it? If I was forced to have one i would i would not be nice to it, maybe put it to bed with a plasctic bag and hpoe for the best or throw it in a trash can or maybe usr it use it as a pinata. but that would be much kinder than an abortion, huh"
Casey NJ spider-wd041.proxy.aol.com

Andy,
To continue, the fetus does not "share life functions" with its mother...it lives within its mother, a seperate life, that is dependent upon its mother for providing nutrition and environment.

 

It shares the mothers life functions through the placenta. The mother is responsible both for oxygenating the blood and providing protein and carbohydrates, as well as eliminating the waste of the embryo. The mother is responsible for regulating the embryonic hormones though the placenta.

The embryo/fetus places significant new load on the woman's life functions because it is sharing them through the placenta.

 
The baby at a very early stage has its own heartbeat, its own bloodflow, its own brain functions...it moves without its mother moving, sleeps when its mother is awake, produces waste and gets rid of it without the mother doing the same...its an organism feeding off of the nutrients its host provides, living in the habitable environment the hosts body provides, but it is certainly not the same as the host.

When someone demonstrated how early on a baby/fetus/blob of tissue had brain waves, and how we keep humans alive out of respect for their life even when their brain functions are less than that of an unborn child...it wasn't about brainwaves it was about viability...then it went back to size...then an enigmatic discussion of personhood...then you started on the ridiculous notion that because a baby/fetus/blob of tissue is sustained in the womb feeding off of its mother from the umbilical cord (inside) rather than the breast (outside) it was PART OF THE MOTHER, rather than a seperate being living off of the sustinence of its host...then when that point was shown to be ludicrous all of a sudden you are denying that you ever said that.

At this point, I am trying to decide whether you are strongly pro-choice, but aren't used to having to defend your position yet...or if you're just here to amuse yourself by making stupid arguments, laughing at people trying to debate them with you, and then pretending that you never made the arguments because its amusing to watch us deal with that.

If the latter is your goal, bravo...you've managed to stump me...I have absolutely no idea what you're trying to accomplish by consistently making then denying your own points...if you truly are trying to explain yourself, however...keep working on it, you're interesting to read, but your points could use some work (and would probably be helped immensely by you not sabotauging them!)
 
 
hey gem,

Hi....pro life or pro choice?

care to discuss? you had good comments the other day
 
 
Gem:

I'm glad we're pretty generally in agreement - I'd hate like hell to have to tangle with you!
 
 
Musicman,

Aw, I'm harmless. Actually, my husband scolds me occasionally for my tone on message boards, which always seems to come off as more condescending as I mean it to be. In person, I'm very sarcastic, but very nice...and I think in written form my sarcasm looks meaner than I really am. However, the things I write are the things I would say, so while I occassionally try to tone down things that could be misunderstood as condescention...usually I just say, "Hey, its a messageboard...I hope that they understand, but I'm not going to try to candy-coat everything." (That sounded condescending again, didn't it?!?!)  

Manu,

I'm both really. I don't think the answer is forbiding abortions altogether, nor do I think the answer is abortions-on-demand.
 
 
Gem:

Oh, I don't find you condescending at all. It's just that you seem to come pretty well-armed. Glad you're one of the good guys!
 
 
 
Thus far pro-choice groups are happy to just kill babies because it is legal--it is yet to be determined how they would react if they didn't get their way.

 

Pro choice groups don't kill babies. Doctors terminate pregnancies which involves embryos or fetuses and not involve babies. A baby is only a baby after it is born.

I think you're twisting my words out of context, but as I stated several times in several threads in the past, I happen to frequent this forum because it provides such a wide variety of highly conservative viewpoints.

If I post something on a progressive or libertarian oriented forum, I'll just hear a bunch of "I agree" comments. Posting here, I get a number of comments/challenges that I wouldn't hear otherwise, and that's very helpful to me as a writer.

I'll post my abortion article when I'm through.

Andy

Joseph Goebells couldn't come up with a better line than that gem of yours.

How convenient, how clean. You're just getting rid of a lump of tissue, just as if you're having a wart removed.

Sounds like....

"The Nazi party isn't killing Jews. We are just arriving at a final solution that involves those of subhuman races and does not involve people."

"The South doesn't enslave humans. We are just growing cotton using our property, these are not people, but slaves. See... the Supreme Court says so!"

"The Taliban doesn't deny people their rights. We are just arriving at a theocracy by keeping sinners in line. Women aren't people, only men are."

That tempo reminds me of another oft quoted slogan:

"Guns don't kill people, people kill people."

or another version I like is:

"Guns don't kill people, the bullet I fired at that m*therf*cker who tried to break into my house did."

But your version of this is slightly modified to read:

"Foreceps don't crush the skull cavity of a living human being, doctors who were legally hired by the mother to terminate her child and put it into a baggie labeled 'Medical Waste' do."

 
 
 
 
Liar. I pointed out that 80 percent of abortions happen in the FIRST trimester.

You claimed that "almost all abortions take place in the second trimester".

D'oh! I didn't remember that statement because it is not one that I actually believe and it was most definitely a statement in error and for that I apologize. I wasn't lying I just honestly didn't believe I would make such a statement as I know that it isn't true and therefore actually typed something that was incorrect in error not in actual attempt to make it true.

However it doesn't change the main question.

You made the statement, "No Brain = Not a Human Being."

 http://www.usmessageboard.com/forums...&postcount=162 

Therefore I posit the question. Brain activity begins at 40 days, and most surgical abortions happen after 40 days. Since we have brain activity then we must have a Human Being as per your original posit in the post shown above do you find it necessary to rethink your position and try to redifine it, or do you agree we should limit surgical abortion to before the moment of brain activity?

We have seen you attempt to redifine the position, restate it, and categorically deny that you ever made the posit, so I think we know what you are going to do. Attempt to change and redifine your argument to match what you actually want, abortions to continue regardless....
 
 
 
I'm not being obtuse, you stated that most abortions occurred in the second trimester, which is false. 80% happen in the first trimester.

It's not a fetus till the third month, and even then the brain stem is primitive at best. the brain centers that control even the most basic life functions such as breathing don't develop until the 6th month.

At the 4th month, the fetal brain is about the size of a hazelnut - smaller than that of a cat, and far less developed. This primitive brain has not developed into an individual person, nor has it developed the nervous centers needed for sustaining life.

I never made the statement that "brain activity" is where I make the distinction - if anything I said brain development. There is a very significant difference.

And again, 80% of surgical abortions happen in the FIRST trimester, which means the FIRST 3 months.

Andy

 

Now you are lying, you said "No Brain = Not a human being"

 http://www.usmessageboard.com/forums...&postcount=162 

Thus when brain activity starts at 40 days we now have a human being according to your definition. And since most abortions occur after 40 days we have a question as to your position. You make one statement in the post provided, then you attempt to make a different position later and therefore are being dishonest to either yourself or us or have made a posit in error as well.

Once again I apologize, I never tried to defend the second trimester because I don't believe it, know it is incorrect, and was shocked to discover that I actually did type it but I posted it in error. What I was meaning to say is that most surgical abortions occur after 40 days when brain activity can be recorded in the fetus.
 
 
 
Now you are lying, you said "No Brain = Not a human being"

 

I'm not lying, I know I said that. It is not, however a limiting factor in my argument.

My point is that before even the most primitive brain stem forms, it's ludicrous to call that a human being.

The statement "No Brain = Not a human being" holds true without question.

But that does not mean or imply that adding just a primitive brain stem makes it a human being then, either.

While primitive brain waves might start at 40 days, this does not mean that it suddenly becomes a human being.

A mouse has brain waves, too, and that does not make it a human.

No, my definition is that without a brain, there is no human, that does not mean that adding some brain elements makes it a human. That's a logical leap.

Okay, statement clarified. However, I don't consider mere brain "activity" as the signature of the human being. It is BRAIN DEVELOPMENT.

I point this out clearly in my article, which I am going to post here asa new thread.

what would you like to call a human sperm that combines with a human egg that can only become a human....

once the egg and sperm combine and you abort it on purpose you are murdering a future human being....no way around it

Which answered the question of whether you would change that statement from what it began as to something else in order to continue in the argument or whether you would admit that by that statement we could define brain activity as when human life started and therefore outlaw over 99% of surgical abortions.

However I do understand that clarifying your position isn't really changing it but it was beginning to be heated. However I still define a developing human as human at any stage of life regardless of how far the development has gone and know that my position is not "ludicrous" as you keep repeating. Attempting to get us to believe that it is "ludicrous" to have an opinion such as mine without respect to the opinion is also a logical fallacy called either Argument by Repetition or Argument Ad Nauseam.

In this we obviously cannot meet and therefore I reiterate my position from before that could possibly make both sides meet at least in function if not in beliefs.
 
 
 
Not sure what this proves Bonnie. It is the radical anti-abortionists that are torching clinics and murdering doctors.

Can you cite from pro-choice groups that have gone out and burned churches and murdered reverends in the name of choice?

Regards,

Andy

 

Sure bombing an abortion clinic happened in an extremely rare case and that's not what I was referring to in my post and you know it. Yet you keep harkening back to that, to make your case that many pro-life advoates are extremeists and your arguement doesn't hold water, because when you compare actions, rederic, and arguments, pro-lifers come out on top hands down.

I would imagine it has mouse brain waves and not human brain waves unless of course his name was Micky

The thing is, even without brain waves the developing human is simply that, a developing human. This attempt to define it as any other thing is simply illogical and an attempt to redefine human in order to make people feel better about aborting offspring.
 
 
 
Pro choice groups don't kill babies. Doctors terminate pregnancies which involves embryos or fetuses and not involve babies. A baby is only a baby after it is born.

At least get your scientific terminology correct.

The terms "fetus" and preborn are the same. The fetus becomes a "neonate" when born. Fetus is a medical/scientific term for a preborn baby. Neonate is the equvalent term for a newborn baby.

At birth, the preborn child becomes a newborn child. At virth, the fetus becomes a neonate, both are the same only one is in English, the other in scientific lingo.

So the baby that is destined to be killed is a "fetus" and the fetus that is destined to be born is "a baby"?

How about the word "viable" defined as capable of living; especially born alive with such form and development of organs as to be normally capable of living (Websters Seventh ed) So if we use the more liberal terminology "capable of living" then a preborn baby is "viable". So in fact the preborn baby prior to it's 20 week gestation period, loses it's viability only when forcibly removed from it's mothers womb, nature will only abort a truly non viable preborn.

So the mother's womb is the natural environment for a human being in his or her first nine months of life and development. If a land mammal were then put into water it would not be "viable", and If a fish were put on fry land, it would not be viable..........so as a classification, human beings are nonviable relative to the environment outside the uterus, but only for the first five months of life, so for the young preborn, viability is lost ONLY after an abortion; if the proceedure itself does not kill the baby, removal form the baby's natural environment will.

According to Dr Jerome Lejeune, a French geneticist says that life begins at fertilization.

Dr Keith L. Moore states the fertilized ovum, known as a "Zygote" is a large diploid cell that is the beginnings of a human being.

Dr T. W. Sadler states that functioning neuroligical structures necessary for pain sensation are in place to a degree as early as 8 weeks.

It has been discovered in a week old embryo, a single cell of DNA can now tell us the sex of the embryo which tells me that qualifies for personhood. This is being done in peternity cases.
