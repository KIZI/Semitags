As a future rival to the United States, and the Western world in general, which of the two most likely future superpowers, namely India and China, would you prefer?
 
 
I'd prefer India. However, what we're going to get is China.
 
 
China and India aren't the next superpower. You can't be a superpower if you relay only on cheap exports. The majority of their population is poor and when the current working population become old. Their economy would suffer.
 
 
It doesn't matter if the government cares. They will still lose a large section of their working population. Who go from earning money for the country to needing money from the country. To be a superpower you have to have a sustainable economy. USA has it and that is why is it the only super power.

India.
They are a democracy ( the world's largest democracy ) while China is some sort of weird amalgam between an oligocracy and dictatorship that pretends that it is communist.

And China has a habit of firing missiles near Taiwan to threaten them.
I really dont trust the Chinese. They are nearly as bad as the US.
 
 
Well, I'm Chinese, so 'nuff said  .
 
 
The financial press are going crazy over the rise of the Indian and Chinese economies. After a long period of relative stagnation these two countries have seen their incomes grow at remarkably high rates over the last two decades. Enthusiastic journalists have referred to their economic reforms and integration into the world economy in all kinds of colorful metaphors: giants shaking off their "socialist slumber," "caged tigers" unshackled, and so on.

From my own perception there is no doubt that both China and India have great potential in the rest of this century, however severe structural and institutional problems will hobble them for years to come. At this point the hype about the Indian economy in particular seems premature and then there is the authoritarian nature of China to consider.

India wonâ€™t be a superpower for the foreseeable future. Its economy will recede as quickly as it has grown. The free market moves, when it becomes cheaper to place call centres and manufacturing plants in South America or Africa 10s of millions of people will be made redundant and investment will dry up.
 
 
Like previous poster said India is probably preferable to China but in all likelyhood China is the next superpower - not, however, a hyperpower as the US was during the 90s because she will be challenged by the US (whose population is still growing at a good pace), Russia, India and the EU. Looking back on it in 50 years we might well wish that the West and India had allied to crush both China and the Islamic world that will soon be her natural ally against democracy. But, thanks to the 20th century, genocide is still a very dirty world in geopolitical circles.
 
 
I'm not surprised. You do know what it means, don't you?
 
 
India seems like a friendly country, whilst China has a menacing look upon her. Of course, it's usually the 'bad' countries which become determined to be superpowers...
 
 
Certainly, I've watched Schindler's List. An oversentimental film in my opinion but one that all Germans should be forced to watch ten times before breakfast every morning. Perhaps genocide is a ill-thought out word to use. Rather than a actual extermination of the entire Chinese population, I sought to express the fact that killing on an unimaginable and indescriminate scale would be necessary to subdue that country for any amount of time. Such a sacrifice is unpatable in geopolitcal circles but sometimes such decisions - such as the current one needed to destroy Iran - are necessary. The longterm benefits of a China-free world outweigh the shortterm costs of liquidating the Asian giant.
 
 
A more interesting question, for me, on this issue is why don't people give China and India the credit to be able to develop sustainably? Everyone seems to assume they're one trick ponies, only able to answer phones and make cheap and cheerful cr*p, when in reality they have an enormous, and rapidly expanding, amount of self-generated consumption. They're like any other developing country, just far bigger, there comes a point when their growth becomes sustainable; BRIC got there ages ago.

China's consumption is growing at over half the rate of the USA's (at the peak of their recent cycle) but with a 50% savings rate (as opposed to -1%) and a far smaller consumer base. On top of that, the amount of R&D going to China is also increasing rapidly. Indeed, it's starting to take it away from the West.

The fact of the matter is that people are either ignorant or stupid, BRIC are far more developed than they get credit for.

How did you work that one out? Didn't realise you were such an economic mystic...
 
 
I think the majority would prefer India (as the the poll indicates). Though most people are suggesting this is unlikely I think people tend to overlook the fact that politically China remains unstable. India, unlike its friendly neighbourhood superpower, has made that difficult transition to democracy. Thus the potential for political instability on a grand scale and the economic and governmental collapse which is synonomous with revolution, is far less likely in India.
 
 
india, obviously.

china is dangerous,

while india, because of British rule, is more tamed and westernized.

If only the leaders of the free world had your vision and foresight. I'm sorry but you are spouting palpable rubbish. You make a grand generalisation on some vaguely Benthamite premise - yet the consequences of such an action would be so far reaching that they would be impossible to gauge. Thus one could not tell whether or not it would be as profitable as you prophesise. Personally, I have moral reservations about the systematic massacre of 1billion people - I guess i find it 'unpalatable'.
 
 
India.

Oh i wish. The Muslim world is split in four. 1: Those that suck up to the west (arab countries) 2: Those that couldn't care or ashamed of their Muslim heritage and want to be more western (Turkey,Central Asia and others) 3: Those that don't care about religion just about their own power (Syria,Egypt and Iran ) and those that want their country to reflect the populations views. Islamic. So the chances of seeing a powerful Islamic alliance is non existent. The greediness of their leaders have to be "fixed" first.
 
 
They tend to band together if there's a common enemy, or threat, or just a common cause that they all support/oppose.

Because of course no other malevolent dictatorship would arise, and there would be no, shall we say, residual ill-will among the survivors.
 
 
As long as the sword of damacles remains fixed above the defeated China's remnants then ill-will should be fairly irrelevant.

To the poster who called my rather drastic suggestion that China be destroyed pre-emptively, I think it simpler and less parochial to refer to such an opinion as utilitarian.

How else could you justify it?
 
 
I wasn't denying that it could be called benthamite, but simply that it is more inclusive if the wider school of thought to which he belonged was the term used.
 
 
The number of variations on utilitarinism means I prefer to be specific but thats probaly me being a pedant. Mill's mutation of utilitarianism for example places huge emphasis on the rights of the individual. That is hardly compataible with the slaughter of 1 billion people.
 
 
Even cold, clinical, purely numerical Utilitarianism with no frills wouldn't justify genocide in and of itself. You'd have to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the killing of 1bn will - not might, but will - save >1bn lives. And I don't think that can be proved.

I concur absolutely hence why I said this to BJ dubois earlier:-

China, because of dialectics. To compete with a powerful China we'll have to adopt a lot of ideas and institutions that're currently unnecessary. The result will be less idealistic, better organised, more loyal and united Western countries.

I think under its thinly-layered Anglicised and Ghandi fanboy elite, India is just as different to the West as China is anyway, but it'll probably cave-in under its own corruption and divisions, so the stimulus for the previously mentioned changes would be less.

I think there is alot of truth in what you say, but I would still argue that China is a far less stable country. The 'cultural revolution' left a vacuum in China: a lack of understanding about the nations past has left a lack of 'self knowledge' and culture which seems to have been filled with simply an ravenous appetite for money. Consequently, a culture of ruthless individualism has arisen in China. This is perhaps inevitable, when one cannot look to the past for inspration they look to the future. It is this personal desire to effect and be affected which means that a dictatorship cannot survive. Its success relies, above all, on a common bond - a bond which does not exist within China. India unlike China has been united by its victory over the British Empire - an event whioch still lingers in modern memory, a unifier among the masses.

What doesn't kill us makes us stronger? But given the choice I'd pick the rival less likely to actually kill us.
 
 
A slight deversion perhaps, but isn't it likely that, since both countries are so similar in size, population and even ambition, the question of whether India or China will become the next superpower will be settled by a regional or even global war between the two. The potential for regional catastrophe would be huge, with Japan and Taiwan on India's side, Pakistan and the S. East Asian countries like Burma, Vietnam and Laos on China's side. It's probable that China would be the short term victor but with the US likely to way in on the Indian's behalf, their technology and firepower could swing it in a long, drawn out conflict that would make the second world war look like a tea party in comparison.

I wouldn't know to be honest. I'm always rattled by the way that a lot of people fall for this yellow peril sensationalism - that the Chinese will overtake the US shortly, that they'll be a world power, they're poisoning the water, etc, etc - they're sucking up China's own pretenses plus the propaganda of various special interest groups closer to home. However, I think I'm just as guilty here - I tend to see China as well organised and very united, but I'm largely just using official (party) statistics for that and no actual personal experience.

One interesting thought that's often passed by my mind is that there'll eventually be a conflict between the Hong Kong elite and the Communist Party, resembling the sort of business vs. aristocracy conflicts that were everywhere in industrialising Europe. Let's not forget that HK is the main reason China is even growing.

You do realise that not everything is solved by or can be solved by having a large war?

Well I'm not really explaining what I meant too well, but I don't think either of them could (or would want to) kill us physically.

Let's use an example to demonstrate the kind of thing I meant. take Chinas athlete training programs.. they're very coercive and demand a large ammount of dedication. Now, this is a very undesirable thing to practice, but may work much better than the modern western method of just leaving people to do what they want, hoping enough will have the self-motivation to succeed. Even a slight ammount of coercion in our universities and schools could go so much further, considering the large number of people who don't actually do anything and eventually get no where.

The point is, having been on top for so long without serious competition we've become quite flabby, inefficient and weak. China could rebalance this, since we'd have to change our ways to avoid becoming subordinate. I'm talking about incremental changes accross an axis here, not switching between such over-simplistic binary poles as 'coercion vs. liberty'.

If you fully understood what I meant originally and by kill you meant in the sense that a wholesale adoption of Naziism might have done, you could well be right. I personally don't want to see an end to democracy and a rise of ancient Egyptian-style slavery in the west, but I don't think it'll get close to that. It just means we'll have a better sense of who were are, and be more prepared to sacrifice things like our physical pleasure and material assets for the greater good.

How do you know a war that would have led to hundreds of millions of not running into the billions dead is better in the long run. Let me see your cost-benefit analysis of which you have clearly done. Please then lay this out in the forums giving some sort of basis for what you are saying.

 
Certainly, I've watched Schindler's List. An oversentimental film in my opinion but one that all Germans should be forced to watch ten times before breakfast every morning.
 

Yes because germans are more prone to commit mass genocide when compared to any other nation. They are even more likely to do it than people like you who are actively promoting it.

 
Perhaps genocide is a ill-thought out word to use. Rather than a actual extermination of the entire Chinese population, I sought to express the fact that killing on an unimaginable and indescriminate scale would be necessary to subdue that country for any amount of time. Such a sacrifice is unpatable in geopolitcal circles but sometimes such decisions - such as the current one needed to destroy Iran - are necessary. The longterm benefits of a China-free world outweigh the shortterm costs of liquidating the Asian giant.
 

Again this imaginary cost-benefit analysis has been done. Lets plunge the world into nuclear winter to subdue china.

 
As long as the sword of damacles remains fixed above the defeated China's remnants then ill-will should be fairly irrelevant.
 

Lol, yes suppress an entire nation.

 
To the poster who called my rather drastic suggestion that China be destroyed pre-emptively, I think it simpler and less parochial to refer to such an opinion as utilitarian.

You believe it is a utilitarian act. That doesnt make it one. In WW2 the atom bomb was used against the Japanese in a state of war. This may have led to less lives being lost, but the point is at least US lives werent lost. Was it a utilitarian act, it could be debated all day even with hindsight? It was at least this was ina state of war. You are predicting a Chinese/Islamic war and are willing to kill hundreds of millions in order to prevent this possibility. I would love to know how many people have died due to wars within the last 200 years. I doubt it runs into the billions. Again i am worried by how certain you are in your belief that this would be the correct course of action.

 
A slight deversion perhaps, but isn't it likely that, since both countries are so similar in size, population and even ambition, the question of whether India or China will become the next superpower will be settled by a regional or even global war between the two.
 

Why? There was never a direct war between the US and USSR. Maybe if you had been in the US administration you would have stopped communism immediately after WW2 sacrificing hundreds of millions of lives. And with hindsight i can say youd have been wrong to.

 
The potential for regional catastrophe would be huge, with Japan and Taiwan on India's side, Pakistan and the S. East Asian countries like Burma, Vietnam and Laos on China's side. It's probable that China would be the short term victor but with the US likely to way in on the Indian's behalf, their technology and firepower could swing it in a long, drawn out conflict that would make the second world war look like a tea party in comparison.
 

Not only have you predicted this regional war, you know exactly how it will progress.
 
 
Somehow India will. india always come on top, with the technology industry growing, the film industry and textiles, it surely will be big!!! it may not be a world power yet, maybe not as quick as china but will come out on top.
 
 
 , that being said I wouldn't mind India becoming a superpower, I'd hate for China to become one.
 
 
I don't see how having 2 billions (india + china) living at the western level is sustainable ( or even possible?). The world does not have the resources IMO. Its very worrying for the environment.

I don't think china and india will be able to overtake the US untill they can somehow reduce their huge wealth divides. We in the west should take advantage of the fact that we have far less poor people and are thus more united.

The issue of unity is also one my arguments against immigration. When the going gets tough, as i believe it will later this century our unity is going to be very important.

To this particular quote, what about North Korea?

Oh and what would the likelihood of this war which would make te 2ns world war looklike a tea party. surely, the fact that the nations have nuclear weapons would ensure that there would be a limit to the destruction (detterent): or wouldn't it?
 
 
Deterrence between superpowers works - or at least, worked between 1945 and 1990. There is no reason to suppose it will fail to do so again should India and China face off.

The world doesn't have enough resources to dramatically increase the number of people living at the current Western level of consumption provided that we currently know of all reserves of every resource, efficiency stays static, productivity stays static and that technology doesn't change. Those assumptions are obviously all false.

When will you capitalists get your head out of the sand!? the economic expansion and population growth humanity has experianced for the last several thousand years is just not infinite! it may seem infinite but this planets resources are very much limited!

Granted - we don't know what technology is around the corner or what may lie in every mm of this planet - but chances are we're not going to find a hidden stash of oil or develop a water genereation machine... be realistic the way we are going we are going to run out of resources. Water for one we understand well, we know where water is and how it moves. There is a finite amount - in order to live in harmony with the natural system we can only take so much.

I think it was estimated a while ago that for every human on earth to live like an american we would need 6 more earths to support them. Efficiency can only go so far - and our standard of living can only rise after this point if we reduce our numbers to a sustainable amount.

This isn't the place and i'm OT. But this is exactly the attitude that will cripple us in years to come. we need to take preventative action now.

Am I alone in prefering no rival to the US?

What will it do other than to force the creation of an arms race, trade war or worse?
 
 
Arguably, having a rival ensured the US behaved itself post-WWII. By and large. In the absence of such a rival, there's no telling what it'll do. It might be good, it might be bad, but without knowing which I'd say it's better to be safe than sorry.

It depends what you mean by rival. Back then the US was the only functioning developed country because Europe was in such a mess. It's quite scary what might have happened if there was no Soviet threat poised ready to overrun the west -McArthur using nukes in the Korean War springs to mind- but that just isn't going to happen when so many other powerful developed countries who aren't rivals to the US are around. I hope.

Arguably. But by behaved itself are we ignoring a massive arms race and several proxy wars?
 
 
Not ignoring. But comparing with what could have happened.

Imagine what would have happened if the Soviet Union had won the Cold War, right? Well, an unopposed America will almost certainly be nowhere near as bad, but the point is that nobody will be able to stop it if it does do bad stuff. Whereas with a rival always keeping it on its toes, it will be too busy with the rivalry to have the time or the resources to run rampant across the globe.

True. There are rivals and rivals. In effect, the various Great Powers (using the old definition, one step below Superpower) have the combined effect of one single foil to the US. By which I mean Japan, Brazil, Russia, China, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Europe, South Africa, Canada and Australia. Principally. And as long as that remains effective it's certainly preferable to a Cold War.

If we had the U.S., and the EU as the worlds only two superpowers, would they be too similar to each other for there to be any rivalry, or is there still a possibility of a Cold War scenario?
 
 
I back China

They don't mess around.
Plus, they are currently torchering Jack Baurer.

"China has a long memory, did you really think we would forget"

Evil and sedistic, I love it.

Their going to be the true masters of Asia, and they will invade Taiwan, the Americans claim they would not let such a thing happen, but they will simply stand back and watch because they fear the Chinese.

2008 is going to be an interesting year for Asia.

The EU is already as important as the US (arguably more important than) in terms of it's economic power. It's got a larger GDP, larger capacity for growth and more room for improvements in efficiency.

It would be more correct to talk about China & India rivaling the US & EU. This is going to remain a four way thing for the foreseeable future. Our advantage is that the US and the EU are natural collaborators (just) whilst China and India are natural rivals.

The EU as a diluted Soviet Union? I can quite see Americans swallowing that portrayal   We're all dirty Socialists in their opinion already.

On balance, though, in that situation the probability of a Cold War on anything like the post-WWII scale is very low. The ideological enmity is simply not there, so at most you'd get trade rivalry between the two, carried out through "neo-imperialist" antics.

Are you refering to the Olympics or global meltdown, because watching Paula Radcliffe take a s*** on the side of the street is not my idea of interesting. It's more of an erotic experience on the hole.

Torchering? Where do they stick their flashlight? You're just a regular Henry Kissenger. How can you seriously fear the Chinese, they're Ronnie Corbett size and they still got thrashed by the even shorter Japanese for hundreds of years.

I'd question the truth in your argument that the EU has a greater capacity for growth than the US. The European population is rather stagnant, with immigration (an ultimately divisive process) responsible for the greatest population growth in the short term. Forecasts for the US, however, predict a rapidly expanding population (it reached 300 million this year) that will eventually stretch to around 500 million citiizens. The sheer scale of the US in geographic and economic terms is often underestimated and it still has the potential to doubles its population and increase productivity. It's greater political stability should also give it an advantage over the EU and more drastically India and China.

Ultimately a consolidation of the Anglosphere into a larger Eurosphere that encompasses all European peoples that includes S.America, Oceania, N.America and of course Europe would be preferable to EU/US rivalry. Far more unites the cultures than divides them, especially the liberal democratic values of the Enlightnenment that must triumph over the Islamic theocracy and Chinese totalatarianism that offers alternate and awful methods of statecraft.

In all this of course, we underestimate the potential for Africa - a minerally rich and enviromentally fertile continent - to get its act together. I would look to a conflict between the Christian sub-sahara and the Muslim north for perhaps the most brutal clash of civilisations. It seems to be occuring in Darfur and Somalia already.

Stagnant in some areas of Western Europe, which have population profiles that are only slightly more developed than the US. Eastern and central Europe are still expanding faster than the US though. Accession will be responsible for the largest population growth in both the long and short term. The EU is that rarest of things, a super power who's borders are expanding.

The US population, as a whole, is about as developed as Western Europe and will grow at a similar rate. The EU, as a whole still retains an advantage.

The US economy is in a soft landing scenario, the PBoC has them by the balls through the Yuan and they won't see characteristic long term growth until they're yield curve is sorted out and the USD gets some freedom.

As far as productivity is concerned, the US is far more advanced than the EU. They haven't as widespread a tradition of interfering bureaucracy and have allowed their business to get a significant march on the EU. The UK is one of the only EU members that achieves anything like the productivity of the US and we're still miles behind. With even large, supposedly developed, nations like France and Germany having massive potential for advances in productivity and efficiency, the EU easily has more potential than the US.

I thought China had everyone by the balls through the Yuan. The EU included. If not, why not?

USD is by far their largest reserve currency and despite the rate being pegged to a basket, which sounds more dramatic than it is, the largest intervention in the credit market is still in USD.

It would be better for the EU to have a floating Yuan but if it didn't happen it wouldn't be the end of the world, at least not yet. A pegged Yuan has far more dire and immediate implications for the US. Thankfully the US and WTO pressure is going in our favour.
 
 
What about a possible Islamic civilization? The emergence of a Greater Arab state, or even a Islamic empire, similar to the Ottoman/Turkish empire would be disastrous for the West, and India.

Also, if Turkey was to accepted into the EU, would that strengthen the EU, or weaken it as a potential future superpower?
 
 
Pan-Arabism died with Nasser. Its only modern remnants are - or were - the Iraqi and Syrian Ba'ath parties, which even before the former was forcibly destroyed were quite definitely divided and even opposed to one another on some issues. Additionally, the divisions between Shia and Sunni present, in my view, too great a barrier for a meta-Arab nation to arise.

The EU/Turkey question is a whole separate debate - several whole separate debates, in fact. I personally am undecided on the issue, but either way I'd rather this thread didn't get sidetracked onto it. Thanks.
 
 
As the second poster said, I would prefer India (Worlds Largest Democracy and all) but we are going to get China   - which is rather worrying at best.

It could possibly strengthen it in that it may make it more acceptable to other Islamic nations (i.e. having what is essentially an Islamic Nation as a member). As well as giving an EU Super State a strategic key point in the world (i.e. the bridge between Asia and Europe).
