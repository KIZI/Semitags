Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich vows to appeal his single conviction against him and says he's the victim of persecution by the federal government.

Blagojevich spoke to reporters on Tuesday after a jury found him guily of one count of lying to federal agents. The judge declared a mistrial in the other 23 counts against him.
