Visa is to blame for a Senate proposal that would cap fees merchants pay to
accept debit cards, Discover Financial Services Chief Executive Officer David
Nelms said Thursday.

"Visa has tremendous market power in this area, and that's how we ended up
here," Nelms said in an interview Thursday after Riverwoods, Ill.-based Discover
posted second-quarter results. "Visa raised prices quite a bit and, I think,
took the actions that have led to the legislation in the first place."

The measure pushed by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Il., as part of the financial-overhaul
bill would empower the Federal Reserve to set "swipe" fees, or interchange, that
are "reasonable and proportional" to the cost of processing debit transactions.
The Illinois Democrat and majority whip also backs a provision that directs the
Fed to issue rules barring networks from requiring that their debit cards can
only be used on one network.

That non-exclusivity rule may create an opportunity for the Discover-owned Pulse
debit network and other competitors to gain market share. San-Francisco-based
Visa, Inc., the world's biggest payments network, accounted for 73 percent of
U.S. debit purchase volume last year.

"That opens up the prospect that Pulse or other debit networks could no longer
be excluded from those cards, and that could be a pro-competitive outcome,"
Nelms said. Discover opposes Durbin's proposed debit-fee caps as government
price controls "could be a negative for consumers," Nelms said.

Visa spokesman Will Valentine declined to comment.

Visa and No. 2 MasterCard set interchange fees and pass the money to card-
issuers including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. Interchange is the largest
component of the fees U.S. merchants pay to accept Visa and MasterCard debit
cards. The fees totaled $19.7 billion and averaged 1.63 percent of each sale
last year, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
