The International Book Fair (Buch Wien 10), the largest of its kind in Austria,
opened at the International Exhibition Center (Messe Wien) in Vienna on
Thursday. Including the China Book Trading Ltd. a total of 250 exhibitors from
12 countries are attending the book fair.

During the "Buch Wien 10", all the reading-related products and services are on
display. The children books, books of recipes, as well as those books and
printed materials with attractive individual design are the highlights of this
book fair.

However, in comparison with the book fair in Frankfurt this year, fewer digital,
electronic and network-related books are shown in the book fair in Vienna. The
traditional printed books and magazines and printed materials remain as dominant
products.

General Manager of the China Book Trading Ltd. Zhang Genduan told reporters that
the current rapid development in Internet and digital media poses a great
challenge to the traditional printed material market, such as newspaper and
books, as the pace of modern life is speeding up, demanding for obtaining a lot
of information as soon as possible.

He said,"The book market has responded to changes in lifestyle, which is that
people like e-books, picture stories, but the long novel."However, he believes
that the overwhelming majority of people still maintain their reading habits, as
well as the pursuit of reliability and security of information, which means, the
printed books materials will remain as an important media.

President of Austria Main Publishing Federation, Gerald Schantin also stressed
at the opening ceremony of book fair 2010, that books and other print media
continue to be the "media of reliable and authoritative knowledge."

He also believes that, while printed books are facing a huge competition from
Internet, its status of the mainstream media will remain unchanged.

It is the first time for China Book Trading Ltd. to attend the International
Book Fair in Vienna. It has brought a large number of German and Chinese books
to exhibition. Many of them are published by this company in cooperation with
German publishers.
