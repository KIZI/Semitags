South Korea's telecom watchdog said Friday that the country may face another
online attack similar to what occurred in early July, calling for precautions.

The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said that personal computer users
should be extra careful as they use the Internet amid warnings of the so-called
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

The KCC is being on alert over the weekend, although there is no sign of an
imminent DDoS attack in South Korea, as popular social networks such as
'Twitter,' 'Facebook' and 'LiveJournal' were under those attacks on Thursday,
officials at the KCC said.

While it is closely observing the possibility of online attacks, the KCC said it
has not adjusted the alert level on online attacks yet.

Starting from July 7, a DDoS attack, which employs computers from various
regions to flood large amounts of data into targeted servers, causing shut-downs
in such websites, for three days struck major websites in South Korea, including
those of South Korea's presidential office and other major government bodies.
