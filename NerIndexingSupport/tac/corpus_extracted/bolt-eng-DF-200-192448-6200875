I read with interest that following Malcolm Glazer's takeover of Man U, the wonderful Labour Government in their infinite wisdom is now going to seek to impose legislation to block such acquisitions of football clubs in the future by foreign investors. Here's the story:

 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main...15/nfoot15.xml 

What the blazes is going on in the UK - is it legislature to suit the chav? First get rid of fox-hunting on the highly questionable grounds of "animal cruelty" (regardless of the fact that there are numerous other activities that have been deemed more cruel by the Animal Welfare League than fox hunting, including battery-farming of chickens and angling (any plans to outlaw those, Tone, or are too many of your loyal supporters keen fishers who like cheap eggs?). And now this. I suppose New Labour has identified football fans as its target electorate base, so needs to rush through rulings that will specifically cater for them.

I don't know, it all seems highly questionable constitutionally to me - as if they are just making it up as they are going along to please the proletariat, regardless of whether there is a moral or legal rationale behind any of these decisions. A dangerous way to make law, bending to the strain of the most vocal public opinion.
 
 
This government plans things...?
 
 
Hah, what a joke! I could imagine them proposing to do it before an election, but this is just pure silly. What will the act be called? "Premier League Football Team Anti-Foreign Investment Hostile Takeover Act 2005"? Tone and his croneys make an ass of the law.
 
 
Yeah - good ol' Perma-Tone. I like the way that its just football clubs - its fine to have foreign bidders come in when it helps out, like with ailing Midlands manufacturers of crap cars, but when its a globally recognised club like Man U, it makes all the difference. Why doesn't he just pass a bill that will legislate to do "whatever the fock I want"? I also like the way Tony Banks has been ranting about Glazer's takeover, in the same way he was about Abrahamovich 2 years ago regarding Chelsea. And who was amongst the first to praise Roman upon Chelsea's securing of the Premiership last week - the self-same Tony Banks. Why are we governed by such fockwits - I can only conclude that the salaries aren't high enough to attract anyone with half a brain.

if you knew anything about the situation you'd know that glazer is going to bring billions of pounds worth of debt with him. thats what the fans oppose, and the fact that this jumped up red neck isn't even interested in the game, and hasn't even visited the club. you're talk of legislature to suit "the chav" is absurd. the whole tradition of the club will be lost.

about 500 million pounds worth actually.

And who says the tradition of the club will be lost? Did Abaramovich know much about th e"tradition" of Chelsea?
 
 
Here are my views on the situation...

The move to buy United is a bad thing as Glazer doesnt give a toss about the club. He mearly sees it as a potential income for himself. The prices are going to go up, the finnical state of the club is going to be alot worse under him. The fans are going to suffer as all the matches are put on to a pay per view tv channel.

However he is mearly doing what any good business man would do. Surley the blame for this lies with the fact that the club was allowed to be floated on the stockmarket at all? As soon as that happened, the club handed over its soverignity and culture to business.

i think thats different because at least he's at every game and takes an interest. chelsea is still chelsea, the best players are british, so i don't think much tradition has been lost there. tho i do object to the whole principle of buying success. my point about glazer is that hasn't even visited man united, he's a greedy red neck, and therefore to buy it is wrong.

Good to see you're back with your usual abrupt format sophie D - "If I knew anything about the situation". Well, of course I defer to your worldly knowledge as an 18 year old girl whose dad's told her everything, so you'll have to bear with me on this one.

How its financed is immaterial. He will want to see a return on investment, be it debt or equity. he isn't trying to create some tax-losses here so its fair to say that he's probably not going to try to run the club into the ground.

The whole nonsense about "he's not even interested in the game" really cracks me up. So friggin' what? - did you have to be interested in planes since you were 1 to be the CEO of British Airways, have a mobile phone at 3 to be head of vodafone, drinking ale at 5 to be in charge of Allied Domecq... it really doesn't matter. Man U's board made their bed when they brought the company to the market - if you don't want to be taken over, don't become a PLC and enjoy the benefits it affords you. I notice the UK gov't hasn't been too worried about foreign companies like compagnie general des eaux / vivendi buying all sorts of uk utilities - its amazing they are getting their knickers in a twist over this.

but obviously these are just the rantings of a man who doesn't know anything of the situation. honestly, you don't help yourself do you?

Its not immaterial to the fans as the money is likely to come out of their pockets rather than sucess from trophies.

huh? what - he's going to push up ticket prices to alienate the fan base and reduce merchandise sales at Old Trafford is he? Is that before or after he takes a shotgun and blows his own foot off?

Exactly the same criticism was leveled at Abramovich - I remember Tony Banks on Talksport radio going on about how he didn't think it should be allowed, where did this guy get his money from, it was an elaborate money-laundering operation buying chelsea, he was going to put ticket prices up, run the club into the ground, develop the freehold site - all sorts of nonsense Banks was going on about in July 2003. And who was amongst the first to congratulate Roman last week (as he was sitting next to him in the box at Stamford Bridge). Tony Banks.

People seem to have short memories and an irrational side when it comes to football. It is just a business, its exploited left right and centre by advertiserrs, managers, agents, players. i'm amazed anyone has any loyalty left and to get worked about about a PLC that's being taken over strikes me as very un-newsworthy. I find particularly strange how shareholders united claim to own 18% of the company when Glazers got 75% - so there are 103% of shares in man u are there? seems some of shareholders united decided they'd have the cash sooner rather than later. there's loyalty for you.

Get used to it, this is what happens when sport turns professional and football is not the only one. And Chelsea are hardly the first to 'buy' honours. Then again, teams have splashed out on players who flump and hardly win anything, just ask Massimo Moratti. You would never hear Glazer say, for example: "There have been times when I have come back to my house after spending €40m on a player and wondered whether I have done the right thing. The doubts start to creep in and I start to wonder if I have made a mistake." Those are the words of Inter president Massimo Moratti, whose £446m outlay on 116 players has yielded one UEFA Cup win in ten years.

Then again, Man Utd lost 3-1 to Chelsea's reserves and Utd's Rooney, Ferdinand, Ronaldo and van Nistlerooy cost more than the Chelsea starting line up combined. Let us not forget that Porto knocked Utd out of the Champions League last year and were 1/10th as rich as Utd.

So, take an interest in hurling if you want.

You could level the same criticism at any Premiership squad player on £10K+ a week salary. How much of a toss do they give about the club - they are quite happy to move. I think that players salaries have been the main reason for the increase in ticket prices for matches and also the price of Sky Sports subscriptions. No one seems to be too concerned about all the greedy foreign players playing for Man U - I mean, if they really "loved" the game, why don't they play for, say, £50K a year. that's a good salary for kicking a ball around 2 times a week, with some training in between.
 
 
But the question is why did United go public on the stock exchange?

if im being honest, i don't actually give one. i just like disagreeing with everything jrhartley says. after all i don't even support manchester united. each to his own! so please, don't patronise me.
 
 
Hopefully for them, the mancs are just overreacting. Since Glazer is out to make money, and a huge chunk of that comes from merchandise, upsetting the fans is the last thing he wants.

The Chelsea takeover didn't cause as much of a media stirr, so I'm not that familiar with it - but wasn't he already a big fan, who'd been to at least a handful of matches?

P.S. SophieD has a sexy initial.

Well Banks found time to sound off about it to anyone who'd give him airtime, and again, I really don't see what difference going to a match, being a fan, etc makes. its a business, most clearly demonstrated by the 22 playes in the pitch on huge salaries.

This is totally irrelevant to the discussion at hand. I think you would be a very foolish man to tell Roy Keane that he has no loyality.

who knows, but if ticket prices rise then its been more down to players salaries to date than foreign investors. no one seems to concerned about them. glazer will work out what the optimum level he can set ticket prices at to ensure people will still turn up and spend money. i don't see what the problem is - if you think the price is too high, don't watch. its the same with anything - you ascribe a value to something, if the price is higher than that value, you won't buy it.

 
Originally Posted by material breach

not you specifically. more tony banks, and a lot of people who criticised abramovich when he bought chelsea and are now ringing his praises. its interesting that banks is now attacking glazer - probably worried that he'll spend more than chelsea on new players and mount a fresh challenge to chelsea's supremacy.

fans lose sight of the fact that football for a long time now has just been one big money making factory, and that the fans are just cogs in the grand machine. players, agents, managers, tv companies, shareholders are all taking their cut. it amazes me that they get so incensed by someone like glazer doing this when it seems to me that they've been taking it up the ar$e so to speak for about 15 years now.

why is it? are you saying that players inflated salaries have not contributed to higher ticket prices / the financial collapse of more than a few football clubs? Because you would be a very foolish man to say that they haven't. for every example you cite of a player who has been at a club for ages and refuses to transfer, i can list you at least 10 others who would jump ship for the right salary at another club in the UK or in Europe, and who have done. so i think that's probably not a good route to go down, argument wise.

Oh, btw, if we are being strictly true to the discussion at hand, then according to the thread title, it was more about knee-jerk proposed legislation, but I accept that we've gone off on the Man U ownership debate, which seems to have evoked more passion.

The majority of players are genuinely interested in playing football at the higest level. They are of course as your arguement goes, try to play for the club which is the best and where they are paid the most. However they have an inherent interest in the game rather than just a pure monatary one which is what you are claiming they have.

Yes I accept too we have strayed a little. HOwever the question as whether this is a good thing for manchester utd is important as if that fact is established it would be wrong for the governemt to intervene.

Alot of football fans would like the prices of tickets set so that those who have supported the club all their lives and do not have the greatest amount of wealth can still go the club and give support. Huge hikes in prices will deny them this.

Yeah, let's set all prices while we are there, as well. I mean we've been buying things all our lives...

I'd quite like my electricity, water, food bills, etc to be a bit lower. maybe if tesco wasn't making a 30% operating margin on its sales, then they would be. maybe if Electricite de France didn't own London Electricity, then bills for London customers would be lower? We could drive ourselves mad here with a dissection of the pros and cons of capitalism. the fact is this is the world we live in - we need to deal with it, and we can't go around creating special cases for footballers, old ladies who think their shopping bills are too expensive, etc. etc.

again, this stems back to the board's decision to list the club. if they had really cared about those long-term fans at the outset, they wouldn't have become a plc and netted themselves some nice share options and shares. but then, if they hadn't been an IPO, would man u have been able to buy the players it has bought. its swings and roundabouts, you've to to take the rough with the smooth, you can't have your cake and eat it.... hmmm i think that will do for the analogies for now...!

Which is why I suggested in my first post that floating the club on the stock market was the problem.

I cannot see how anyone could argue that the government should pass legislation to block future sales of football clubs to foreign investors on the grounds of it "being against the public interest". If this happens, then someone at Whitehall has managed to lose sense of all perspective in contrast to the real issues in the UK and the world.

BTW, there's no way the gov't can block glazer - they accept that its a fait accompli, so there's no undoing it now.

I know, I accept that you highlighted the dilemma, but given the float happened, you can't rewrite history and have to accept the consequences now, so there is no grounds for after-the-event legislation because some man u fans are upset, after reaping all the gains whilst the club was a plc.

No - I'm not disputing that these guys love kicking a ball around a pitch - for many of them its all they can actually do, so that's good for them that they've found their niche. it still doesn't quite explain, if they really felt passionate and loyal and had the best interests of the club at heart, why they don't just accept a moderate salary of £50K a year, rather than £50K a week.

whether they have the best interests in the club or not is irrelevent as I said as Glazer clearly doesnt give a flying **** about football yet alone man utd. At least the players care about football. They have given up thousands of hours in the rain even before they got paid a pound. Therefore they clearly are different to glazer.

I concede that I was wrong to intially use the club when I should of used the word football but with this alteriation my point still stands.

I still don't see what the differentiation is. Most clubs can't afford the amount they pay their players, yet how often do you see squads coming forward with offers to reduce their collective pay packets by even 20%. It only ever happens when the receivers are about to kick the door down on a club, and there are no financial options left for the club if its going to stay in business. the fact is that the majority of footballers are quite thick and couldn't hope to do anything else that would ever pay them what they get for playing football, so the fact that they've spent thousands of hours in the rain practicing is just a product of their circumstances. that's not a criticism of them, good on them from being a bit of a flunky pupil into the guy who's on tv every saturday pm, driving a fast car and, in the case of wayne rooney, shagging 55 year old prostitutes.

but equally, just because glazer has been more successful in other areas of his life and been a bit busy with his other business interests doesn't mean that he shouldn't be allowed to buy a football club. coming back to one of my original posts, are we now saying that people can't have jobs or run businesses UNLESS they can categorically display a history of an interest in that industry all their lives? Should people who work in Tesco be fired if they are caught shopping in Sainsbury's? Should people who work for the BBC be banned from watching ITV? seen through to its logical conclusion, the argument that Glazer has never been to a match or had any interest in soccer in his life strikes me as without bearing on whether he should be allowed to buy a business.

they are a PLC.

there wasnt people yapping when they listed and made a fortune. shame they forgot to realise that as a company with shares, these can be bought by anyone!

Why did United go public in 1991, and how did it benefit the club? The answer lies in the figures: the former owner of the club, Martin Edwards, made in excess of £90m from the original flotation and subsequent sales of his United shares. The club has received £22m from the flotation and a later placing of shares on the market. They sold out years ago.
 
 
Here we have a foreign businessman buying shares off mostly foreign investors to take over a team where the players are all practically foriegners. What's the big deal? If a shareholder wants to sell his stock to someone, then let him. The government has no right to stick its nose into private enterprise, into something that has nothing to do with them whatsoever. As a conservative, I believe that it is a man's right to buy whatever company that he wants, and the government should do nothing to prevent him doing so.

Well, according to some TSR's finance experts like SophieD, the problem is the way the deal is going to be financed. They are concerned about the debt / equity mix. Personally, I don't really see how this makes any difference as any investor will be worried about his RoIC - return on invested capital and IC is not just the equity or the debt, its is the two combined. But hey, what would I know about financing takeovers, deals like that, much better to leave that sort of judgement to those in the know like the real 'Red Devils' fans and their thorough grasp of capitalism.
 
 
United sold their souls years ago, and you reap what you sow. See you on the way down  
 
 
Here's something to read about it  here .
 
 
Even though I am a Lib Dem (^ see above,) I agree with Waddell and Hartley on this one. If United didn't want to be bought off they shouldnt have gone PLC. You took the decision, now take the consequences

That's irrelevent. Man U is a business and he is a business man. If he thought he could make more money by selling Jaffa cakes he'd buy McVities; it really wouldn't matter whether he personally liked Jaffa cakes or hated them.

"The whole tradition of the club will be lost" you say. What tradition? The tradition of paying enormous gobs of money to foreign born players who play when they feel like it and probably can't point to Manchester on a map? The tradition of changing strip designs 20 odd times a season, having them made out of shoddy materials for $2 in China and selling them for $50 to vain and stupid people? Take heart. I doubt these glorious traditions are about to change anytime soon.

The fans really aren't in much position to complain - they were all thrilled when they found out their club was super rich after it floated.. until Chelsea burst their bubble.

Glazier saw an opportunity and decided to take it. Man Utd haven't done as well as the dizzy heights of the 90's and so Glazier could well be the man to change things around..

I don't understand your point of the tradition of the club being lost. Chelsea seemed to gain a lot more when they got taken over.. a Premiership title being the start of it.

I don't think Man Utd have a great deal to be worried about other than the debt it'll bring to the club.. which it'll probably work off after a few seasons. The problems lie for the Premier League in general and what Glazier may try to do with television rights when the current contract runs out in a couple of years..

I like the parallels going on here between sophieD and Man U. Man U become a PLC, get loads of money, spend it on foreign players then moan when another foreigner buys them out. sophieD posts a contrary post just to try to rile me, then starts moaning when others criticise her weak argument.

quite zen, isn't it?

Basically what can be summarised from reading the below links:

Glazer probably thinks he can compete with Abramovich but I'm sorry you can't.
