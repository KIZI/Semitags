Algeria's rail network resumed operation on Sunday evening after the national
operator's workers ended a strike that lasted for eight days, state-run APS news
agency reported Monday.

The North African country's rail network has come to a standstill after the
National Railway Company (SNTF) workers went on a strike, demanding a salary
increase of 20-23 percent. The SNTF said it cannot meet such demands, citing
financial difficulties. The workers even defied an order by an Algiers court to
stop the strike and immediately resume work.

The National Federation of Railway (FNC), the railway workers' union, "issued a
call for all workers to end the strike" after their demands were addressed, FNC
secretary-general for communication Djamel Bechikhi was quoted by the agency as
saying. Yet, the report did not give further details on the compromise reached.

"Traffic is already beginning to resume... Commuter trains have already started
to circulate," Bechikhi said.

Head of SNTF human resources department Noureldin Dekhli told local al-Khabar
newspaper that the operations will resume as both parties will engage in talks
on pay rise.

"We have urged all workers, in a joint statement, to resume operating the trains
and transporting passengers immediately as of Sunday evening," he said.

According to the paper, the talks came after Transport Minister Amar Tou ordered
SNTF administration to address the workers' demands and engage in talks with the
union about salary increase.
