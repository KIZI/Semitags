"Houston Gets $60 Million Space Lab for Research on Moon Shot"
blared
the Houston Chronicle headline on Sept. 19, 1961. The coup was big,
big
news, commanding nearly all the front page, relegating the city's
usual
preoccupations -- oil, football, hurricanes and communism -- to the
forlorn bottom corners.

And why not? Project Apollo, "the quest for the moon," was
coming to
town. A "spacious, self-contained research city" would be built
22 miles
southeast of downtown, and the capsules "in which the moon
voyagers will
ride" would be designed here. Other cities might build the rockets
or be
home to the launch pad. But thanks to an exercise in raw political
power, Houston would be the moon shots' command center, the boss.

Those early news stories gravitated toward financial matters,
with
ecstatic descriptions of federal dollars about to deluge the city.
But
money was only the start of Apollo's effect on Houston -- a city, in
1961, with barely a million inhabitants and better known for oil
money
than good restaurants..

But Project Apollo broadened us: To the oilmen who dominated our
civic
psyche, we added astronauts and engineers. Apollo fixed Houston's
eyes
on the future: After years of being part of the backwoods oil
patch, it
became Space City, USA, where engineers were designing the world of
tomorrow. And Apollo cemented the notion that Houston is a can-do
place,
able to git'r'done no matter how big the job.

During the heady race for the moon, backwoods, bumptious Houston
suddenly felt like the center of the universe. When Kennedy talked
of
"the New Frontier," he seemed to be talking about the young,
barely-tamed city itself. The Manned Space Center sprouted on land
where
cattle had grazed.

And bang: Just like that, Houston, home of the Fat Stock Show,
suddenly,
surprisingly became the city from which humans reached for the
stars.

COMME IL FAUT

On the Fourth of July, 1962, Houston (in the words of The
Houston Post)
"did its darnedest ... to slip a hammerlock on the hearts of its
newest
citizens." To welcome the seven astronauts and hundreds of NASA
employees, the chamber of commerce organized a morning parade
through
downtown, with the fresh-off-the-plane astronauts and their
families
waving from convertibles at the sweaty hundreds of thousands on the
sidewalks. An honest-to-gosh Mercury 6 capsule brought up the rear,
like
Santa Claus at a Thanksgiving parade. Lest anyone not recognize the
famous hardware, that proud artifact of the Space Age, someone
taped a
hand-lettered sign to it: "Mercury Capsule," the label said, as
earnest
and homemade-looking as a grade-school science project.

The parade led triumphantly to a welcoming wingding at the Sam
Houston
Coliseum, with four tons of barbecue and uncounted gallons of
whiskey.
The celebrity-challenged city tried hard to impress its new
residents.
Miss Houston, 19-year-old Elsie Wilmoth, was hailed as a dignitary,
as
was Gene Barry, star of the Bat Masterson TV show.

The chamber of commerce president awarded the seven astronauts
$100
LBJ-style cowboy hats. Not to be outdone, the Harris County sheriff
gave
them little tin badges designating them "space deputies."

Then an announcer proclaimed the bizarre piece de resistance of
that
family-oriented, middle-of-the-day shindig: Sally Rand, a burlesque
dancer maybe four decades past her prime. A band blared, spotlights
glowed, and then and there, at around two in the afternoon, the
blonde
well into her senior years performed her famous fan dance.

Much later, in "The Right Stuff," Tom Wolfe described that
dance. Rand,
he wrote, "winked and minced about and took off a little here and
covered a little there and shook her ancient haunches at the seven
single-combat warriors. It was quite electrifying. It was quite
beyond
sex, show business, and either the sins or rigors of the flesh....

"The Venus de Houston shook her fanny in an utterly baffling
blessing
over it all."

EARTHMEN

How Houston loved NASA! How it loved being Space City!

In 1966 Houston proudly opened the Astrodome, the world's first
roofed,
air-conditioned stadium. Its groundskeepers, called "Earthmen,"
wore
pseudo-spacesuits, complete with glass-fronted helmets. Pretty
"spacettes" wore gold-lame dresses and tall blue boots.

Our pro baseball team was rechristened the Astros. And in 1971,
when we
imported a basketball team from San Diego, it seemed providential
that
the team was already named the Rockets.

Houston's space fever peaked the same day that everyone elses's
did: On
July 20, 1969, the day the first human set foot on moon. "Houston,
Tranquillity base here," Neil Armstrong famously radioed. "The
Eagle has
landed." Houston, as the city's boosters will never stop crowing,
was
the first word spoken on the moon.

For a moment, human history seemed to have set itself a new
course.
Buckminster Fuller proclaimed Apollo 11 "at the "dead center of
evolutionary events." Richard Nixon called it "the greatest week
in the
history since the beginning of the world, the creation. Nothing has
changed the world more than this mission."

Then the fever passed. The Apollo program stuck around for a few
more
missions to the moon. The last, Apollo 17, splashed back down to
Earth
on December 7, 1972. And with that, the space race quietly ended.

NASA still hums along, of course, but without the old glamour
and glory.
Houston still sometimes calls itself Space City. But the nickname
has
become an exercise in nostalgia.

Apollo astronaut Alan Bean, the fourth man to walk on the moon,
still
lives in Houston. Bean thinks Houston hasn't done enough to
memorialize
the splendid era of its Apollo past. The city needs a monument, he
thinks -- something larger than downtown's Tranquillity Park,
something
on the city-defining scale of the St. Louis arch, something of a
grandeur appropriate to the accomplishment it would mark.

"We did something here unique in human history," Bean says.
"We need
something to say, 'This is where humans conceived plans to leave
the
Earth. And then they did it."'
