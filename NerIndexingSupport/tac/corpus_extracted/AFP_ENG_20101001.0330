Australian Michael Matthews produced a powerful finishing burst to claim the
under-23 men's crown here at the world road race cycling championships Friday.

Matthews, 20, finished the 159 km race ahead of German John Degenkolb and
American Taylor Phinney, who took the bronze medal.

Matthews, who races for the Jayco team but is set for a professional contract
next year, kept his composure amid a bunch of around 30 riders as they powered
uphill towards the finish of the 10-lap race.

Degenkolb launched his sprint with around 250 metres to go, however Matthews
played a waiting game before digging deep and overtaking the German to win with
room to spare.

It is Australia's first gold medal of the five-day championships, which continue
Saturday with the women's road race and end Sunday with the blue riband of the
elite men's 267.2 km race.
