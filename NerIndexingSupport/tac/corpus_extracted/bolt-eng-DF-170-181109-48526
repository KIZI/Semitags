 
 
Arrest warrant for Cheney will be issued and transmitted through Interpol"
 
 
Indictments will be lodged in a Nigerian court in the next three days, Godwin Obla, prosecuting counsel at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, said in an interview today at his office in Abuja, the capital. An arrest warrant for Cheney will be issued and transmitted through Interpol, the worlds biggest international police organization, he said.

Furthermore:
Obla said charges will be filed against current and former chief executive officers of Halliburton, including Cheney, who was CEO from 1995 to 2000, and its former unit KBR Inc., based in Houston, Texas; Technip SA, Europes second-largest oilfield- services provider; Eni SpA, Italys biggest oil company; and Saipem Construction Co., a unit of Eni. Obla didnt identify the former officials whom he said held office when the alleged bribes were paid.

Just sayin'.

 Dick Cheney to be Indicted in Nigerian Bribery Case Task Force on Financial Integrity and Economic Development 
 
 
I got an email from Godwin Obla today. He wants my bank account number so he can transfer $500,000 into it.

Those lawyers in Nigeria went to school in Oxford. Those are not "bushmen" so skip the attacks.

Cheney was found "not guilty" by the "Gonzales/Ashcroft" "Bush/Cheney" justice department. We all know how "honest" THAT administration was.
 
 
They're pretty smart, alright. Nigeria is the phishing and identity theft capital of the world.

What's the number for Interpol. I need to turn them in.
 
 
Yeah..Kissenger was nervous too.
 
 
I hope Interpol doesn't fall for this:

 
From   r.Aguike Benson
The shipment of your contract sum,
Sequel to the secretive arrangement in regards of the shipment of your contract sum, I wish to inform you that all necessary modalities have been automatically concluded and have left Nigeria to London via your Country today by diplomatic Cargo Flight.
Note carefully the content of the crate is"MONEY" but I did not disclose it to the Courier Services as Money,rather I informed them that the crate contain Vital"DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENTS" belonging to my client (that?syou).
Further more,the weight of the consignment is 220kg but I manage to pay 120kg, which cost US$7,600.00. On no account should you disclose the content of the crate with the Diplomatic Courier Services for fear of betrayal.So do not allow them to know that the content is money.
In the mean time,contact the shipping director on Telephone or E-mail him to send you the keys and shipment documents and to know also the actual situation with the consignment and re-confirm your address where the consignment will be delivered and then get back to me as soon as possible.
Mean while,I will be coming over to your country immediately the consignment arrives in your Country for my 10%share.
Best Regards,

So you don't even consider Cheney could be guilty? After all the "no bid" contracts? The soldiers getting electrocuted? The missing billions? The rip-offs? All the corruption charges against Halliburton from other countries? None of those matter?
 
 
The dark side is very elusive.
 
 
LOL!

Nigeria is going to get our former Vice President by using Interpol.

 

 

I thought retardean was stupid before I read this thread.

And, of course, that was obviously a correct conclusion.

But now, it's beyond inescapable.

<< pssssst.: retardean hates Dick Cheney. >>

Obama/Holder isn't pursuing anything either, and will not honor a warrant against a former Vice President.

No one thinks that he would. What it proves is the entire world thinks Dick Cheney is rotten. The only ones that don't are Republicans.

Has anyone noticed how Republicans take one position and the rest of the world takes another?

Considering that only 6% of American scientists are Republican, it suggests how likely the right is, well, "right".
 
 
Aren't the same people who're laughing at this calling for Interpol to apprehend Assange?

So we want Interpol to do its job when it's someone the talking heads tell us is the enemy?

We want people who actually commit crimes to be investigated and arrested by proper police authorities.

We do not want purely political judgments passed-off as law enforcement.

Is that really difficult for you to grasp?

Not surprisingly, JB, you are once again simply and utterly wrong. It is true.

And that's exactly why I don't want our former Vice President politically harassed by the retards over there in some poducnk fucking "nation" and why I am quite content with a hit being sanctioned for Assange.

A former cop I know suggested it should go down like this: green light; red mist.
 
 
This really adds credibility to Rdean 6% threads.

YOu want to only investigate the people who actually commit crimes?? How do you know who actually committed the crimes if you don't investigate?

And Interpol doesn't apprehend criminals.

I want the investigation to be for actual crimes, in the first place. And any of those podunk bullshit nations are always free to "investigate" whatever they choose to "investigate." A warrant to "arrest" our former V.P. is not needed for such an alleged "investigation," however. Surely, even a goober such as you has to be able to grasp THAT much.

And Interpol may not (themselves) be able to arrest anybody, but they can and do put out wanted cards and warrants upon which law enforcement authorities can make such arrests. So the distinction you quibble about is quite trivial. No surprise.

In response, Cheney hires a new lawyer to lead his defense team:

Maybe bribery isn't an actual crime in your world. But it would be a crime in many nations of this world.

That is a far cry from the claim that V.P. Cheney was involved in any alleged bribery over there. And, if a private citizen engages in conduct which could (in theory) make out the elements of that crime, that is not necessarily the same as one of the heads of state of a sovereign nation engaging in such alleged conduct.

If those same podunk accusers were to claim that Saint Obama of Hawaii had engaged in some conduct amounting to (in their humble estimation) "bribery," then you would ENDORSE an Interpol red card for the arrest of President Obama?

I guess I'll help the illiterate wingnut and point out that Cheney isn't being accused of bribery while he was VPOTUS. You either made that up, or are too dumb to know what Cheney is accused of doing, and when.

No. You are the wingnut, and in your world, based on your last incoherent but ultimately retarded post, it appears that you believe (you being a classic dumbass far left wingnut) that being charged with bribery is the same as having committed any crime. But you are indeed retarded and "  ."

Now I must give one to you. The allegations do seem to involve allegations of bribery that happened BEFORE Vice President Cheney became Vice President.

What do you imagine the statute of limitations is for the "crime(s)"
which are being considered as chargeable against Mr. Cheney?

As I said, I was obliged to give you one. It does appear that the allegations of bribery preceded Mr. Cheney's tenure as Vice President. You have my permission to quibble about HOW I agreed with you, but as everyone who isn't a fucking asshole (like you) can plainly see, I had just agreed with you on that point. You jerk-off.  

And I know that Statutes of Limitation vary from country to country, scum-sucker. Everyone knows that. Hell, even a retard like you has gathered as much. That's why I asked you to imagine what those Statute of Limitations might be. Let' me give you a hint, shit-muncher. It goes a little like this. I have very good reason to believe that the Nigerian FELONY of "treason" comes with a two year statute of limitation, So, now, given that morsel of information (which even a fubar like you should be able to verify pretty easily), does it seem likely to you that they made the statute of limitations for bribery and/or for "conspiracy" longer, the same length or shorter?

By the way, you incredible idiot, we all know that bribery is a real crime. What we don't know is whether Mr. Cheney was actually implicated in reality in any alleged Haliburton bribery over there in Nigeria. Once again (since you are truly quite stupid): there is a HUGE difference between some schmuck CLAIMING that Mr. Cheney committed a crime and Mr. Cheney actually having committed any crime. Anybody can SAY anything. hell, you've said all manner of stupid ass bullshit, but the fact that YOU make retarded claims doesn't make anything you say true in the real world, shit-breath.

Wrong. It does not merely "appear" that way; It *IS* that way. It has nothing to do with his actions as VP. You just can't admit it so you hide behind weasel words like "it appears"

WRT SoL's, there is actually NO LIMIT when the perp has taken actions to keep his crimes from being uncovered

 
Most jurisdictions provide that limitations are tolled under certain circumstances. Tolling will prevent the time for filing suit from running while the condition exists. Examples of such circumstances are if the aggrieved party (plaintiff) is a minor, or the plaintiff has filed a bankruptcy proceeding. In those instances, in most jurisdictions, the running of limitations is tolled until the circumstance (i.e., the injured party reaches majority in the former or the bankruptcy proceeding is concluded in the latter) no longer exists.

There may be a number of factors that will affect the tolling of a statute of limitations. In many cases, the discovery of the harm (as in a medical malpractice claim where the fact or the impact of the doctor's mistake is not immediately apparent) starts the statute running. In some jurisdictions the action is said to have not accrued until the harm is discovered ; in others, the action accrues when the malpractice occurs, but an action to redress the harm is tolled until the injured party discovers the harm.
 
And them there's the Continuing Violations Doctrine

 
Continuing violations doctrine
In tort law, if a defendant commits a series of illegal acts against another person, there is no statute of limitations. In the 8th Circuit case of Treanor v. MCI Telecommunications, Inc.', the court explained that the continuing violations doctrine "tolls the statute of limitations in situations where a continuing pattern forms due to [illegal] acts occurring over a period of time, as long as at least one incident of [tort] occurred within the limitations period."[1]

And in bribery cases, there is a potential for a civil case once (and if) Cheney is convicted.
 
You posted no exceptions to the Statute of Limitations in Nigerian Law. And the one effort you made directly addressing any "exception" to a Statute of Limitations addressed itself to a civil matter, not a criminal matter, in any event, in addition to the fact that you were discussing some U.S. law.

Your effort, as always = fail.

But feel free to try again.
 
 
 
 
 
Obama/Holder isn't pursuing anything either, and will not honor a warrant against a former Vice President.
 
No one thinks that he would. What it proves is the entire world thinks Dick Cheney is rotten. The only ones that don't are Republicans.

Has anyone noticed how Republicans take one position and the rest of the world takes another?

Considering that only 6% of American scientists are Republican, it suggests how likely the right is, well, "right".
 
What's your justification for that 6% number?
 
He really really really really wants it to be true...so it is!
 
 
 
 
 
YOu want to only investigate the people who actually commit crimes?? How do you know who actually committed the crimes if you don't investigate?

And Interpol doesn't apprehend criminals.
 
I want the investigation to be for actual crimes, in the first place. And any of those podunk bullshit nations are always free to "investigate" whatever they choose to "investigate." A warrant to "arrest" our former V.P. is not needed for such an alleged investigation," however. Surely, even a goober such as you has to be able to grasp THAT much.

And Interpol may not (themselves) be able to arrest anybody, but they can and do put out wanted cards and warrants upon which law enforcement authorities can make such arrests. So the distinction you quibble about is quite trivial. No surprise.
 
In wingnut world, bribery isn't an "actual crime"  
 
In moonbat world, being a conservative is a crime.
 
 
I have done a little more digging. It looks like Halliburtun agreed to an extension of the Statute of Limitations for an SEC investigation.

There is nothing to suggest that they offered to extend the Statute of Limitations for any Nigerian criminal investigation, however, and even if they did, there's no reason to believe their action could bind Mr. Cheney.

I see sanghahaha still can't advise anybody of what the relevant NIGERIAN Statute of Limitations for these alleged crimes would be.  

Real surprise.
 
 
 
 
 
As I said, it does appear that you got one right, and I had to give that one to you. So you have my ongoing permission to quibble stupidly about the manner in which I offered that honest concession.  

Your citation to matters of law that you have not the slightest ability to understand is appreciated since it underscores how ignorant you are.   But since you are retarded and woefully ignorant, I shall once again deign to provide you with a small tidbit of accurate information:

Of course the SoL is still in effect you moron. If it weren't, Interpol would have rejected the Nigerian request. And if Cheney weren't bound by this, then again, Interpol would not have honored the Nigerian request

You really have no idea of how Interpol works, do you? (Hint: They don't just do whatever some nation asks them to do.)

You don't even understand what Interpol does with a color-coded request, you fucking idiot.

In any event, the Statute of Limitations may or may not have run out already and nothing you have pointed to even begins to answer the question of whether it has or not. Your premise (retarded as always, you jerk-off) is that the Nigerian authority seeking to make a name for himself couldn't POSSIBLY have over-looked the Statute of Limitations or that (possibly) he's aware that it did already run out, but is not concerned with that aspect of the case provided he can generate a little ink.

Your always shallow "thinking" is a reflection of the fact that when it comes to guys like Vice President Cheney, assholes like you are always willing to give him the benefit of a presumption of guilt. This is why you are a scumbag hypocrite, a lowlife and need to go fuck yourself, sangasshole.

You are dumber than a box of dick cheese.

Once again, Interpol would refuse the Nigerian request if it had no legal authority to request it because the SoL had run out. You can't refute it, so now you're making up lies about how some unnamed Nigerian "authority" over-looked the law (don't suppose you have a link for your lie), do you?).

Cheney was found "not guilty" by the "Gonzales/Ashcroft" "Bush/Cheney" justice department. We all know how "honest" THAT administration was.

I challenged you to show us how the alleged "conspiracy" involving Vice President Cheney comported with the Nigerian Statute of Limitations in such criminal mattes.

You ducked.

Not unexpected.

Instead, you ask me to provide you with some proof that the fact that some Nigerian official is seeking to have Interpol issue a Red Card (or whatever color works these days in such cases) does NOT constitute proof that the Statute of Limitations issue is without merit.

You are a retard.

By the way, California Girl was right. Most people do laugh at you and recognize that you are a retard.

You can't back up any of the bullshit you spew.

You actually claim to believe that the mere fact that a Nigerian official is going to ask Interpol to secure a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Cheney constitutes evidence either that Mr. Cheney was actually involved in the alleged conspiracy OR that the Statute of Limitations applicable to such criminal charges in Nigeria has not yet run.

Interesting observation.

Google has many stories about how Nigeria is " to file" charges. And those stories (dated 12/1 and 12/2) advise us that he " will be charged within three days. "

Except, oops. Deadline came and went.

There is nothing reported to suggest that anything was actually filed as against Mr. Cheney.
 
 
Hey friends!

I share with you'll now an EASY breezy way to keep track of the non-indicted status of our former Vice President. Well, that's not quite accurate.

Instead, it's a way to keep track of WHEN, if ever, the Nigerians obtain a RED CARD from INTERPOL based on an allegedly filed Nigerian Indictment against our former Vice President.

Karl Rove got FROG MARCHED, today, after lengthy delays.

His LONG awaited Indictment, according to a red faced but unnamed Justice Department official, was "misplaced" when, after
the Grand Jury voted, somebody "and I'm not naming any names" decided there was time to order-in for lunch. "Between the paper bags, the napkins, the numerous open files on the desks and so forth," said the embarrassed career prosecutor, "the paperwork for the preparation of the Indictment against Mr. Rove got lost, temporarily."

"Temporarily" has been a couple of years, now.

In an arguably related story, Nigerian prosecutor Godwin Obla Wan Kenobi finally filed the Indictment against Mr. Cheney earlier today. The former Vice President, upon hearing the news, smiled his famous beatific smile (see photo) and was thought to have suggested that Obi Wan should go "fuck himself."

  Stock photo of the famous beatific Dick Cheney smile.

I know. But since somebody (and I won't mention any names     ) already made a connection between the EPIC thread concerning Rove and this thread concerning Vice President Halliburton -- er, I mean Cheney -- I am now concerned that if they got it wrong about the Cheney/Interpol Red Card, maybe the EPIC thread will prove to be wrong about the Rove Indictment.

Pay attention. Follow along.

This is important shit.

And yes, it WILL be on the test.
 
 
 
Indictments will be lodged in a Nigerian court “in the next three days,” Godwin Obla, prosecuting counsel at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, said in an interview today at his office in Abuja, the capital. An arrest warrant for Cheney “will be issued and transmitted through Interpol,” the world’s biggest international police organization, he said.

Obla said charges will be filed against current and former chief executive officers of Halliburton, including Cheney, who was CEO from 1995 to 2000, and its former unit KBR Inc., based in Houston, Texas; Technip SA, Europe’s second-largest oilfield- services provider; Eni SpA, Italy’s biggest oil company; and Saipem Construction Co., a unit of Eni. Obla didn’t identify the former officials whom he said held office when the alleged bribes were paid.

Just sayin'.

 Dick Cheney to be Indicted in Nigerian Bribery Case Task Force on Financial Integrity and Economic Development 
 
By the Nigerian government, one of THE most corrupt governments on the planet! Oh sure! ROFL Sorry, but this is going nowhere. Interpol will not do a damn thing about it and just because some corrupt regime issues an arrest warrant does not mean Interpol will honor it. Cheney will not answer and does not answer to the one of the most corrupt governments on earth and most of all, since he is in and out of the hospital with his heart problems, I doubt he is in any condition to risk his life with the suck ass health care system of Nigeria so that morons can pretend Nigeria's "judicial" system has any credibility in the first place! There was already an independent investigation into these specific events and Cheney was thoroughly cleared of any wrongdoing whatsoever by a very credible and impartial commission and also was investigated by an international panel with the same results. I trust THAT far more than I would ever trust the abusive, corrupt, filthy, repulsive, inhumane system that exists in Nigeria -much less pretend it is capable of coming to an honest, just result! This was done for the specific purpose of trying to embarrass the United States and Nigeria fully expects the leftwing extremist loons of the world to get all excited about it -like you did.

I notice that there are still leftwing extremist internet sites spewing all sorts of idiotic bullshit -like this one  http://www.usmessageboard.com/law-an...ent-last-year/  - that claimed in May of this year that Cheney's stock in Halliburton increased 3000% the previous year!!! Apparently they have no problem lying, knowing full well their cows would never take it upon themselves to do their own unbiased research for the facts -like the FACT that Cheney dumped all his Halliburton stock and ALL financial interest in the company before he accepted the VP position with Bush and everything the company owed him as part of his contract was paid off even before that and he was not paid even one cent more than what he contracted for. And he still has zero financial interests or holdings in Halliburton to this day. Oh darn, doesn't it just suck for liberals when reality bumps up against their fantasy life? ROFL
 
 
 
 
They're pretty smart, alright. Nigeria is the phishing and identity theft capital of the world.

What's the number for Interpol. I need to turn them in.
 
So you don't even consider Cheney could be guilty? After all the "no bid" contracts? The soldiers getting electrocuted? The missing billions? The rip-offs? All the corruption charges against Halliburton from other countries? None of those matter?
 
"The Clinton administration made the same calculation in its own dealings with Halliburton. The company had won the LOGCAP in 1992, then lost it in 1997. The Clinton administration nonetheless awarded a no-bid contract to Halliburton to continue its work in the Balkans supporting the U.S. peacekeeping mission there because it made little sense to change midstream. According to Byron York, Al Gore's reinventing-government panel even singled out Halliburton for praise for its military logistics work." - Rich Lowry, NRO

Actually, fuck you. Cheney was an evil man, who did things selfishly, but presented them as being patriotic and you dumbfucks actually bought because you are so fucking lost. He is also dishonest, and a liar to America and the world, who usurped vice presidential power to push through his own agenda. I hate him, he's a fagot, and an asshole, and a war criminal. How about no-bid contracts to his own fucking company, Halliburton, that made how much in Iraq, giving defective equipment to our troops? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? How about all of the no-bid contracts that were allowed in general, as someone already mentioned. That is treasonous enough, but no one cares. People still call him a patriot. Why? Because he has a mean look on his face and says "I hate terrorists." (paraphrased) They are only words. He's one of the worst so-called 'leaders' this country has ever seen. As far as I'm concerned. a real Benedict Arnold of our day. Fuck Cheney.

he had nothing to do with the company when he was VP
and Clinton did no bid contracts to them
 
 
Name another Company with the equipment and man power to perform the same job as Halliburton.
OH wait you can't there is only one that comes close and even they have trouble competing but let offer a bid to other companies to try. Hey maybe McDonald s or the evil Wal-mart can offer a bid and when they cant perform the job it will only costs millions to fix where they let off and can't wait to spend the time and money to let them bid and try.
You people just hate big companies and want to take there money why cause your to stupid to go make big money yourself not to mention you have regulated so much its nearly impossible for a start-up company to make it. it's pathetic to believe that there was a scandal here it would have been a waist of time and resources to bid on jobs that would have gone to Halliburton anyways. and this happened with the Dem's in office so let see ol' Billly bob Clinton up there with him

No no. You really need to go fuck yourself up your own anal pore with a rusty knife, you rancid douche bag.

Our former Vice President was and is a good and decent man.

Dumb fuckers like you are unable to get past the bullshit liberoidal propaganda long enough to realize how literally absurd it is.

So, eat shit, you uneducable retard, bark at the moon, hump the post man's leg and give yourself another round of fuck yourself with that rusty knife. In a million years you could never be a thousandth of the man Mr. Cheney is.

(By the way, since Bubba Clinton had no problem giving Halliburton no bid contracts, there's not a whole lot of reason to piss and moan about it. Eat another hefty shit sandwich you stupid piece of rat anus.)

 Dick Cheney Nigeria Bribery Charges Dropped 

Someone paid off the Nigerians

I wonder who that could be  
 
 
 
I think I saw he warrant on ebay along with one of their bank checks.  
 
Still there. No one seems interested...  
 
 
I received this in my inbox this morning:

 
Date 12-20-2010

FROM: Mr. Ben Ahore
Nigerian Treasury Department
Lagos, Nigeria

TO: Missourian
Address: Missouri

Dear Sir:

I have been requested by the Nigerian Department of Justice to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian Department of Justice has recently indicted the former Vice President of the United States. We are willing however, to void this indictment in exchange for your cooperation and assistance in freeing certain funds presently held by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.

You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian Treasury Department, and also the Nigerian Department of Justice, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian Treasury. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian Department of Justice would agree to allow a voiding of the indictment against Vice President Cheney.

However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US $100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.

If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian Department of Justice, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.

Please contact me at your earliest convenience by e-mail. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will issue an arrest warrant for Vice President Cheney, and the matter will be out of our hands.

Yours truly, etc.
Ben Ahore

No you didn't. You posted links that have reported people saying things.

People say things.

That proves nothing. Proof, you know? Money? Showing a bribe.

Rather than, this person said this about that person who did this....

OK  
 
 
It is well known that Nigeria is one of the most corrupt places on the planet.

It is a given that Halliburton paid a lot of money to secure the oil deal back when Mr. Cheney was the head man at Halliburton.

It is not known that Mr. Cheney was ever advised of this underhanded arrangement.

The indictment of Halliburton by Nigerian prosecutors concerned with Nigerian corruption is all well and good. But the effort to indict Mr. Cheney was obviously just a cheap, cheesy display of political expediency.

Now it does appear that there has been a resolution of the criminal charges. It kinda <<sniff sniff>> smells like a pay-off. Wouldn't that be ironic?

And even so, there's still not a shred, not an iota, not a dime's worth of evidence linking Vice President Cheney to any part of the original bribe OR to this latest "settlement" effort.

What we are left with, then, is just another urgent desire by sangha and his filthy ilk to engage in another smear. Thus, sangha = fail yet again.

We know that Haliburton bribed Nigerians while Cheney was the CEO

We know that Nigeria charged Cheney with a crime

We know that after Nigeria threatened to ask Interpol for an intl warrant, Halliburton "settled" by paying the Nigerians $250M to drop the charges

I'm sure that Halliburton paid all that money because it felt bad for those poor Nigerians.

ps - no one in this thread has said that Cheney was involved in the bribery. You just have to make up stuff, or you would have nothing to say

The CEO isn't said to have done anything criminal, except if you count the Nigerian government prosecutor's office, and that accusation was kinda the point of this thread, you retard.  

Also, I have little doubt (or proof for that matter) that Halliburton paid the bribe in the first place, but I see no reason why (assuming they did) they wouldn't accept the chance to pay a very large increased fine (i.e., a second bribe?) to "settle" the matter. And if that gets Vice President Cheney off the unfair "hook," that's so much the better (and probably served as a big inducement to "settle").

Hurry back and add something even more ridiculous the next time, Sangha. Your fails are fun!

Wow. ANOTHER sangasshole fail. This is fun to witness.

The CEO isn't said to have done anything criminal, except if you count the Nigerian government prosecutor's office, and that accusation was kinda the point of this thread, you retard.  

Also, I have little doubt (or proof for that matter) that Halliburton paid the bribe in the first place, but I see no reason why (assuming they did) they wouldn't accept the chance to pay a very large increased fine (i.e., a second bribe?) to "settle" the matter. And if that gets Vice President Cheney off the unfair "hook," that's so much the better (and probably served as a big inducement to "settle").

Hurry back and add something even more ridiculous the next time, Sangha. Your fails are fun!
 
Once again, the wingnuts prove that if they didn't lie, they'd have nothing to say

No one has said that. What I said is that "no one in this thread has said that Cheney was involved in the bribery"

Try again  
 
ANOTHER sangha fail. Pssst, stupid (that's you sangasshole): WHAT I NOTED WAS THAT THE NIGERIAN PROSECUTOR HAD made the allegation and that THAT was the "point" of this thread.

You, douchey, don't have to make any allegation against Mr. Cheney when you and your stupid ilk post this nonsense so approvingly.

You are a liar and pathetically stupid. everyone sees through you and the crap you post, scumbag.  
 
You are not only a liar, but a terrible liar. In a previous post, you said that *I* accussed Cheney of being involved. You're too much of a wuss to admit to it, so you're now going to pretend you never said it. Too bad it's right there in black and white. Here's what you said

 
And even so, there's still not a shred, not an iota, not a dime's worth of evidence linking Vice President Cheney to any part of the original bribe OR to this latest "settlement" effort.

What we are left with, then, is just another urgent desire by sangha and his filthy ilk to engage in another smear. Thus, sangha = fail yet again.
 
You want to accuse me of a smear to hide your own lies, but you can't quote me accusing Cheney of anything in this thread. It must be so frustrating for you to rely on such absurd lies that are so easily debunked
 
 
Are we going nuts? Are republican-haters willing to subject the former Vice \President of the United States to some INTeRPOL statute? We run INTERPOL. If the US stops funding for the agency it will dry up.

Who cares who runs interpol? If Cheney is guilty and interpol has the authority and ability to prosecute him... he will be prosecuted before the funding is pulled, even if that was to happen, which it wouldn't if Cheney was found to be guilty, because interpol would be vindicated.

Cheney has a better chance of being elected President than he does of ever being convicted of anything.

You know jack shit about Interpol. Just sayin'.
 
 
Too bad some shady organization didn't issue a death warrant for his lame ass. With a father like that, it's no wonder his daughter is a disgusting lesbian. Let the flame fest begin.

First of all, Cheney was indicted in Texas:

 Texas grand jury indicts Cheney, Gonzales of crime | Reuters 

[excerpt] (Reuters) - A grand jury in South Texas indicted U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and former attorney General Alberto Gonzales on Tuesday for "organized criminal activity" related to alleged abuse of inmates in private prisons.

The indictment has not been seen by a judge, who could dismiss it.

The grand jury in Willacy County, in the Rio Grande Valley near the U.S.-Mexico border, said Cheney is "profiteering from depriving human beings of their liberty," according to a copy of the indictment obtained by Reuters.

----------

I know now that Interpol can't be involved in anything political, so let's replace Interpol with an a Federal Grand Jury. The point is Cheney is a criminal, and anyone who believes otherwise is denying themselves truth. How about Halliburton's involvement with Iraq after being given no-bid contracts and making tremendous profits off of OUR tax dollars. Who gave them the no-bid contracts? Who reaped profits? You think Cheney had nothing to do with this? He is traitor in my book. Halliburton was even supplying faulty equipment, along with a few other traitorous corporations in Iraq, to our soldiers, resulting in their needless deaths. See "Iraq for Sale"  Iraq For Sale  (<--- click on this for link) This is only one example.
