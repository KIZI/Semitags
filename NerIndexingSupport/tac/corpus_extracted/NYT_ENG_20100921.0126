The Obama administration announced Tuesday that
average premiums paid by individuals for private Medicare Advantage
plans, which insure about one-fourth of all beneficiaries, would
decline slightly next year, even as insurers provide additional
benefits required by the new health care law.

By contrast, commercial insurance premiums for many people
younger than 65 and many small businesses are increasing 10 percent
to 25 percent or more. Insurers say that a significant share of the
increases is attributable to requirements of the new law, a
contention that infuriates Obama administration officials and
Democrats in Congress.

Many of the law's requirements take effect this week. President
Barack Obama plans Wednesday to highlight the potential benefits
for consumers.

The announcement on Medicare came as something of a surprise.
Some members of Congress and some health policy experts had
predicted that insurers would increase average premiums for
Medicare beneficiaries in private plans.

Insurers can begin marketing to beneficiaries Oct. 1 for
Medicare coverage that starts Jan. 1.

Medicare officials said they had held down premiums and
co-payments by negotiating with insurers, which sponsor the
Medicare Advantage plans.

The law, signed by Obama in March, gave officials new power to
negotiate and to reject bids, as they did in a few cases.

"We negotiated more aggressively than in the past," said
Jonathan D. Blum, deputy administrator of the Medicare agency. "As
a result, some plans changed their bids to produce more value for
beneficiaries.

"On average," Blum said, "Medicare Advantage premiums will be
1 percent lower in 2011 than today. Medicare Advantage plans
project that enrollment will increase by 5 percent in 2011."

About 11.3 million of the 46 million Medicare beneficiaries are
in private Medicare Advantage plans, which offer comprehensive care
in return for monthly premiums. While premiums for a particular
plan in a particular county may increase next year, beneficiaries
may be able to find other plans offering a better deal.

In the yearlong fight over health care, Obama said the
government was overpaying Medicare Advantage plans.

John K. Gorman, a former Medicare official who is now a
consultant with clients in the insurance industry, said: "Today's
announcement shows that there is a new sheriff in town. Medicare
officials were very specific and very forceful. Insurers succumbed
to the government's demands and stayed in the Medicare market
because they have become much more dependent on Medicare
business."

Payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans will generally be
frozen next year at 2010 levels, with rates subject to tighter
constraints in subsequent years. The cuts are expected to save $136
billion over 10 years.
