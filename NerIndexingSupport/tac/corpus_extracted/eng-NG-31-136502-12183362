Just received information from Accessible Arts regarding a Captioned
Film.

A special fundraiser screening of Australian documentary A Good Man
will take place on September 5. A Good Man, by Safina Uberoi, is the
true story of a struggling Australian farmer, his quadriplegic wife,
their newborn baby and their plans to open a brothel in a small
country town.

The film will be captioned for the hearing impaired and will be
followed by a Q&A with the film-makers. All proceeds from the
screening will go towards creating a fully accessible version of the
film with captions for the hearing impaired and audio-description for
the vision impaired.

A Good Man, co-winner of the Best Documentary Award at the recent
Sydney Film Festival, was described by the Festival jury as ‘a human
story of huge heart told with candour and humour.’

Accessible Arts is pleased to provide support and sector information
to the producers of A Good Man for: the incorporation of access
technology in the film; marketing to key organisations and for future
accessible screenings of A Good Man in cinemas and television.

When: 6:30pm Saturday 5 September

Where: The Chauvel Cinema, cnr Oxford st and Oatley rd, Paddington

Cost: $20/15

Bookings: Call 02 9361 5398 or online at www.chauvelcinema.com

Hi guys

We're excited to announce a new initiative and would encourage you to
participate:

A new online forum Australian Web Access Review (AWARe), launched today,
gives you an opportunity to have your say on the accessibility, or lack of
it, of prominent Australian websites. More importantly, users' feedback,
such as your own, will be used to help drive awareness of and improvements
to web access in Australia.

Created by Media Access Australia (MAA), AWARe is unique internationally in
the way it deals with the issue of web access.

"Up until now, it has been difficult for individuals with disabilities to
both demonstrate the inaccessibility of Government and Industry websites and
to make a change," says Scott Hollier, an expert on access to the Internet
for people with disabilities and New Media Project Manager at MAA.

"The AWARe site enables you to have your say and shows you're not the only
one facing web access issues; helping support change through real user
feedback."

As part of AWARe, you will have the opportunity to review 5 important
Australian websites per month, such as government websites, by answering
questions based on the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) internationally
recognised 2.0 accessibility standards, and to discuss their findings in an
online forum.

Review results are available for anyone to view and provide a breakdown of
the question results. MAA will also use its considerable experience in
constructive engagement with stakeholders to work with website owners and
developers to improve their website's acccessibility.

Have your say at www.aware.org.au
