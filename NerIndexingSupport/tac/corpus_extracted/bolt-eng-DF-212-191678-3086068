U.S. vs. Iran: India vs. Pakistan Anew?
By Mark Kukis/Baghdad

The scenario: Militants wage a proxy war for a budding nuclear power, pinning down a more formidable enemy army. If that appears to be the Iranian game-plan in Iraq, it isn't an original one. The paradigm for the emerging U.S.-Iranian contest has clear parallels with the struggle between Pakistan and India.

As early as 1990, a full eight years before the subcontinent went nuclear, Pakistani military leaders began to view the massive army India kept at the border less as potential invaders and more as a target. The likely reason: Islamabad felt empowered by its secret nuclear weapons program. Even as a hypothetical shield against Indian retaliation, it lessened the Pakistani military's sense of vulnerability. Soon, militants trained and armed by Pakistan began appearing in Indian territory in increasing numbers, and violence spiked. By 1998, when both India and Pakistan formally unveiled their nuclear arsenals, India and Pakistan showed how regional rivals could wage up-close, bloody struggles against each other  both in conventional and asymmetrical warfare  undeterred by the specter of a nuclear exchange.

The view from Tehran these days probably looks much like the view from Islamabad in the early 1990s. By most estimates, Iran is now roughly five years away from having nuclear weapons. The United States, a nuclear power and sworn enemy, has tens of thousands of troops at Iran's borders. The mullahs and military strategists in Tehran undoubtedly realize that they cannot defeat the U.S. forces arrayed against them, just as military leaders in Islamabad knew they could not beat the Indian forces at Pakistan's border. Courting all-out war is obviously a mistake for Iran. But so is doing nothing, as Washington increases the number of troops in Iraq and foments international opposition to Iran's nuclear program. Faced with such a situation, it's easy to see how hawkish elements of the Iranian government find the prospect of arming and training guerrillas in Iraq appealing. The expectation of having nuclear wapons just a few years from now  which would mean any strike against Iran could trigger retaliation against the attacker or its allies  may give Tehran's strategists a sense of confidence in supporting bolder and bolder assaults. It is, in effect, a nuclear umbrella under which Iran can sponsor guerrilla warfare.

U.S. military officials have aired their strongest accusations yet against Iran, saying 170 troops from the U.S.-led force in Iraq have died as a result of sophisticated bombs that could be traced back to Iran. The claim follows a string of incidents in Iraq involving suspected Iranian agents over the past two months. In December, American forces announced the capture of four Iranians, two of whom are thought to be members of the Quds Force, Iran's paramilitary arm around the Middle East. Then, on Jan. 11, U.S. forces in Iraq raided a house in Irbil, capturing a number of other alleged Iranian operatives. The U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, said one of the men arrested in that raid was the director of operations for the Quds Force. Many observers believe the Quds Force was responsible for an attack on U.S. troops Jan. 20 in Karbala, in which four American soldiers were kidnapped and murdered, though just who carried out the Karbala murders remains unclear.

All of this, combined with longstanding U.S. suspicions of Iran, are following the pattern of hostility between India and Pakistan, two countries who remain locked in a bloody struggle even now. Sometimes India and Pakistan fight each other directly with their militaries in border skirmishes and artillery duels. More often the fighting goes on as part of a kind of shadow war in which Indian forces struggle to capture and kill militants linked to Pakistan in various ways. The United States and Iran appear to be following a similar path together in Iraq.
 U.S. vs. Iran: India vs. Pakistan Anew? -- Printout -- TIME 
Isn't it something like Let's make our enemy bled to death with a thousand cuts? Something Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to do for quite a long time, bolstered with their confidence to deter India with their nukes?
 
 
I know this might sound stupid to most people, but..................
What would happen if the U.S. launched a massive cruise missile attack on Iran, that was covered from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, ect... and said it was a massive Shiite attack!!!?????
Or wait...........is Iran mostly Sunni or Shiite??? I can't tell anymore.........they just keep killing themselves....
I would love to see how the Iran news would respond!

A sensible strategy for Iran, with two problems.

First, their "nuclear shield" isn't a shield against the US... it is more of a liability (since it can't reach us, but increases the incentive to use excessive force or even nuclear weapons on them). Second, the US is not India. We could successfully strike at Iran with conventional means without waging war against them.

Okay! But what would that mean that US is not India? I mean...as far making surgical strikes on Pakistan through conventional means are concerned...India is very much capable of doing it....however the risk of that escalating into a full fledged war is also on the cards. But again...capabilities exist...not only against Pakistan...but any country in Gulf....though there are no reasons or needs.

You are missing the point...they don't need to strike at the mainland....they would invariably target the US installations and interests in the vicinity...in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Gulf, Saudi, probably Pakistan too...plus the Tanker Channel will also lure them....the US will have to amass a significantly big contingent if it intends to hold ground....that will also be a plum target. Even devices to the tune of 1-2 kilotons will serve their purpose.

First, we have patriot missile systems... air superiority from day one, and enough nukes to completely obliterate Iran.

If they manage to hit an HQ or logistics center with a nuke, we could (and might) wipe out the entire population of their country. Would they think it is worth it?

We are capable, but we do not have the political will to use that.
Having a capability and not using it when it needs, is as good as not having the capability.

That is only partly what I meant. The reason why India doesn't have the will to do it is that such an operation is almost certain to escalate to a full fledged war, perhaps a nuclear one.... for India the stakes of such a contest against Pakistan are far higher than they would be for the US against Iran.

I agree with you on the present day scenario.
In the past, when both India and Pakistan didn't had nukes, India did not show political will to carry out such operations.
 
 
Pakistan is a military which is trained in exactly our way with the british legacy and are half a million in numbers, with fairly sophisticated weapons thrown here and there. Ofcourse we would have won, not without some large casualities. Our political will was detered because of this. We are a dharmic hippie peacenik gandhian nation, which has been our undoing in the past, and I see that changing and this definitly India's century

Comparing the Pakistani army to the rag-tag arabian 'shiny' army is a disgrace to our enemy. We should know better than that.
 
 
US will be in the same tight corner viz a viz India with Pakistan. Even though Iran cannot target US, it can and will target US allies in the region. With the oil price shooting up and with indigenous local industry, Iran is no puppet state like Venezuela, they've got enough cash. But, only time can tell, whether US has the political will and ambition to hold Iran for extended period of time.

We aren't going to conquer Iran. Occupying (as opposed to conquering, which we could do) a nation of 66 million with a great deal of mountainous terrain and a series of large cities would require a lot of political will and a conscript army... neither of which will happen.

Fortunately we wouldn't have to do that. We can dismantle Iran's industry with a concerted air campaign.... especially their all important oil industry, that is especially vulnerable from the air. And if nukes come into the picture, as was suggested above, we aren't like India (who is far closer to Pakistan in terms of strength than we are to Iran). We can use nuclear weapons and take all of Iran in a first strike (against us they don't have a second strike capability).
 
 
 
what the heck?

 

What the heck??!!!!

I was only stating that the U.S. forces have intelligence on Iranian forces trying to, or instruct to, kill U.S., and Allied forces in suicide bombings!!!!!!!!!
Thats all!!!!!! But obviously Iran continues to deny such actions!
My, simple response was............."I wonder what Iran would do in a unforeseen cruise missile attack thats all!!!???""
Is there a problem with that???????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If so tell us???!

You dont even know wether Iran is Shia or Sunni?

As it might sound...I would not get into a war depending upon Patriotic or whatever anti missile system. And they lobbing nukes is a moot point...something that I myself confronted some threads back. They won't do that...they are intelligent enough to assess the retaliation that would follow.
But they will respond....if nuked(assuming they do have the stuff).
You said "they can't reach us". Agreed, only that they don't need to.
They have enough range to reach your vital installations in the region and also your allys. Now with the Nuke factor taken out...what do you do?
Start carpet bombing their entire military-industrial complex and nuclear facilities? Good one....Do it! And Do it Fast! No one knows how far they are from criticality. Just that we want to sit back and enjoy the firework.  
 
 
Major,

A few things here. The Iranians do not have a nuke yet. It will be at least another 2 years before they could get one... assuming that nothing would go wrong... and things have as of this date.

A credible delivery vehicle is even further away. The best in the foreseeable future is a freight aircraft of sorts doing a suicidal run. Good luck in trying to penetrate any decent air screen or ground based AD.

So, you're assuming capabilities that are not there.
 
 
The US would win in a round-robin single elimination tournament.

Until the Death Star came into the Milky Way and started destroying moons and planets, then we will all become Storm Troopers.

I wasn't claiming that the patriot's (or Arrow's, in Israel's case) would be an assurance to us, I was thinking more along the lines of deterrents to them.

 
But they will respond....if nuked(assuming they do have the stuff).
 

We don't need to use nuclear weapons first, however if we did I am reasonably confident that we could destroy most means of delivery that Iran will have devised by that time.... until they get an SSBN (they don't even have nukes yet, so many years from now) they aren't going to have a second strike capability (no middle weight nuclear power without SSBN's really has a credible second strike capability against the US or Russia).

 
You said "they can't reach us". Agreed, only that they don't need to.
They have enough range to reach your vital installations in the region and also your allys.
 

Would the Iranians take solace in the knowledge that they killed hundreds of thousands/millions of fellow Muslims in exchange for their annihilation?

Why wouldnt they treat any muslim helping Americans as an enemy
Saudi, Israel, Qatar, Baharin and Kuwait. They all have majority sunni populations also.

Because first, it would mean the quite probable destruction of the only nation where Shia's have an undisputed majority... and second, if the Iranians were portraying it as a holy war (which they probably would), it may very result in the extermination of Shi'ism everywhere as the Sunni's launch a holy war of their own in response.

According to the scenario, they are already going to be destroyed, so why care especially when they have nukes on an IRBM.

Do you think they would just sit and take it, when Americans launch operations from Qatar and Saudi., Saddam didnt. Why would the Iranians then.

Who said anything about American first use? Israel may initiate first use (because they can't mount an effective conventional attack) but we have no need. And they don't have nukes on IRBM, and probably won't for some time. However if they did we have missile systems that can take them down in addition to almost assumed air superiority, so even that isn't a sure thing.

If Iran nukes our allies in retaliation for a conventional conflict, they are going to get a major backlash from the rest of the Muslim world. With Saddam there was not the Shia-Sunni split complicating things. An Iranian war against the United States would be acceptable to most Muslims (who would support Iran)... Iran nuking Sunni Muslim nations (and populations) in retaliation for American actions would not.

Remember the reason our Middle Eastern allies didn't want us to go all the way to Baghdad in Desert Storm (and the reason why they all supported him in the Iran-Iraq War). Saddam's Iraq served as a useful buffer between the Sunni states and Iran. The Sunni governments (both secular and monarchical) fear Iran because it is large, subject to no-one but itself, is potentially wealthy (were its government to use a bit more common sense), and very radical. And Shia. If it absorbed the Shia portion of Iraq it would be even more threatening.

I dont share your optimism, If Iran had a nukes, and mostly they will not try aircraft drop, because it will be shot down for sure. They already have IRBM which reaches till Israel, and covers all of the Middle East. I dont understand, When saudi's, Iraqi's and Qatari's allow Americans to to start a campign from their soil. I dont think Iran will take that lightly, and they will just randomly fire missile's.
 
 
They have no nukes that fit on a rocket.

Sir,

Who doesnt, Israel?I presume. Iran has none as of now.

Scenario:
Iran has nukes and they can be Missile mounted,

Israel sees a threat, American goes into neutralize,

How will the Iranians respond, they know they will get defeated, What will be their course of action. Fly Scuds like Saddam did to Saudi, Kuwait and Israel.

I don't recall that being part of the assumption.

For a while after the Iranians develop nuclear weapons they are only going to have large, unwieldy devices. Then they have to come up with a missile able to mount a nuclear warhead (American and Soviet missiles are specially designed to fit nuclear warheads). Once they have that, they need to make sure that the missile is performing to specs (namely that it won't be easy to shoot down). This took the US and the Soviets many years to do, with far larger scientific bases and quantities of money than the Iranians can provide.

If it was aircraft delieverd, why are even discussing?   We all know what is going to happen.

So do the Chinese, Indians, Pakistani's, Brits, French

 
Once they have that, they need to make sure that the missile is performing to specs (namely that it won't be easy to shoot down).
 

If at all end is near, I dont think they will be bothered about CEP, rather shoot everywhere the US is or their allies are.

 
This took the US and the Soviets many years to do, with far larger scientific bases and quantities of money than the Iranians can provide.
 

This is not the 1950's, Iran wont take that much time.
 
 
 
If it was aircraft delieverd, why are even discussing?   We all know what is going to happen.

 

Iran has a wide variety of options other than missiles and aircraft for nuclear delivery. However even with intermediate range missiles, they still encounter the problem that both we and the Israeli's have the ability to shoot them down, and/or hit the launchers. So they get one first strike, and that is pretty much all they can get without having to rely on luck and luck alone.

 
So do the Chinese, Indians, Pakistani's, Brits, French
 

Yes indeed. The Chinese did it with Soviet help, the British with American assistance (we had a joint program), and for the French it consumed a large quantity of their defense budget for many years.

 
If at all end is near, I dont think they will be bothered about CEP, rather shoot everywhere the US is or their allies are.
 

You think they will be able to get that many nukes before coming up with a reliable missile? Because if they aren't worrying about CEP, then they will only be able to hit cities effectively and reliably... cities full of Sunni Muslims (perhaps Europe, but presumably our missile shield will make that an unreliable proposition).

Besides, most of the Iranian problem revolves around making their nukes smaller. If they can put a satellite into orbit then they can make a missile capable of carrying large nukes.

 
This is not the 1950's, Iran wont take that much time.
 

Iran also has a fraction of the resources that the US and the Soviets did... so I am not so sure that they will be faster.

Especially if they become an international pariah, something the Iranian President seems intent on turning his nation into.
 
 
 
If Iran had a nukes, and mostly they will not try aircraft drop, because it will be shot down for sure.

 

If they have no effective delivery systems, or if their delivery systems are out-of-order; they will turn to aircraft delivered. As did Pakistan during Kargil; or so I read.

Hi! Colonel
Hope U R keeping fine...was away for a while...but I 'm back...battery recharged.  

I'm not assuming anything. We all know that they are sometimes away from getting a deliverable device, that's the reason I said that if US/NATO wants to do something, they should do it fast.Why wait for the added botheration of having to manage contigencies of shooting down a raw nuke or may be even a dirty bomb?
In any case, even if they have it they are not idiots to go for a first use. However in this scenario where they HAVE it and either the US or Israel goes for a first strike(Very Improbable...fallouts will be devastating in the region and the allys) there is less chances that the Iranians will have a second strike capability.
What I'm bothered is...Lets consider that the US delays the action...Iran assembles few, war starts and US decides to go for compete win and possibly regime change... What will the clergy decide...sit down and take a devastating conventional punch OR fire all they have on the US interests and allys? Knowing that its anyhow their end...I have a notion that they would try that...whether they will be successful is a different equation.

However...I am deviating. I was debating on one ground that India should keep away from the scene of action. It's not our war...and the US doesn't needs us in the case of Iran.
 
 
 
I wasn't claiming that the patriot's (or Arrow's, in Israel's case) would be an assurance to us, I was thinking more along the lines of deterrents to them.

 

I'm not saying that you claimed...I just said that when I prepare for a war and do scenario building...I will always keep the odds against me and then make contingencies. Why start assuming that my deterrence is full proof?
Okay that Iran hasn't got a deliverable nuke as of now. But if you delay and they assemble few then you will aggrevate your problems in having to plan for deterrence. So my two cents is... If you have to shoot, shoot, Don't Talk.  

 
We don't need to use nuclear weapons first, however if we did I am reasonably confident that we could destroy most means of delivery that Iran will have devised by that time.... until they get an SSBN (they don't even have nukes yet, so many years from now) they aren't going to have a second strike capability (no middle weight nuclear power without SSBN's really has a credible second strike capability against the US or Russia).
 

IMHO the US won't nuke Iran nor will allow Israel to do so. The fallouts will be deadly for US allys in the region. Second it will be a first strike against a non-nuclear state...US won't repeat Japan. So the question of a second strike capability doesn't arise.

 
Would the Iranians take solace in the knowledge that they killed hundreds of thousands/millions of fellow Muslims in exchange for their annihilation?
 

War is Raw...when your nation state is getting annihilated...you don't give a damn for others...Muslims or no Muslims. They have done this with Iraq...for EIGHT Years...killing fellow Muslims...as Yes! as Adux said...in any case they will be killing Sunnis. No big deal.
 
 
 
They have no nukes that fit on a rocket.

 

Don't wait till they get one. Shoot Don't Talk.  
And keep India out.   )   )   )
 
 
 
And they don't have nukes on IRBM, and probably won't for some time. However if they did we have missile systems that can take them down in addition to almost assumed air superiority, so even that isn't a sure thing.

 

 
If Iran nukes our allies in retaliation for a conventional conflict, they are going to get a major backlash from the rest of the Muslim world.
 

When you are so sure that EVEN IF Iran did have Nukes and EVEN delivery systems, they still can't score a hit on US or its allys and even otherwise they won't do it fearing severe backlash from the rest of Muslim world......
Why is the US so bothered about Iran going nuclear?  
Relax and Enjoy your drink dear.   ) Let those stupid Iranians keep building it...they can't deliver it anyway.:P

We've done that before. We may still do so, but I'm getting a little tired of being policeman of the world... and I think most Americans are as well.

 
IMHO the US won't nuke Iran nor will allow Israel to do so. The fallouts will be deadly for US allys in the region. Second it will be a first strike against a non-nuclear state...US won't repeat Japan. So the question of a second strike capability doesn't arise.
 

I don't think the US will nuke Iran out of the blue either... but a major air campaign against their infrastructure may very well happen. We did it a couple of times to Iraq in the 1990's with far less provocation.

And the Israeli's might. You seem to think that we have some kind of control over Israeli foreign policy. There is another thread around here somewhere where I complain that our 3 billion dollars a year gives us no control. I have very limited confidence in our ability to restrain them.

 
War is Raw...when your nation state is getting annihilated...you don't give a damn for others...Muslims or no Muslims. They have done this with Iraq...for EIGHT Years...killing fellow Muslims...as Yes! as Adux said...in any case they will be killing Sunnis. No big deal.
 

It will be when they would be destroyed in response... moreso than it would be for a Sunni nation.

After all, Iran is the only state with a secure Shia majority. If that state is destroyed and the Sunnis work to kill the Shia's throughout the rest of the Muslim world in retaliation... well that sect of Islam will be destroyed.
 
 
 
When you are so sure that EVEN IF Iran did have Nukes and EVEN delivery systems, they still can't score a hit on US or its allys and even otherwise they won't do it fearing severe backlash from the rest of Muslim world......

Hey, I never said that they couldn't deliver it... I said that in a full fledged nuclear war they would lose. The Israeli's would "win" such a conflict (in the sense that they would survive)... however they definitely think that such a conflict shouldn't be allowed to occur in the first place, and I agree.

However the biggest danger isn't Iran trying to use nuclear weapons out of the blue, it is the arms race that would cause. Iran possesses nukes, how many Sunni nations will want them? Israel will have conniptions, and with nuclear weapons and a small population that makes things very dangerous.

At that point peace in the middle east is at the mercy of whichever leader/country is least stable. Given the history of the middle east, do you think this scenario, playing out over much of the industrialized worlds oil supply, is a good one for the world?

If you don't mind my saying so, you sound like you can't wait for the fireworks to begin.   ) War has almost become a spectator sport.

I think you are dead right. The American people will not stand for a first strike against Iran or, for that matter, any country, unless is can be demonstrated beyond any doubt that it was justly pre-emptive. Anyway, the US does not have to use nukes to cut off Iran's legs. Rattle its windows enough and Iran will begin thinking how best to survive. I believe it's crucial that US tactics leave room for Iran to retreat and save its governmental apparatus. If it lashes out blindly in every direction striking everywhere there is a McDinald's, it will only invite more devastation on itself which, in turn. could lead to a loss of public support.

 
War is Raw...when your nation state is getting annihilated...you don't give a damn for others...Muslims or no Muslims. They have done this with Iraq...for EIGHT Years...killing fellow Muslims...as Yes! as Adux said...in any case they will be killing Sunnis. No big deal.
 

I think that depends on the mindset of the leadership, but the US and its allies had better be ready for just such a tantrum by Iran.

Without a completely non-nuclear middle east which includes the Israeli's, iran will never stop their nuclear ambitions. Its crystal clear.

If the Americans have to take them down, it has to be in the next 2-3 years. Otherwise a Nuclear Iran is inevitable.

I think you are dead right. The American people will not stand for a first strike against Iran or, for that matter, any country, unless is can be demonstrated beyond any doubt that it was justly pre-emptive.
 

True,

 
Anyway, the US does not have to use nukes to cut off Iran's legs.
 

True

 
Rattle its windows enough and Iran will begin thinking how best to survive.
 

You underestimate their resolve and their idoitic at times sense of pride over practicality. Nothing will achieveed with boots on the ground. ie Regime Change.

I believe it's crucial that US tactics leave room for Iran to retreat and save its governmental apparatus. If it lashes out blindly in every direction striking everywhere there is a McDinald's, it will only invite more devastation on itself which, in turn. could lead to a loss of public support.

 
I think that depends on the mindset of the leadership, but the US and its allies had better be ready for just such a tantrum by Iran.
 

Saddam did, and he was sunni albiet ba'athist. And he sent his scuds left and right. Expect Iran to do it, if they have nukes, they will lob at everything and anything, if their existence is threatened.

I see a ray of hope, If America can make an example of Iraq, make it a great nation as it has helped South Korea, I am not taking Japan and Germany as they were already well on their way. I can see a definite shia tilt towards the Americans, anyways America's real enemies are not shia's rather saudi wahaabi's,

Delta hit the nail on the head a few posts back when he said something to the effect that a military planner assumes the odds are against him and plans for every contingency. But by the same token it is not wise to eliminate contingencies for peace. When I said "...it's crucial that US tactics leave room for Iran to retreat and save its governmental apparatus", I did not mean that this is a demarcation line. I meant it was an opportunity offered in the course of events. It would be short-lived if Iran fell to beating its chest and calling on the spirit of Darius to rise up and smote the infidels...or some such illogical attempt at self-immolation.

I'd expect them to fire on Israel at a minimum--Qutar, UAE, SA...also are possibilities. No nuke possibilities unless this all happens 5 years hence.

Diplomacy, But unless they see Israel loose some points Iran wont be happy enough to trust the US.

 
I believe that's the plan.
 

It is good plan, but the problem is time is not on our side, Iran will become nuclear by then. We loose our complete control of the situation.

And I sternly believe diplomacy will do a better work, its all about perception. America has to change how it is viewed in Iran. AIPAC will go nuts with that. But then again, its balancing act between World interest, American interest and Israeli interest. One has to wiegh and find out which is not balanced.
 
 
 
We've done that before. We may still do so, but I'm getting a little tired of being policeman of the world... and I think most Americans are as well.

 

I Agree!

 
However the biggest danger isn't Iran trying to use nuclear weapons out of the blue, it is the arms race that would cause. Iran possesses nukes, how many Sunni nations will want them? Israel will have conniptions, and with nuclear weapons and a small population that makes things very dangerous.

 

I Disagree. Big Time.
What makes you think that Iran's possession of Nuclear Weapons, is more tempting for Sunni nation's want for the same, than Israel. Remember an average Muslim's preferences always tilts to another Muslim...Shia's or whatever. Come to India, we house the second biggest muslim populace. They are always bickering amongst themselves...but come a communal riot with the others...and they are all united. Nuclear Iran is a lesser evil to an average Sunni than a Nuclear Israel. So if Israel's possession has not triggered an arms race, Iran's possession won't. Guaranteed. However Nukes to most of the third world countries are like sex to an impoverised bachelor. You simply can not get rid of the desire for it....so surprises if some of the Gulf Countries keep the desire.

I think that you and I are going to have to agree to disagree, because this isn't the way I see it at all.

The Muslim states of the middle east hate Israel, but for the most part they (the ones that have the resources for nukes anyways) don't fear Israel, because Israel's 5 million Jewish population cannot occupy them, or really even overthrow their government.

Put simply, Israel is a threat, but not it doesn't have the population or appeal to domestic Islamic militants that Iran does (as an example more than a controller). And then there is the Shia population that each Sunni nation possesses... always a possible source of friction, and danger to the ruling clique.

 
However Nukes to most of the third world countries are like sex to an impoverised bachelor. You simply can not get rid of the desire for it....so surprises if some of the Gulf Countries keep the desire.
 

Saudi Arabia, one of the wealthy nations of the Middle East with the most cause to fear Iran, would have a great deal of incentive to seek nuclear weapons if Iran acquired them. Egypt would also wish to look more closely at making such acquisitions, simply to maintain its regional power status.

Israel's current foes (Syria and Lebanon) don't have the resources to become nuclear powers, and most of the rest aren't completely opposed to Israel's existence any more. However with a nuclear Iran, who could blame the Sunni nations with the ability to acquire nukes to begin to attempt to do so?

Iran's concern is a nuclear Israel, which will motivate them to go nuclear. I personally think they are on the path to nuclearization. And I agree with your views Sunni's are more concerned with a strong shia's rather than Israeli's.

Even though as you said Israel cant occupy these countries, Israel have been given them outright defeats, have the scared the crap out of these people. They believe Israel got everything running for them and have a lack of trust in their own Generals. And a nuclear Israel add's to their woe's.

Simply put, the whole arab world in some sub-consicious way is afraid of Israel's resolve, talent, history, international appeal, technology and military capacity.

But a nuclear Israel is nothing new. Israel has probably had nuclear capabilities for many years, so I don't see a nuclear Israel as likely to provoke an arms race among Sunni nations (it hasn't yet).

True, but I am talking more about the governments (who make the decision to pursue nuclear weapons) than the people (who are a bit less rational and less easily mobilized against other Muslims).

We had ties with Iraq, and that didn't stop it from pursuing nuclear capabilities, just as we have had ties with Taiwan, and South Korea (both of whom have periodically attempted to become nuclear powers). Israel did destroy Iraq's attempt, however I really don't think blaming the US for proliferation is fair or accurate.

I still don't see it. Egypt and Saudi Arabia have had the resources to pursue nuclear weapons for quite some time. North Korea has been trying for many years... Iran is also a nation that will pursue nuclear weapons regardless of attempts to engage it (after all, look at their government... both the President and the Ayatollahs). However Iran never once fought Israel, whereas Egypt has in four separate wars. So I don't see how Israel is a catalyst for Iran and not Egypt.

Warmonger, you'll be surprised to know that the Saud's already have their hands on nuclear technology. Who do you think funded Pakistan's "Islamic bomb"? I believe Pakistan even has a deal with the Saudis about possibly transferring the nukes to the kingdom incase of outside aggression. Infact, I believe a couple of years ago, German intelligence even reported Pak scientists coming to Saudi Arabia to assist in providing nuclear know-how.

 
In 1971 Nixon help produce the Smiling Buddha in 1974  

 

Actually, Indian nuclear program is much older. And China was the reason India produced the Smiling Buddha. India started building the bomb as soon as China tested theirs.

Yes, Iran can prove to a catalyst for any Shia fiasco in the Sunni nations. However...I still have doubts that the Sunni nations will start an WMD arms race if Iran gets one.

You cannot seriously tell me that it was due to America which India produced the Smilling Buddha. You are talking a 3 years span; it took much longer to build it than 3 years. India had started working on the bomb as soon as the Chinese tested their first one in 1964. Ten years later, India tested its own.
 
 
Tronic,

The nuclear program was started after Chinese explosion, but the decision to test the device came into effect, after Indira Gandhi got uneasy about the ease with which Americans sent their 7th fleet to Bay of Bengal. Nixon made Indira so uncomfortable, she suspected some kind of action on India by the Nixon Administration. Diego Garcia (suicide...lol)Plans is suspected to have been drawn up because of this.

West was against India's invasion of East Pakistan,

Listen to Indira Gandhi running around the world for support, amazing politican.

Any proof of this or is it mere speculation? India had been uneasy from the day China tested their first nuke. Even the Smiling Buddha project I believe was started around 1967.

Read it up here first

 Smiling Buddha - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 
On September 7, 1972, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave authorization to the scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) to manufacture the nuclear device they had designed and prepare it for a test. Throughout its development, the device was formally called the "Peaceful Nuclear Explosive", but it was usually referred to as the Smiling Buddha.

 
 
 
 
Check when the decision to weaponize was made.

Read it up here first

 Smiling Buddha - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 

That still doesn't tell me that the decision to weaponize was made because of a percieved US threat. From the same link you provided me;

 
The project employed no more than 75 scientists and engineers from 1967-1974.
 

Don't tell me that the scientists knew that 4 years into the future, US and India will be at a war footing. The bomb was on the designing board long before the US fleet sailed into the Bay of Bengal. The authorization to manufacture and test the bomb was made in 1972; the project to design the bomb had already started 5 years prior to that. India started building the bomb after the Chinese explosion; but you still have yet to prove that the decision to test was due to the US. Or are you telling me that Smiling Buddha would never have been tested had the US fleet not sailed into the Bay of Bengal? If so then feel free to provide links or proofs why you feel so.
 
 
TRONIC,

Read it properly, Its there for you to see, dont go in circles.

1967 - Decision to make a nuclear program - Because of China
1972- Decision to make a nuclear bomb- Because of USA

There is a difference between both the decision.

Does this mean nor was there any intention to lob one at the Chinese or Americans, Nor did we have the capability. It was termed a Peaceful Nuclear explosion but it was used to drive a point. You have to understand Indira Gandhi to understand why that is.

there, and it is also avialable on the net.
Manufacture means - To make.

It is the same Iranian, Iran has a nuclear program which may or may not lead to nuclear weapon, Making the decision to weaponize is a huge thing to do.

let me check for the US link, Food for thought
which nuclear power threated us just a year before the decision to make a nuclear bomb was made.

No, you're wrong.

India's nuclear program did not start in 1967. India's nuclear program goes back to the early 1950s. The nuclear bomb, Smiling Buddha, project started in 1967. And I have already said this in my previous posts, so will not bother to repeat again.

Adux, I cannot argue any further. The Smiling Buddha is older then 1972 is fact. The bomb was being designed even as far back as 1964-65 is also a fact. That Indira Gandhi only gave authorization to test the bomb is due to a percieved threat from the US is mere speculation. You have yet to prove this. No, Indira Gandhi authorizing in 1972 for testing the bomb, which was being designed for more then 5 years, is not evidence enough that it was due to an American threat. You have any official reports, or even Indira Gandhi's own statements which lead you to believe that India's nuke was to specifically deter the US? If so, please post. Other then that, nothing but pure speculation.
 
 
Adux,

Tronic is right. In fact, the atomic program was started way early in the late 40s and early 50s. When China invaded India and tested her nuclear bomb, Shastri launched a clandestine nuclear weapons program. There was no way in hell that you could create a nuclear bomb design in two years. The bomb design started around the mid 60s and once they settled on a design, they continued to fine tune it waiting for the go ahead which Indira gave.
 
 
 
Yes, Iran can prove to a catalyst for any Shia fiasco in the Sunni nations. However...I still have doubts that the Sunni nations will start an WMD arms race if Iran gets one.

 

That is only part of why the Sunni's fear Iran. The other part is that Iran's government gives their own domestic Islamists (the Sunni/Wahabi ones) an example to strive for.

 
Example 1...The Arabs have known it for quite sometimes that Iran is pursuing Nukes or may be are already sitting on one, but they still have not started an arms race.
 

For a few years now at any rate. As has been said, the Saudis have attempted to secure an indirect capability by helping to finance Pakistan's nuclear deterrent (unsuccessful, as that program has required China's assistance) without alienating their alliance with the United States. I believe that Egypt (I read it in some news service, I think the BBC, if I find the link I will post it) is also attempting to build nuclear power facilities with French help... a step on the road to being a nuclear capable state.

 
Example 2...Iraq had the sourest relations with the Iraninas...Saddam also knew that Iran has plans for going nuclear...but now after the US over run him...we have not found any evidence to prove that Saddam had the plans or resources for a Sunni Atom Bomb.
 

To be fair, after the Israeli's took out Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 Saddam was somewhat distracted by other things, and then fairly isolated. Not a typical case.

 
Saudis already have an understanding of deploying Pakistani Nuclear Missiles in case Iran upps the ante. Source -
 

As OoE said, given the amount of Chinese aid that they have required, and the American assistance given to the Pakistanis on the control mechanisms for their nuclear forces, I doubt that the Pakistani government would find it easy to give any nukes to Saudi Arabia.
 
 
 
No, you're wrong.

Indian civlian program started before not the military one. What you had since 1967 cannot be compared to whatever was happening before. The Nuclear weapons program started in 1967, it says so in all the documents you get on the net. The crude-design was available before 1972, the decision to make one(the most important of all).

 
Adux, I cannot argue any further. The Smiling Buddha is older then 1972 is fact. The bomb was being designed even as far back as 1964-65 is also a fact.

There was nothing we could have done to the Americans then, there is nothing we could do now. It was all about making a statement. You have to understand Indira Gandhi. A woman even after Op.Bluestar insisted she will not discriminate between her countrymen and kept her Sikh gaurds, We all know what happened next.
Diego Garcia plans was something Capt.Lemontree talked about in this board and I wouldnt be suprised if it all there was one.

 
You have any official reports, or even Indira Gandhi's own statements which lead you to believe that India's nuke was to specifically deter the US? If so, please post. Other then that, nothing but pure speculation
 

You dont understand the mentality of the people at that point of time nor Indira Gandhi, India was attacked by Pakistan in 65, Given a thrashing by China in 62 and again attacked by Pakistan in 71 and threatened by another N-5 in 71. Nuclear Explosion in 1974 was about making a statement. If the nuke design was READY in 65 why expolde it only a decade later.

Adux, Please stop this. Don't argue further...because your premises are ABSOLUTELY wrong.

It is established beyond doubt that both Pokhran-I in 1974 and Pokhran-II in 1998 were staged for reasons of domestic politics in folie de grandeur which also inspired P. V. Narasimha Rao's aborted venture in 1996 on the eve of the 1996 Lok Sabha elections.
The politicians are not the only ones to be blamed for the folie de grandeur. The strategic enclave of scientists,technologists has driven India's quest for nuclear weapon capability. Beginning with Homi Bhabha in the late 1940s, all other leading scientists and engineers pressed political leaders to accelerate the development and demonstration of nuclear weapon capabilities. This process peaked once in 1974 when the top scientists persuaded Indira Gandhi to authorise the nuclear test at Pokhran.
Atomic Energy Commission and Defence Research and Development Organisation scientists subsequently pressed for additional tests and other steps to develop a nuclear arsenal but Indira was effectively restrained due to mounting international pressure and rebuke.
The possibility that India might go into the nuclear weapons business was noted by Isador Rabi, Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, as far back as in 1955. The American policy at that time was even more confused and incoherent, they knew India was inching close to weaponisation, they even tried to bargain....for example...during U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's visit to India in October 1974, an attempt was made to arrive at a compromise. The U.S., without reducing its own arsenal, would restrain India from acquiring one, while accepting the fait accompli of Pokhran in realpolitik.In any case, they wanted India to consider allowing 'external safeguards' on all its chemical reprocessing plants to 'establish the amount of plutonium produced and account for the disposition of such plutonium.' The Americans emphasised that this 'would not preclude the use of this material as necessary for designated explosives applications,' a position that would have set blood boiling in nonproliferation activists in Washington. The proposals reflected the Kissinger team's insight that pressuring India not to conduct further tests could 'strengthen public support for future tests.'... Kissinger then offered to send U.S. nuclear experts quietly to India to work with Indian scientists to ensure that nuclear materials and potential explosive devices would be managed with a premium on safety and international security. To this end, he proposed that the two states conduct a quiet dialogue on nuclear issues.
There is every reason to believe that, despite all the talk of morality and expression of horrow, both Jawaharlal Nehru and Homi Bhabha moved discreetly to acquire a nuclear option for its eventual exercise. Nehru's letter to Defence Minister Baldev Singh on February 29, 1948, clearly suggested that. Bhabha's and Nehru hoped to launch India into the upper ranks of modern, powerful states. Bhabha's plans in the mid 1950s to acquire weapon-grade plutonium, kept free from international safeguards.Nehru and Bhabha's subtle invocation of India's latent nuclear weapon capability as a deterrent, in 1960. Lal Bahadur Shastri's compromise with Bhabha to allow initial work on peaceful nuclear explosives in the aftermath of China's nuclear test in 1964
all suggest that the entirre project was for military might and well underway...something that you are unnecessarily debating. Then Bhabha's successor, Vikram Sarabhai, tried to stop studies on nuclear explosives and Indira Gandhi concentrated on domestic challenges while India struggled to effect a nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty that would commit the world to nuclear disarmament. The course twisted back in early 1966 when a handful of scientists and engineers took the initiative to reinvigorate nuclear explosive design work. In late 1970 and 1971, Indira Gandhi indicated that India was interested in conducting peaceful nuclear explosions. In 1972, after victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war, she opted to proceed toward conducting a nuclear explosion, which occurred finally in 1974 and this had nothing to do with the USS Enterprise.

The Nuclear weapon was never much of a talk in the Indian political scene. Granted it was one of the points in the NDA agenda. Indian military nuclear program was started in 1967, so says lot of the links available on the net. For all the talk politics, you all fail to analyze Indira Gandhi. She is the one who authourized DRDO, BARC to built a device.

Adu,
I don't have any ignorance about the Lady's character, What I insist is, the program was always military in nature. Bhabha and Nehru both knew the reality of the program and DESIRED for an Indian Bomb. Get it and get it very clear. However, the decission to go critical and detonate was due to a combination of two elements...Pressure from the R&D Engineers and the Political will of Indira Gandhi due to domestic reasons...a polpularist agenda.
Nothing to do with the US or the 7th Fleet.

You'r assertion that Nehru had a military idea is kind of 'doesnt hold water' in my opinion. Here is a man, who was regarded as the person who destroyed the Indian military apparatus, and now he is the one who began the Indian military nuclear program?????? Heck he declined a N-5 security council offer to the Chinese, as he considered them better to represent Asain continent,

 
He points out to a historic debt China owes India.

China managed a seat in the Security Council only because India, when invited to join the Security Council in 1955, declined in favor of its bigger neighbor.

"The first step to be taken is for China to take her rightful place, and then the question of India might be discussed separately," India's then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru wrote in a letter to the country's top political leaders – explaining why he supported Beijing.

Tell me what were the domestic reasons which compelled her to detonate the device?

The threat level to state of India, at the ease with which they operated in the Bay of Bengal, send jitters into the Indian spine. With the constant threat of Chinese, Pakistani's and an American President who clearly considered Indian Prime Minister Old Witch.

You can understand Indira exactly how she thinks from 1.40, and if you check her facial expression at at 1.53, it says YOU GOT OWNED!!!!..lol

Don't mix up things. If you want to discuss Nehru's decission "not to join the P-5" and how he is the "Destroyer of Indian Military"...open up a new thread.
And Now...Nehru was an idealist, who liked to day dream, not a traitor in my opinion....And YES...He and Dr. Bhabha are the actaual people behind the thing that Mrs. Gandhi decided to detonate some years later.

Did I say compelled???
I said the domestic reason was a popularistic appeal within the nations political echelion, coupled with the frezied pressure from the design engineers and scientists.

As I have said before...Out of Context and irrelevant. Period.
