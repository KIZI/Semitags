The French Cultural Center (CCF) in Libreville and the National Cinematography
Center (CENACI) of Gabon will stage the fourth edition of the "distinct
documentaries in Libreville" on Friday.

CCF Director in Libreville Guy Lacroix told a press conference on Wednesday that
the "distinct documentaries in Libreville" is a project aimed at promoting and
arousing interest in Africa's documentary films, especially those of Gabon.

For seven days, about 20 documentary films will be projected to the Gabonese
public and entry will be free.

"The documentary films to be projected during the occasion has never been
watched by the Gabonese public," Lacroix said.

The festival for "distinct documentaries in Libreville", whose last edition took
