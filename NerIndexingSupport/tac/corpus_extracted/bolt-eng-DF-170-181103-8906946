We shall see.

There are no rules of procedure any more in WI. I'm not yet convinced he isn't setting a trap.
 
 
Depends on how you look at it. From one perspective, he caves. From another, he's playing the polls, by appearing to have offered compromises, thus making the Dems look bad.
 
 
The WI 14 should not agree to anything unless Walker and the Senate GOP send 5 GOP Senators to Illinois to assure there wont be any funny stuff when they come back.
 
 
I hope he makes cheese out of all the Democrats...

Un-be-fucking-lievable.
 
 
 
The WI 14 should not agree to anything unless Walker and the Senate GOP send 5 GOP Senators to Illinois to assure there wont be any funny stuff when they come back.

 

Exactly. The governor has proven beyond all reasonable doubt that he cannot be trusted.

The Dems have looked bad all along. Walker had my support because he had stuck to his guns. Now, it APPEARS he is reacting to polls, like a typical politician.

He has? How is that exactly? Walker has openly stated what he wants from day one. It was the cowardly Dems who took flight and went into hiding...

He may be. He may not be. I don't have enough hard fact to know either way. I'm highly entertained by the claims of 'beyond reasonable doubt' though. That's some hysterical unthinking claptrap right there.

For saying he thought about planting troublemakers in the crowd for starters. For publicly saying he wouldn't negogiate while privately doing so for seconds.
 
 
Assuming that he is actually interested in compromising on this issue; there goes ANY chance he had at nomination for a National Office. His own party would eat him alive.

It's the Democrats who have stuck to their guns, and because they did, they bought enough time for everyone to see where the People are on these issues,

overwhelmingly in support of collective bargaining rights.

And this makes him worse than the cowardly Democrats who fled the state in an attempt to get out of doing their jobs, and will probably charge the state for their lodging, meal and travel expenses if they ever get the courage to come home? Bullshit.

And are "the people" ready for a tax increase to help pay for said bargaining rights for state employees?
 
 
So lets see, he doesnt compromise and he's "standing on principal" but when he caves hes "showing up the dems"....

Man, there is just no wrong in the Republican party

Told ya he would. The GOP always caves. Of course, it's also a demonstration of leadership. He recognizes he is getting the bulk of what he wants and so he is accepting that rather than continuing to drag out a political football that is ripping the state apart.

On the other hand, Walker probably has nothing to lose by sticking to his guns and continuing not to compromise. You can be assured the recall efforts are still going to go forward and the unions will do everything in their power to defeat him for reelection as well as the Republican reps next year who voted for it. In that respect, they may as well stick it out at this point.
 
 
Pretty typical of the left.

They SCREECHED for weeks that Walker wouldn't COMPROMISE.

Then when he thinks about it they turn around and call it CAVING IN.

I know the left does it everytime

 Obama firing up Gitmo again. 

whoops!  
 
 
Yeah. He can't be trusted especially after he spilled the beans during that crank phone-call where he thought he was speaking to the Koch bro' & got punked LOL.
 
 
That's a shame.

A good man forced to do what he hopes is the lesser of 2 evils.
Since the flee party pussies won't return, he had to face the fact that he will have to lay-off 1500 people.
Being to humane to do that, since the flee party pussies didn't come back.

He now has to deal with criminals like they are upstanding citizens.

I hope it is a trap to put those pussies in jail and force them to vote. They were willing to piss on 1500 of thier own citizens instead of do thier job.

And the libs here are cheering for them.

Telling, very telling indeed.
 
 
Compromise. When did that become a dirty word? The problem with politics today is the inability to compromise. It is the only way to get things done, to discuss and work toward something that everybody can support.

When people do not compromise the losing party feels left out or injured and bitter feelings arise and this is what has happened on the national level and is filtering down to the states. We are all in this thing together so why can we not work together and find solutions instead of name calling and "if your not with me your my enemy" mentality.
 
 
Well someone FORGOT to teach the 14 Democrat FLEEBAGGERS how to Compromise.

But Now as we see, the LEFT will hold them up as CHAMPIONS for abandoning their JOBS and their constituents WHO WEREN'T IN A UNION.

pathetic if you ask me. No wonder so many people have no morals or ethics anymore.
 
 
 
Depends on how you look at it. From one perspective, he caves. From another, he's playing the polls, by appearing to have offered compromises, thus making the Dems look bad.

 

He is losing in the polls. Repugs in Wisconsin are facing recall.

Walker the Wanker is caving pure and simple.

So much for the threads about Wanker and the Repugs winning.
 
 
They better insist that Walker/the Koch Bros. minion put his intentions in writing
 
 
LOL, Republicans are facing recall...WELL so are the Demorats Fleebaggers.
 
 
Doesnt sound like hes giving up much of anything to me

Well said. It has been said that politics is the art of compromise. Lately in America politics has become the act of posturing. Too bad so many on this thread fail to grasp this.

And Vise-Versa....considering who is pulling the funny stuff after all  
 
 
If it is a trap, and Walker simply says "Fuck You" when the runaways return.....how quickly will they try to claim the moral high ground?

Don't forget for looking for his bonus trip to California paid for by the Koch brothers.
 
 
In the article it says the compromise is inadequate for the Dems.

Dishonest ameoba like MORON, first you bitch cause Walker was UnCompromising and now you bitch cause he is compromising. you need to eat some worm poop.
 
 
 
oh brother.

 

Compromise is for people who don't actually believe what they claim to believe, Stephanie. Sorry, but I'm not interested in seeing any more candidates with phony-bologna, plastic banana, good-time rock & roll campaign platforms that they don't actually believe in and aren't actually willing to live up to. If your BIOGRAPHY and VOTING RECORD can't stand up to you CAMPAIGN PLATFORM get the hell out of the way and let someone who can actually WALK the TALK take the reins.

That's why I couldn't vote for McShame and his Alaskan Teddy Bear in 2008. Hell, given only the choices of McShame and Obimbo, and forced to vote for one I'd have chosen Obimbo. At least HE was honest about who and what he was, unlike McShame and the Alaskan Teddy Bear. I ended up voting for Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party instead.

Democrats are facing recall as well and I would hardly call this a win for the Democrats or the unions. Walker is still getting the bulk of what he wants. Nobody has really "won" here, but objective and rational people are able to see that, unlike the petty partisan drones out there.

Agreed. The Repubs have been going right faster than the Dem's ahve been going left. All you have to do is look at the last election. Their mantra was "moderate like Castle in Delaware?, get rid of him" All thanks to the tea partiers LOL. Governing IS about compromise contrary to what the the extreme righties on the board think.

Pretty well, actually. I've got the more obvious moron in the White House, driving himself closer and closer to a one term Presidency every day. We have the beginnings of Revolution formenting in the streets and the ale houses of this nation on a daily basis. We have people finally opening their eyes to the fact that NEITHER political party is worth anything.

Sometimes you have to throw the cannon fodder out in front of the big guns and sacrifice something to further your cause. The years 2008-2012 have been sacrificed in order to hopefully further that cause. We may have to sacrifice 2012-2016 as well, but hopefully by 2016 we'll be ready for the REAL CHANGE you can believe in.... The one that returns this country to its roots of proper governance and society. We've started slowly down that road already.

Liberals are so screwed up, but we already knew they didn't give a damn about the budget, they are the "gimmmie gimmie crowd" after all.

Horse*bleep*.

Believe it or not there ARE those of us who stand by something called PRINCIPLES in our lives. These concepts are not changeable or ignoreable for us. They are simply a matter of RIGHT vs. WRONG. There is no middle ground.

For us what you're suggesting is tantamount to asking someone who is deathly allergic to even the smallest amount of shellfish to "just have one" shrimp instead of eating the entire appetizer plate full of them.

Walker says he will have to lay off 1500 people if the fleers don't return
The fleers call his bluff
Walker caves and invites them to the table
Fleers say screw you and thost 1500 people
1500 people will vote GOP next time, cuz Walker will have to now.
 
 
 
Doesnt sound like hes giving up much of anything to me

 

I agree. Sounds like he's throwing them a tiny bone. Lets see what they do with it.

The gutless Dems in WI should all be recalled. These guys were elected to conduct the business of WI. All of WI. Not just the Union members.

As for recalling Walker. Lets pose a question to the citizens of WI.

Hey. Do you want your taxes raised to support collective bargaining for the Public Sector workers??

Bet that one ain't on any poll.

I think they think they got a foot in the door so they want to see if they can get the whole enchilada. Its payback to the Unions after all..

Your right. This is the real test. I hope Walker tells em all to go to hell and holds his ground.

I would answer that if I mentioned the flee party hating democracy....  
 
 
 
 
The WI 14 should not agree to anything unless Walker and the Senate GOP send 5 GOP Senators to Illinois to assure there wont be any funny stuff when they come back.

 

And Vise-Versa....considering who is pulling the funny stuff after all  

 

The thing is by his own words they can't trust Walker. However, he can allow a Dem majority in the state to pass a compromised bill without fear because if they do anything funny he has the power of the veto.

The 14 cannot say the same.

If I were them I would do nothing until some GOP Senators are far from that State.
 
 
 
 
 
The Dems have looked bad all along. Walker had my support because he had stuck to his guns. Now, it APPEARS he is reacting to polls, like a typical politician.

 

It's the Democrats who have stuck to their guns, and because they did, they bought enough time for everyone to see where the People are on these issues,

overwhelmingly in support of collective bargaining rights.

 

And are "the people" ready for a tax increase to help pay for said bargaining rights for state employees?

 

This isn't about the budget. The unions offered their share of the budgetary concessions. That was the end of that part of the issue.

But since you are such a nice guy, I will re-word;

How does obama not closing gitmo compare to the WI situation?

Closing gitmo was a horrible idea by a person that had no actual idea what was going on and how important gitmo is.
The other is a Gov having to deal with a bunch of cowardly sissies that refuse to do the job they are paid for.

You see my confusion on how they relate.
 
 
 
 
MADISON, Wis.  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has offered to keep certain collective bargaining rights in place for state workers in a proposed compromise aimed at ending a nearly three-week standoff with absent Senate Democrats, according to e-mails released Tuesday by his office.

He moved the needle in the right direction. That's a good thing. Thumbs up to him.
 
 
I think the Right is frankly stunned at the amount of nationwide support for unions/collective bargaining rights in this country...

...I think the Right got fooled by their own propagandists into believing that unions were overwhelmingly reviled by the American people.

I think it's more a matter that the Republicans (who are not right-wingers for the most part) thought that the Democrats were just going to roll over and play dead. They didn't believe that the Dems had the intestinal fortitude to actually pick up their ball and go home.

Now, I would suggest the first thing the WI needs to do is to change their laws to indicate that a simple Quarum (one more than half the assembly) is needed to conduct business, to ensure that neither party can do this again in the future; but that's hindsight.

One side or the other is going to come out of this mess in WI smelling like roses. The other side will come out smelling like manure. It's all going to depend on the PR battle and what the majority of the consituents in the state really believe. Only time will tell which side will be which.

Understood...

See it seems that many conservatives / republicans here do not like the fact that "liberals" wanted Walker to change then when he does they say he's caving in

Compare that to Republicans / Conservatives did not like the fact that Obama said he was going to close Gitmo, now that he's changed they say he's caving in

Both are caving, but conservatives want see Walkers caving as compromising (good thing) and see Obamas compromising as lying to his constituents (bad thing)

See..

But since you are such a nice guy, I will re-word;

How does obama not closing gitmo compare to the WI situation?

Closing gitmo was a horrible idea by a person that had no actual idea what was going on and how important gitmo is.
The other is a Gov having to deal with a bunch of cowardly sissies that refuse to do the job they are paid for.

You see my confusion on how they relate.

 

Understood...

See it seems that many conservatives / republicans here do not like the fact that "liberals" wanted Walker to change then when he does they say he's caving in

Compare that to Republicans / Conservatives did not like the fact that Obama said he was going to close Gitmo, now that he's changed they say he's caving in

Both are caving, but conservatives want see Walkers caving as compromising (good thing) and see Obamas compromising as lying to his constituents (bad thing)

See..

 

Crap, outta rep, I shall return.

That's the partisan sword stabbing.

In reality, obama figured out gitmo was a good idea and waited until the situation died down so it could pass under the radar (for the most part). I wouldn't call it a compromise, I'd call it learning a hard truth.

Walker is stuck. Nothing can and will get done unless the flee baggers return and stop holding up democracy. It's clear he was bluffing when he said he would lay off 1500. My guess is that the dems don't give a damn about that as long as the union supports them.
 
 
Anyway we can keep them out of state for another 2 weeks?

I'd be happy to donate to a fund to make sure they don't come back till after their automatic recall and replacement
 
 
 
Under the compromise floated by Walker and detailed in the e-mails, workers would be able to continue bargaining over their salaries with no limit, a change from his original plan that banned negotiated salary increases beyond inflation. He also proposed compromises allowing collective bargaining to stay in place on mandatory overtime, performance bonuses, hazardous duty pay and classroom size for teachers.

 

Lookie very carefully at what they DID not get to keep: Benefits. Salary is NOT benefits. The key provision that is causing the problem in WI, Pensions and Healthcare is removed from collective bargaining.

Niiiiiice.

And the union and fleebaggers already refused.
 
 
Rather than who caved and who won, I rather see that the ending result is something that reflects the needed changes that most agree need to be done and that the taxpayers are benefiting from the changes.

Are poor teachers going to be fired as they should be if they were in a private business?

Are teachers going to pay more toward their benefits as they should since the taxpayers are paying their salaries?

Are small class sizes going to be protected? Are equipment going to be available and repaired?

Will evaluations be fair and done by outside personnel, void of political pressure?

Are teachers going to be allowed to vote if they want to be part of a union?

Can union dues be paid without it being taken out of the checks automatically?

And, can taxpayers be sure the state legislature will continue to do their jobs without running to an adjoining state if they appear to be losing a vote?

That's amazing. Maybe they will still be on vacation when the recall is done.
 
 
 
 
I think the Right is frankly stunned at the amount of nationwide support for unions/collective bargaining rights in this country...

...I think the Right got fooled by their own propagandists into believing that unions were overwhelmingly reviled by the American people.

 

I think it's more a matter that the Republicans (who are not right-wingers for the most part) thought that the Democrats were just going to roll over and play dead. They didn't believe that the Dems had the intestinal fortitude to actually pick up their ball and go home.

 

I can't say as I'd blame them if they thought that. Too many Democrats aren't fighters. People died for workers' rights in the history of this country. Living out of state for awhile is a relatively small sacrifice.

They always have. I dare you or anyone to show me any contract anywhere that says they can't.

 
Are teachers going to pay more toward their benefits as they should since the taxpayers are paying their salaries?

 

Yes. They will pay more out of their pockets from a salary that starts around $25,000 a year. (Great pay for a job that requires a dregree, eh?)

 
Are small class sizes going to be protected? Are equipment going to be available and repaired?

 

Probably not since the GOP in Wisconsin shows how little regard they have for education and those things cost lots of money. And if you think education costs lots of money you should try ignorance.

 
Will evaluations be fair and done by outside personnel, void of political pressure?

 

Suuuure it will. Uh-huh. Just trust them.  

 
Are teachers going to be allowed to vote if they want to be part of a union?

 

Why vote? In Illinois it's an individual decision.

 
Can union dues be paid without it being taken out of the checks automatically?

 

Hopefully not but either way doesn't matter. The GOP has done more to strengthen Unions in the past month that the Dems ever did.

 
And, can taxpayers be sure the state legislature will continue to do their jobs without running to an adjoining state if they appear to be losing a vote?

 

Since the VAST MAJORITY of voters side with the Unions in this issue I would think that they would want and expect the Dems to do everything in their power to stop what Walker and the GOP is doing.
 
 
 
Are teachers going to pay more toward their benefits as they should since the taxpayers are paying their salaries?

 

 tax.com: Really Bad Reporting in Wisconsin: Who 'Contributes' to Public Workers' Pensions? 
Out of every dollar that funds Wisconsin' s pension and health insurance plans for state workers, 100 cents comes from the state workers.

How can that be? Because the "contributions" consist of money that employees chose to take as deferred wages – as pensions when they retire – rather than take immediately in cash. The same is true with the health care plan. If this were not so a serious crime would be taking place, the gift of public funds rather than payment for services.

...

The fact is that all of the money going into these plans belongs to the workers because it is part of the compensation of the state workers. The fact is that the state workers negotiate their total compensation, which they then divvy up between cash wages, paid vacations, health insurance and, yes, pensions. Since the Wisconsin government workers collectively bargained for their compensation, all of the compensation they have bargained for is part of their pay and thus only the workers contribute to the pension plan. This is an indisputable fact.
 
 
 
The left are getting all faux outraged again. I like Walker, just for that.

 

Yes, we know your philosophy: Party First, Country Second.
 
 
Wait, Gitmo is still open?

So, what you are saying, is that they yearly pension is actually part of the compensation they were paid while working, just "deferred" for retirement, correct? That means, if the bewginning salary is $25,000, and the first year of retirement will be $60,000, the first year teacher is being compensated $85,000, only $60,000 is deferred is she stays long
enough for retirement. And say her thirtieth year her salary is $75,000 but she is actually compensated $140, 000 to give her one year of retirement later on. Wow.

That doesn't even include the paid vacations and health insurance.

That would explain why Reagan headed one.
 
 
I was a teacher, and if I recall, I paid 6% of my salary into my reirement and the board matched it double with 12%. It was then put in the stock market and investments and that is how the money grew.

When I had to go on retirement/disability, I had a choice of a monthly income or a lump sum of $778,000.

It used to be that teachers could be paid for unused sick days and receive checks for a few thousand dollars on top of retirement. Some states may still have that.

Exactly. The governor has proven beyond all reasonable doubt that he cannot be trusted.

Of which here in Wisconsin we refer to them as "FLEEBAGGERS."

The article speaks for itself. I don't know what the actual numbers are. Benefits are part of the total compensation package that's bargained for, not something separate. How can these teachers contribute more towards their benefits if they're already contributing 100 cents of every dollar? That's the answer-as-a-question to your initial question I quoted.

MADISON, Wis.  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has offered to keep certain collective bargaining rights in place for state workers in a proposed compromise aimed at ending a nearly three-week standoff with absent Senate Democrats, according to e-mails released Tuesday by his office.

wait, hasnt that been his position all along?
that ONLY parts of collective bargaining were being removed?
 
 
 
 
Depends on how you look at it. From one perspective, he caves. From another, he's playing the polls, by appearing to have offered compromises, thus making the Dems look bad.

 

The Dems have looked bad all along. Walker had my support because he had stuck to his guns. Now, it APPEARS he is reacting to polls, like a typical politician.

 

no, this is looking more like MEDIA SPIN

Is Gov. Scott Walker's offer enough for a deal with rogue 'Wisconsin 14'?

Governor Walker has released emails with some of the absentee 'Wisconsin 14' that show he's willing to compromise  on some issues, to some extent.

By Peter Grier, Staff writer
posted March 9, 2011 at 1:53 pm EST

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has said for weeks that hes not willing to budge on the parts of his budget bill that would strip most Badger State public unions of their collective bargaining power. But now it turns out thats not entirely true  he is willing to compromise, after all. Is he giving up enough so that Wisconsins union standoff can be settled via a deal?

Lets examine possible answers to that question by going to the emails (pdf).

First, a little background. On Tuesday, Governor Walker released to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel a chain of emails that show hes offered to dial back a bit on his anti-union efforts. The emails were sent to some of the Wisconsin 14  the Democratic state senators who have fled to Illinois to block a vote on this whole thing.

Among key changes, Walkers offer would allow public unions to bargain over salaries with no dollar limit. In his budget bill, he had banned negotiations over anything but increases that keep up with inflation.

Walker also says that hed let unions continue to bargain over mandatory overtime, performance bonuses, hazardous duty pay, and classroom size for teachers, among other things.

Only one of the Wisconsin 14 has to return for the state Senate to muster a quorum and return to work. And several of the rogue Democrats say that Walker's offer is enough to keep them talking  though its not enough yet to get them to give up the dubious comfort of a hotel bed in Illinois.

Im more than willing to continue to work through this if there is willingness on the other side, said Democratic state Sen. Bob Jauch.

There are several obvious points to make here. First, now that the details of a possible compromise are public, the pressure on both sides to reach a deal will ratchet up. Some Wisconsin Democrats are worried that they increasingly look like a party thats standing in the way of the democratic process. Some Wisconsin Republicans are worried that they increasingly look like a party bent on destroying unions at all costs.

So if a deal is to be made, Walkers offer likely will likely be the draft from which it is derived...

In November 1986, it was disclosed that the Reagan administration had been bargaining with terrorists by selling arms to Iran. Reagan went on television and vehemently denied that any such sale had occurred. He retracted this statement a week later, insisting that the sale of weapons had not been an arms-for-hostages deal. In March 1987, Reagan was forced to issue a second retraction, admitting that the deal had been arms-for-hostages after all.

Governing IS about compromise contrary to what the the extreme righties on the board think.

 

Horse*bleep*.

Believe it or not there ARE those of us who stand by something called PRINCIPLES in our lives. These concepts are not changeable or ignoreable for us. They are simply a matter of RIGHT vs. WRONG. There is no middle ground.

For us what you're suggesting is tantamount to asking someone who is deathly allergic to even the smallest amount of shellfish to "just have one" shrimp instead of eating the entire appetizer plate full of them.

 

This is politics, not medicine. You are not standing on principles, but rather your political opinion.

MADISON, Wis.  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has offered to keep certain collective bargaining rights in place for state workers in a proposed compromise aimed at ending a nearly three-week standoff with absent Senate Democrats, according to e-mails released Tuesday by his office.

But courage. It has been my experience that those who need somebody--a face--to blame for all of Americans problems, sins, and shortcomings can only manage to remember so many names. So the more there are the more difficult it becomes for the blame throwers. And when we gradually restore fiscal sanity to the system, there could be some bright enough to begin to see all this as a good thing.

Meanwhile, we have Harry Reid crying about cutting $69 billion out of the $3.8 trillion dollar budget because it could mean Nevada won't have their Cowboy Poetry Festival?

That's what we're up against folks.

In November 1986, it was disclosed that the Reagan administration had been bargaining with terrorists by selling arms to Iran. Reagan went on television and vehemently denied that any such sale had occurred. He retracted this statement a week later, insisting that the sale of weapons had not been an arms-for-hostages deal. In March 1987, Reagan was forced to issue a second retraction, admitting that the deal had been arms-for-hostages after all.

Enough of this stupid, loony left, anarchist protesting is enough. They lost, now go the fuck home and shut the fuck up. Normal, decent people are sick and damn tired of watching it and listening to it. Fucking socialist pieces of shit.

They won't get away with it for long. If the police don't remove them, the National Guard will be called in. I'm hearing that they're all packed into the halls outside the assembly hall vowing not to leave. That is illegal. They are blocking access to the hall and disrupting the work that needs to be done. They're banging on doors, pounding on windows and screaming through bull horns. This is all illegal, and I don't think it's going to be allowed to go on for long.

Where is all the talk of obstuctionist now. Isn't that what republicans were called when they dissagreed and were in the minority?
 
 
Check this out. Move on.org, what a bunch of nuts. Dream on you leftwing nutjobs

Dear MoveOn member,
Minutes ago, Wisconsin Republicans made a shocking power grab—ramming through their partisan attack on workers' rights without a single Democrat present.

It's shameful, unprecedented, and probably illegal. We can't let them get away with this.

We have to recall the Republican state senators who did this.

Progressives in Wisconsin have already gathered thousands of signatures to do just that, but they need our help to get the job done. Let's send a clear message that trying to destroy the American Dream is a surefire way to get booted from office.

Can you help raise $500,000 tonight for the recall efforts, to make sure these senators lose their seats over their outrageous actions?

What happened?

With the Wisconsin 14 out of state for weeks, Republicans have been unable to jam through Governor Walker's bill taking away union rights from public workers.

But tonight, the Republicans decided to use the nuclear option. After modestly changing the Governor's budget bill, they "declared" that it was a different kind of bill that they could pass without the Democrats and passed it—all in a half-hour.1

Thousands of Wisconsinites have already flooded the capitol and will occupy it overnight. And Wisconsin Democrats are already exploring legal challenges to stop the law. But it's up to the rest of us to make sure that these senators pay a heavy price for their actions, so everyone gets the message: Attack workers and middle class families, and there will be consequences.

Help raise $500,000 tonight to send these Republicans packing:

It shouldn't. Yes they have the right to protest peacefully. That does not include destruction and disruption. It's a crime what they get away with.

 

They won't get away with it for long. If the police don't remove them, the National Guard will be called in. I'm hearing that they're all packed into the halls outside the assembly hall vowing not to leave. That is illegal. They are blocking access to the hall and disrupting the work that needs to be done. They're banging on doors, pounding on windows and screaming through bull horns. This is all illegal, and I don't think it's going to be allowed to go on for long.

Could you imagine if the Tea Party was doing this? Hell the freakin' left would be FOAMING AT THE MOUTH WITH GLEE, and it would be on EVERY CHANNEL, EVERY NEWS PAPER and IN EVERY MAGAZINE. Just another example of BLATANT left wing HYPOCRISY.

 

Not only that, but if it was the Tea Party we would be seeing post after post from the left feigning mock outrage, disgust, and contempt as they accuse the Tea Party of all manner of thuggery and worse. But if it's unions doing it......free speech.

And frankly, I have a hard time accepting that kind of double standard as honest, much less intelligent or fair.

This whole Obama administration is living breathing hypocricy
 
 
 
 
 
In your dreams Scooter......

 The Ronald Reagan Years - The Real Reagan Record 

.

 

what the FUCK does that have to do with sending in thugs to disrupt a peaceful protest?

NOTHING

damn, you are too fucking stupid

 

"Nothing" is right you dumbass. But I wasn't commenting on that.

 
NYcarbineer.....For publicly saying he wouldn't negogiate while privately doing so

Charles_Main....Yes how horrible of him to consider doing something Liberals do all the time

DiveCon....yeah, to "think about it" but not actually do it

Dagoose.... Unlike Reagan who actually did

Divecon.....liar

Dagoose....In November 1986, it was disclosed that the Reagan administration had been bargaining with terrorists by selling arms to Iran.

 

 

which again, has nothing to do with what was the subject you ignorant pos
 
 
 
If these boards had a Circle Jerk sub-forum, this thread would go in it. Might even be a "sticky".

 

and it would be subtitled the bode zone
 
 
 
 
 
They have run out of civil options and reason so they turn to disruption and destruction

 

Which shouldn't be an option at all, even though it's time for them to all go home.

True. If Union Representatives had shown up dressed appropriately and holding signs stating their concerns and opinions instead of hateful rhetoric and personal attacks, had behaved themselves and left the premises clean and in good repair as the Tea Partiers, 9/12ers, tax protesters, and similar groups do, I would have no problem with that. I might even afford them some respect for excercising their civil rights and expressing their opinion even though I have to disagree with them.

But these union thugs aren't doing that are they? $7.5 million in damages several days ago.....no telling how much now? Hateful language. Hateful signs. Disruptive and illegal behavior that is actually dangerous when fire exits etc. are blocked. Who with any kind of common sense can condone that?
