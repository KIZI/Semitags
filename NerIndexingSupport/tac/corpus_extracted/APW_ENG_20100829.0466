Justin Bieber fans looking forward to his performance at the New York State Fair are going to have to wait a bit longer.

Fair officials said Bieber's concert planned for Sunday in Syracuse has been postponed until Wednesday because of illness.

Bieber performed Saturday night in Newark, New Jersey.
