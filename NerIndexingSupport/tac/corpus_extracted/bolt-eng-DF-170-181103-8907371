That was this morning....as were the firefighters.

People have been allowed in and out since then, but the number inside at any one time is being controlled.
 
 
BTW its illegal fro them to do it.

Alright, I'll start.

Are the protesters still permitted to be there?

Yes or no?
 
 
They should break out the tear gas. My $.02.

ETA: And no, I'm not against their Constitutional right to gather. I just would like to see a bunch of liberals running around with their eyes watering for pure entertainment value.

A Republican lawmaker from Illinois introduced legislation Thursday that would subject Wisconsin senators who crossed the border to Illinois income taxes for their time working in the Land of Lincoln.
Illinois Rep. Mike Tryon, of Crystal Lake, said the Wisconsin lawmakers should be subject to the Illinois tax in the same way Green Bay Packers players must pay Illinois tax for games played at Soldier Field
Tryon said he opposed a 2007 bill that extended the 5% Illinois tax to temporary workers  including professional athletes and movie stars. But if its on the books, the Wisconsin senators should pay, Tryon said.

"The state senators who are hiding out down in Illinois should show up for work, have their say, have their vote, add their amendments, but in the end, we've got a $3.6 billion budget deficit we've got to balance."
Senate rules and the state constitution say absent members can be compelled to appear, but it does not say how.
"We left the state so we were out of the reach of the Wisconsin state patrol, which has the authority to round us up and bring us back to the legislature," state Sen. Mark Miller told ABC's "Good Morning America" from an undisclosed location Friday.

A dysfunctional relationship. The people have been living in a state with a government that has delibrately created a dysfunctional relationship with it's own workers. That's why they voted in Walker to fix the problem.

They are public servants. They aren't entitled to the tax payers money. Especially when they refuse to get off their ass and work.

Who do they need to have permission from?

 

Most publicly owned land has curfews as to their hours of operation. State parks, national monuments, and the like.

They are most likely staying past operational hours. That the police haven't given them the boot says a lot of how much they are willing to placate the sit-in hippies.

Now the protesters, dont they have jobs to go to ? And ware are they taking a bath at ? If we go by all the other leftist gatherings and the mess they leave I would have to think that place is a mess.

Well they already have the green light from Rep. Michael Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat: "I'm proud to be here with people who understand that it's more than just sending an email to get you going. Every once and awhile you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody when necessary." However, unless the Tea-Party is attached to it, don't expect much media outrage and attention.

In keeping with the discussion, is there another "undisclosed" reason behind the real outrage of many of these Democrats?

 
'Get a Little Bloody'
A Democratic congressman urges government employees to take violent action.
 'Get a Little Bloody' - WSJ.com 
By JAMES TARANTO  WallStreet Journal

.... As Michael Barone notes, public-sector unions "are a mechanism by which every taxpayer is forced to fund the Democratic Party," Capuano's party:

Unions, most of whose members are public employees, gave Democrats some $400 million in the 2008 election cycle. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the biggest public employee union, gave Democrats $90 million in the 2010 cycle.
Follow the money, Washington reporters like to say. The money in this case comes from taxpayers, present and future, who are the source of every penny of dues paid to public employee unions, who in turn spend much of that money on politics, almost all of it for Democrats.

TDM you are such a horses ass. (thats a real insult to horses everywhere)

Walker was elected to get the State of WI out of its financial mess. He ran on that platform and was elected. He is doing is exactly what he said he was gonna do.

In case you haven't noticed its rather hard to discuss and debate anything when the Dems leave the State and refuse to discuss or debate anything. I guess they only represent the Union members, not the rest of the taxpayers of the State.

If the Reps had done that anywhere you would be the first one on the rooftop screaming about it.

Obamacare had many months of discussion thats for sure. The problem is the majority of the people didn't want it and the Dems weren't interested in listening to what the Reps had to say. Does the phrase WE WON. STFU and get to the back of the room ring any bells?? The Dems passed that mess of a bill and yes it was crammed down the taxpayers throats.

If the voters of WI don't like what the Gov is doing they will vote him out in 4 years. They will elect another Dem and the status quo will be in full swing once more. However, if the Gov does get the State back on good financial footing I would venture to say that he will be re-elected and probably in a landslide.
 
 
 
Allowing the people of wisconson the time to react to a bill BEING SHOVED DOWN THERE THROATS is a good thing dont you think?

 

So you have no problem with Obamacare getting shoved down peoples throats, but you have a problem with people expecting state politicians to actually debate and discuss a bill? Especially when the governor specifically campaigned and won clearly announcing what he intended to do.

 
Or are you only concerned with that action when you claim it your throat having something shoved down it?

 

Republicans didn't run away from the debate. We fought it. We wont the debate and the public opinion and you still forced it through.

 
The right cracks me up in their willingness to spin on a dime for political purposes.

 

It's not the right spinning here. Why don't you stop and deal with your own hypocrisy before you worry about the right.

Yes. Yes it was crammed down our throats. Yes we had many months of discussion. See the people yelled no and you still held them down and raped them with Obamacare.

You cant discuss the plan with people who run away from the jobs like cowards. They should be fired and recalled.
 
 
I guess it is better to starve them than to actually have to listen to what they have to say

If they want someone to listen to what they say they should get their representatives to actually show up at work and speak what they want them to say.

You know, actually have a discussion and debate.

But the Democrats of Wisconsin don't want that. If they did, their reps wouldnt have run away. They would be discussing and debating the provisions, not whining like a little baby.

Oh and no one is forcing them to be there. They can go home and eat. They can go to work.

The idea that they have no choice in this is absurd.
 
 
I still say he's going to gas them.

Probably tonight.

Watch and see.
 
 
 
 
Allowing the people of wisconson the time to react to a bill BEING SHOVED DOWN THERE THROATS is a good thing dont you think?

Or are you only concerned with that action when you claim it your throat having something shoved down it?

The right cracks me up in their willingness to spin on a dime for political purposes.

 

They need to pass the Budget, so they can see what's in it.

Don't you think?

 

They probably should. Can't imagine why they dont find that a persuasive reason to pass it.
 
 
As to the OP. The problem seems to be passing food in through the windows.

This isn't the 60's. Why don't they use the front door? Would that appear less rebellious?

Please don't suck the drama out of the idea that they are somehow bolted inside the building.
 
 
One of the major principles underlying is a system of checks and balances - nobody is in a position to wield absolute power.

Governor Walker and his Republican supporters in this forum all want to teach the state employees a "lesson" - the reality is that many of those workers will still be there long after the Governor has passed into history.

I've seen this happen before and it will take decades to undo the damage that's already been done!

Any human resources person will tell you that this "hardball" approach to managing people may get a few short term results, but over the long run it is totally counterproductive.

Nice bold font.

What do you think about the OP? You simply took this opportunity to rant.

Which is what liberals do, but I'm trying to help you to focus.

I guess "Go away and stop bothering me" is always a choice
 
 
 
 
Because it was NOT crammed down anyones throat.

It had MANY months of discussion.

How long did walker discuss this plan with the peoples reps in Wis?

 

Yes. Yes it was crammed down our throats. Yes we had many months of discussion. See the people yelled no and you still held them down and raped them with Obamacare.

You cant discuss the plan with people who run away from the jobs like cowards. They should be fired and recalled.

 

Remember the dog and pony show sit down Obama had with the republicans shortly before that BS bill was shoved down our collective throats?.........Obama wasn't there to listen. All he did was lecture.....A few weeks later, we were screwed over by the dem's.

Funny now that 26 states and climbing are pushing back against it. Obama is now making innuendos that he may just have to give all states the opt out option, and federal judges are deeming it unconsitutional........Basically, all that time and money wasted on the taxpayers backs was completely wasted. Seeing as though the bill is now, for all intensive purposes, dead in the water............IDIOTS!.
 
 
oh brother, you just gotta love the DRAMATIC title to this thread.

walker want to starve them out.

From some of the pictures I've seen of the smarmy protesters. A few days of starving might save their lard asses life.

where is MaBell Obama swooping in with her "save the fatty campaign) when you need her.

There were boxes of Pizza and whatnot being delivered outside the building, for Christ sakes.

TM is so full of shit, she's about ready to explode.
 
 
God forbid the Governor actually listens to non-consenting opinions

My way or the highway is all he needs to know
 
 
He hasn't gassed them yet????

Gotta give Walker props....he's a lot more patient and compassionate than I thought.

But he's gonna gas 'em.

Just a matter of time.

Did you actually type that with a straight face?

Sounds like Obama after he got elected. Didn't Walker and the Republicans in Wisconsin get a mandate from the voters too?

they have taken the highway,on their own, they left.

the assmeblymen aren't there to listen, unless of course telling a rep. in the assembly "you're dead" is constructive criticism.

no, the mandate to govern or 'I win' only goes one way you see.
 
 
 
Polls show walker would lose the election if it were held today

 

 

woulda coulda shoulda.... STFU pleeeeze!
 
 
 
I still say he's going to gas them.

Probably tonight.

Watch and see.

 

We all better run out and buy some popcorn.  
 
 
There was FINALLY some video of the crowd (might have been a soccer team, I'm not sure) as the speech drew nearer.....

The union is obviously tired.

Or perhaps Tuesday is 2 for 1 at Brunswick?
