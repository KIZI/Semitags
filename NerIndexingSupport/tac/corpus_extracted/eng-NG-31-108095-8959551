Did anyone happen to notice the most historic event to take place in college
football history!

Just curious?

Only thing I was curious about was how long it would take you to post
something ;-)

Maybe the most historic game in App State football history and certainly a
worthy victory even if Michigan didn't have the ranking they had, but I
wouldn't call another over-hyped over-ranked Big 10 team getting beat out of
conference again "the most historic event to take place in college football
history."

Congrats.  That would be like Nevada beating Nebraska.
Went down for the pre-game to the Nebraska game as my daughter is in
the marching band.  I didn't have a red shirt on and felt absolutely
naked.
Again, congrats.

Excitement can cause a person to make all kinds of fantastic claims, but it
doesn't appear that I am alone.

"We'll still be talking about it a few decades from now. Especially in the
locker rooms of every huge underdog, where they'll say, "If Appalachian
State can beat Michigan, why can't we shock the world, too?" "
http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&id;=3...

Take ESPNs "Rank'em: Biggest Upsets Ever?"
http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/rank?versionId=1&listId;=34

Rank the upsets on the list provided and then get the results. (clearly not
scientific)

HOWEVER!

ASU's upset of Michigan has received over 21.600 #1 votes.  About 20,000
more votes than any other upset since 1913.

"Upset for the ages: Appalachian State takes down No. 5 Michigan "

SI.COM  "An All-Time Shocker" http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/

"No. 5 Michigan stunned by I-AA App. State (biggest upset in college

FreeRepublic.com

The icing on the cake is that Michigan paid ASU $400,000.00 to kick their
butts!

Of course the game yesterday is not the REALLY BIG STORY!

In the process of carrying the goal post up to the chancellor's house, the
rable of students passed between Founder's Hall and the Admin. Building.
Rather than go around two $2000 Sternberg lamp post fixtures
http://tinyurl.com/28lxc3 , they went thru them.  Not only did they knock
the fixtures down, but they busted the concrete base in-half on one and
toppled the concrete base on the other, as well as taking the lamp head to
one of the fixtures ( both fixture were a total loss--or what was left of
them).  That head is about a 35 lb., 30 X 24 inch fixture.  I can't imagine
why anyone would wanted to carry it around campus, but it likely resides in
some students dorm room, presently.  I was called into work yesterday to
cap-off the exposed wiring that was left after the rampage.  I will have to
set new concrete bases on Tues. and replace the post lights after the
concrete cures.

All was not a waste though--I got 6 hours comp-time out of the deal!

predict the win over Michigan is worth at least $1.8 million

I was thinking Bo doesn't have to put-up with it anymore.
Hayes was a character, I'll never forget the time he punched an opposing
defensive-
back after an interception when he was running for a touchdown near the
sidelines.
Woody was 65 at the time and it cost him his Buckeye's coaching job. Hayes
never apologized either.

ASU"s (the real one) proudest moment was when they invented the Fiesta

They kept winning the WAC and went to (look it up) places like the
Peach Bowl or Sun Bowl.  So the guys that bought the Purdue

their own bowl game and invite others.
Nobody came
Then, when Oklahoma or Colorado won the Big8 one year and NE stayed
home, the ASU boosters invited NE to come down for a "friendly" bowl
game.
They responded: "piss off" -- or whatever Huskers mumble in that vein.
The boosters sent them an 18 wheeler full of frozen chickens.
