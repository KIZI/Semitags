A new truther group has emerged.

 http://www.911oz.com 

Australians for truth gather outside Sydney town hall on the 11th of every month and protest. They seem like nice guys, but don't appear to be very well informed about the facts.

We've got some guys and gals from Australia here don't we? Any from Sydney? Get down there  
 
 
Heheh, not very well-informed indeed. "Lorie Auken"? It's  Lorie Van Auken .
 
 
Sigh.... I suppose it had to happen. I wonder if they will admit the real reason for gathering at the Town Hall is to meet girls.

Interesting choice, given there is an Amercian consolate 3 blocks east of that location

Hmm sounds interesting. I might check it out.

See - we have morons, too.

Drat. I'm in Melbourne. I could probably make it down to Sydney at some point for a one-off debunking session. I might set my sights on September.

It's interesting they choose the 11th of each month. I understand the obvious reason, but out of the 12 months this year, the 11th is on a weekday 8 times. Don't these people have jobs?

Wait... that's probably a stupid question.
 
 
There is quite a high contingent of Aussies here...

I knew a guy once who thought he could impress a girl by showing her how much he knew about Star Trek. This sounds like the same kind of approach.

I wonder what they are trying to achieve, anyway? It's not like Sydney Town Hall holds much sway in international affairs.  
 
 
I just tries accessing their site.

OMG!!!1!! The CIA got to them already.

Aside from the Italian Pasta served at the canteen........... No lol
 
 
Will this infection of "truth" never end?
 
 
Just reading some of the comments on the 911oz site which, after my revealing the CIAs involvment, is now back up (duh-duh-duuuuhh!!).

Apparently they had a whole 4 people at their first "rally".

 
I'll bring the tin foil hats!

Nice turn out BTW. Four.
There'll be some car-door slamming in the streets Syndey now, for sure.

I can say from experience that there are far better and easier ways to meet girls in Sydney (that might actually work, too). Just stay out of Kings Cross.

Like many people here, I'm a Melbournite but I plan to be up in Sydney about mid-year. If the madness is still around then, anybody up for a debunking session?
 
 
Ill come for a trip to watch the crows boys smash sydney, but I dont think its till later in the year. I dont know if I can debunk as effectively as some but I am sure I dont know that unless I really try.

There are some tin foilers around the place in Adelaide. Most in the drugs community.

I reckon the skeptics would outnumber the troofers.

I'm a couple of hours south of Sydney, but go up there for the odd occasion.

I'll have a look at the website. Should be fun!

That's lucky. I'm a long way from Sydney and don't have any excuse to go there. Somehow I don't think trying to coax 4 nutters down from a delusional bandwagon would cut it with my family.

However, if there's ever plans for a Melbourne meet-up of JREFers, I'd definitely try to be there.

You said Sydney? That explains it.

I do see the odd, in both senses of the word, Larouchies around here too. They always seem to be pathetic.
 
 
I just watched their little video and I'm thinking I might show up there next month.
I'm no Gravy, but these guys don't look like much. I could be the Aussie Gravy, maybe I'll call myself Roux.

Well, if you want to name yourself after an Aussie foodstuff, how about..... *looks over shoulders*..... Pavlova.  

*qarnos runs and hides from the angry New Zealanders*
 
 
 
Hehehe. No, call yourself Jue... that'll mess with their tiny minds.

 
No, because a Jew would be jus what they're expecting.

ETA I was going to fix the typo in the above line, but decided to leave it as another saucey joke.

Sorry.
 
 
Hahaha!   It was better that way, Brainache.
But they wouldn't be expecting the Jewish Inquisition, would they? Or would they? I don't think I'll ever understand CTists.
 
 
I walked past the Larouchies at their little stall in the shopping centre, and thought "Will I just ask them even a few questions"? Stir them up a bit. They had even had some 9/11 posters up, along with the rest of the rubbish they publish. I really didn't feel like it. They are just so pathetic. They really are just sad little people. All they have to make them feel like they actually are important and of some significance on this planet is a totally wacky set of conspiracy theories. Didn't their mommies love them, did their daddies go out to drink at the pub every night?
 
 
Oooo! they got Mini-Nukers! Second only to No-planers and Beamers.

 
The image at left shows ejecta from an underground nuclear explosion. It is interesting to note the similarity between the visual appearance of the nuclear blast and the 'collapse' of the towers.

 
 
 
 
"Larouche"...that's not the group that believes that global warming was discovered by some guy 400 years ago is it?

I remember on campus a while ago there was a group calling themselves a "science" group promoting wacky ideas. Me and my friend were going to tape me confronting them over some of their claims, but they haven't been back.

And a Melbourne meet up would be something I'd be up for too.

I'm not sure there would be any point.

There are people who don't know all the detail, and only see the flashy vids or the assertions that seem to make sense. Once you explain to them the details, why this seems right but is wrong, why this person is qualified but not in the field they are talking about, etc, they wise up. Besides, they tend not to go to these 'truther'-type functions.

The other group are the hard-core true believers. If it's anti-American, they'll believe it. If it's anti-government, they believe it. If it's anti-establishment, they believe it. No need for facts; they just like to hang out with like-minded folk and discuss what they would change if they ran things. They won't be open to an alternative viewpoint; if it disagrees with them, it's propaganda - and the person saying it must be a disinfo agent. They're not open to change, so don't bother trying.

I was thinking of just shadowing them as they try to pass on their stuff to the passers by and putting the other side of the argument. I know you can't convert the true believers, but you can try to make sure their lies aren't spread uncontested.
 
 
Point taken. Agreed.

Isn't that 56.94lbs?
 
 
Quiet you oppressive pommie.  
 
 
I'm thinking of hopping on a train to Town Hall tomorrow to see if these guys are still doing their stuff. Anyone else from Sydney interested?
 
 
I'm sorting my sock-drawer, man. It's been days since the last time...

Yah, I'm a Sydneysider. I'd love to join up with you, Brain. Not this month though, as I am in the middle of a big project, and working late most nights. Next month I can toddle along and we can roast them together.

Oh, Sydney ??? Bugger that - I don't wanna go there.

Syndey is a much better place.
 
 
Apology that I cannot attend. Expression of desire to one day live in Sydney. Wisecrack, followed by a touchingly ironic statement.

Words of encouragement. A salutation, followed by my username.

These are things that I would write, if I were replying to you.
 
 
Brainache, you still planning on going today/tonight? I can't meet up with you today, but can make it next month (depending on work).

I thought they protested at 11AM. 911oz doesn't seem too specific about the time though.

I didn't get there either. Had some parenting to do. Maybe next month. It will be on the Queen's birthday holiday monday and also, according to my calender, Jacques Cousteau's birthday. Can't think of a better way to celebrate!

Just found this thread and checked out 911oz.com. Theyve now spread to Brisbane. Gah!

Apparently they set themselves up beside Anzac Square on 11 September. Had a look at their forum  its the usual nonsense. If this wasnt out of date I would have nominated it for a Stundie. The person who wrote it purports to be an architect  

 
I've always thought the collapse of towers 1 and 2 were a little strange. I remember thinking on the actual day that if they were to collapse they would break at the impact points and the tops would fall to one side and maybe take a chunk of a few more floors with them but still leave the rest of the tower below the impact point still standing.

Every time I look in here lately I am reminded that I have not posted for a while, so to get rid of that reminder, I will post here.

I look in on the 911oz Board pretty much every day. 911oz is a sad little group, which appears to be shrinking in numbers (from a very small base anyway) and shrinking in interest from the few members it has.

Several threads (seriously, I cannot even be bothered providing links, so I will accept that you may not believe what I say) started off with let's do this on this date, and the responses are generally "sounds great, do it, I am otherwise busy and cannot make it, good luck"

Most of the more recent thread starters have virtually no text, but are simply links to youtube, blogs, BBs or other news items which vaguely fit into the overarching "they are trying to get us" conspiracy nutter articles. And the responses are, Wow! Fantastic! This is the Big One!

Sadly, one of the Mods is from my home town (Geelong - AFL premiers in 2007 BTW. I knew I had a reason for posting this),whose major activity according to him is burning and distributiing DVDs proving the 9/11 conspiracy. (Sadly, I have not seen one.

But overall these people are just losers mentally living in the Aussie equivalent of a basement. And being on their forum is like walking through a large, empty high-ceiling hall, hearing the echo of your own footsteps.

Are they still meeting at Sydney Town Hall on the 11th of each month? I get up there several times a month and just might check them out. Yes and good on Geelong. I happen to be someone who follows AFL and the NRL. Yes, the mighty Melbourne Storm!
 
 
OMG I have just gone to their site and they set up a stall in Melbourne on 9/11. In Dandenong, which they described as a beautiful, verdant suburb. Truth takes another beating (something well understood by Melburnians.....)

I've lived close to Dandenong (Skye). Mmm... 'beautiful and verdant'... not quite the words that immediately spring to my mind. Why Dandenong, though? Is that where they hang out, or could it be that their strategy is to target people with lower intellect, who are easily taken in? That would explain Dandenong!

Thought it was gonna be the Cats and the Pies. I reckon we'd have put up a better fight!

Skye is certainly not Dandenong, and in case you detect snobbery, I lived in Redfern for the early part of my life. But back to your point, this is exactly the place where I would target the gullible.
 
 
They probably chose Dandenong because neither of them could afford the bus/tram/train fare to go any further.

And yes, lionking STORM RULES!!! Melbourne Victory will complete the trifecta.

Norm
 
 
Dandenong is a fair train/bus fare already, unless they all live there...though since zone 3 was abolished it might be cheaper, I don't know.

One of the guys in the opera is LIHOP and Apollo Hoaxer. I want to punch something, and I want to punch it hard.
 
 
I'm on the Aussie Truther mailing list because I joined their forum for a laugh. I got this email today:

 
Our commitment is constant and unwavering... we will continue to speak the truth about 9/11 until the wall of ignorance, denial and deceit has been utterly and permanently demolished.

Please stay with us on this journey, and thanks for your support!

The NZ troof fight is a lost cause. To many sheeple  
 
 
I had a bit more of a look at the forum after my post last night. Judging by the Admin comments about racial vilification and banning certain topics (eg Holocaust revision) theyve attracted some unsavoury types. What is it with bigots who see Zionist conspiracies everywhere?

They did have a link to an  opinion piece  in The Age from 10 September that I hadnt seen before. Its by Christopher Scanlon from RMIT. They published his email address on the forum, so the poor bloke was probably inundated with troofer madness.

Watch out everybody! Sydney is on the march tomorrow (11/10?)

 http://www.911oz.com/forum/public/viewtopic.php?t=787 

The clarion call was made to make sure to be at the Sydney Town Hall, the one entire response "be there if I can", and later "sorry I can't make the banners and can't make the protest".

So, if anybody from Sydney will be passing the Town Hall tomorrow at 11:00, you might see a forlorn character with no banners (maybe a card table and some handouts) wondering "where have all the flowers gone......

As I said earlier on this thread, what a sad little bunch. They have missed a boat that has already pretty much sunk elsewhere anyway.

Norm
 
 
I find myself in the unusual position of being employed at the moment so I can't attend their pathetic card table revolution. I'll keep an eye out for any black T-shirts around here (a university) though and make sure I snort derisively.
 
 
I wonder what they're hoping to achieve. Calling for a new 9/11 investigation is a total non-issue here. It would be interesting to see what other activist groups they're involved in. (Not that I'm interested enough to join their forum and ask them.)
 
 
I will actually be at Town Hall tomorrow at around 11am, because I need to be in the city for coffee and other important things. I might swing by, but honestly I don't know if I'd be able to control myself meeting these people in person...I don't want to get arrested or get sent a bill for a broken video camera.

I'll play it by ear and see how my temper is tomorrow...

I can tell you there's none at Latrobe, at least not in any organised form. The closest thing is the socialist alliance, who blame everything (almost, anyway) on US imperialism, but they don't deny 9/11, at least not to my knowledge
 
 
Hi Guys, it may interest you to know that the group "Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth" now has 192 members.

Overall the 9/11 Truth Movement continues to grow despite being ignored and derided by the media.

Meanwhile our government continues to support a war in Iraq which was based on lies, and which has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. This heinous war was made possible by the atrocities of 9/11, which were predicted by the neo-conservative think tank "Project For a New American Century" as a necessary "catastrophic and catalysing event" which would allow them to fulfill their goal of global hegemony.

Now they are poised to attack Iran. Which side are you guys on?
 
 
Dumb question, but do you have any evidence that a military action against Iran is imminent?

well right now im in architectural college with 200+ people that think that a plane hitting your building at 500 mph will knock it down. and if the project for a new american century were so sinister, why would they make there stuff avalable on the web?
but then again im probably being indoctrinated by NWO institutions to not see the "truth", so...
 
 
911ounce: So at this rate, in 1500 years, your AE4TROOF4EVA will match the ASCE membership in 2007? And guess what the ASCE says about your idiotic theories: They're BUNK!

Also, how many of those 192 are actually civil or structural engineers? No where near 192.
 
 
 
Dumb question, but do you have any evidence that a military action against Iran is imminent?

 
Troofers are going with the "Broken Watch" theory on everything.

Since January 1st, they've been saying "LOOK! THE NWO WILL INVADE IRAN IN 2 WEEKS!" and they just keep revising the date, based on U.S. holidays, Muslim holy days, International dates that mean something, Phases of the moon, etc.

Personally I think there's a 30% chance of airstrikes in Iran before the next Presidential election... But an invasion? I put that at 0.005%

Hi Guys, it may interest you to know that the group "Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth" now has 192 members.

 
There are 10,000 - 50,000 scientologists in the world. Does that make them right?

 
Overall the 9/11 Truth Movement continues to grow despite being ignored and derided by the media.

 
Furthermore, the 9/11 Truth Movement has successfully accomplished absolutely nothing other than convincing more people that their lies are true.

 
Meanwhile our government continues to support a war in Iraq which was based on lies, and which has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians.

 
Categorically false. The number isn't in the hundreds of thousands at this stage. The best estimate is iraqbodycount.net, an anti-war organization that puts the figure around 90,000 based on factual information.

 
 http://www.iraqbodycount.org/about/  IBCs figures are not estimates but a record of actual, documented deaths. IBC records solely violent deaths. IBC records solely civilian (strictly, non-combatant) deaths. IBCs figures are constantly updated and revised as new data comes in, and frequent consultation is advised.

 
I know with your "hundreds of thousands" figure, that you are referring to either the Lancet study or the most recent "1.2 Million deaths" study. Both of which are essentially as useful as feces.

The methods used in these studies are far less than convincing, and if true, would lead to the conclusion that nearly 800 Iraqis have been killed every day in Iraq with neither the Independent or Mainstream media picking up on it. Do you actually believe that?

The methods used to reach such high numbers were knocking on approximately 1,000 doors of one area of the country, asking how many have died from combat since the beginning of the war in that house, assuming the information you are getting is correct, applying the average deaths per house hold to the entire nation. I'm guessing you can figure out where the errors could be made in using this method.

Here are some criticisms of these studies:

This heinous war was made possible by the atrocities of 9/11, which were predicted by the neo-conservative think tank "Project For a New American Century" as a necessary "catastrophic and catalysing event" which would allow them to fulfill their goal of global hegemony.

 
You have not read the PNAC document. Please read it.

 
Now they are poised to attack Iran. Which side are you guys on?

 
Not yours.
 
 
On a lighter note - Pity about the Aus rugby side. Loosing to the English... AGAIN!!
New Zealand was a shocker though! Ref was oblivious to the game of rugby that he "officiated".

Well at least my side looks pretty set for the Final. Sad, though was looking forward to a SA vs NZ final.

Others have handled the rest, but get real. What troops will the US use? The ones that have had their stays extended in Iraq? How will they get support from the people of the US considering how unpopular the Iraq War is right now?

Although a valid point, my personal opinion is that any war with Iran would simply involve a massive air raid on Iran involving the Israeli and US armed forces. Ground troops and an extended campaign wouldn't be a plausible option at the moment.

Any retaliatory strike by the Iranians would be relatively small, assuming the air raids are successful at destroying Iranian military assets. It would, however, be directed at Israel and the men and women of the US armed forces in Iraq, which is something we don't want. If Iraq and Afghanistan have shown us anything, however, it's that the US military is frighteningly skilled and efficient at conventional warfare (the rapid overthrow of Iraq and Afghanistan showed us this). This is what we'd see in an Iranian conflict. It's the counter-insurgency stuff that needs practice.

Personally I think the "efforts" of the touch judges were even more appalling, given that they were both very experienced. There's also word out that prior to the game the touch judges were explicitly told to ignore forward passes, which makes you wonder why we lost out on a try due to a forward pass and France didn't. But regardless of that, the French played with a lot of spirit and deserved to win. I didn't see the Australia/England game but had heard the efforts by the referees in that game were pretty poor as well.

Why would they be told to ignore the rules? What next? Ignoring LBWs in cricket?

I heard a report on Radio 4 on Tuesday by a New Zealand sports correspondant, talking about the hordes of shell-shocked Australians and New Zealanders who are currently wandering around Paris with prepaid hotel reservations, tickets for a match they don't have any interest in seeing, and the look of people trying to pretend they're actually somewhere else. It was really very funny.

It's the ANZAC tradition - being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

(no offence intended of course)

Well the explanation I heard was that it was intended to keep the flow of game play uninterrupted. Sounds reasonable at first glance, except it doesn't really work if you only ignore forward passes from one team...  

If they don't want to interrupt gameplay why don't they just scrap the rules and make it a free for all?

We prefer to think of it as being at the wrong place at the right time.   How would those Europeans ever liberate their continent without us Colonists?

I didn't see the Australia/England game but had heard the efforts by the referees in that game were pretty poor as well.

 
The Australians were losing the scrum very badly, and it took until the second half for the referee to figure it out. Once he did Australia didn't get any more points.

However, nobody understands the scrum except a handful of hookers and props. There are international rugby players working as expert commentators who say they don't know what's going on.

 
2011 perhaps?  

 
There has to be a good conspiracy theory to explain NZ in the World Cup.
 
 
 
If they don't want to interrupt gameplay why don't they just scrap the rules and make it a free for all?  

 
Because then it would be Australian Rules Football.

Welcome to the forum, BTW.

 
I registered a while ago after gtc posted a link from 911oz that was said to be mine but wasn't. I was going to say something but decided I had a life and quickly forgot about it all.
I wrote this time not for the purpose of sharing my not caring, rather to ask a question, which very few have actually managed to answer.

BTW, thanks for the welcome, that is very polite of you and it is warmly received.

GTC it is your fault I am here so if you want to pick on me about my lacking capacity to correctly place apostrophe's','' it is a sign of three things on your part;
1) you are uptight and judgmental
2) you correct others because it gives you a sense of power, which is egotistical
3) you correct others to avoid dealing with the issue at hand, which you have done in this case.
I am glad the videos amuse you, they amuse me too.
Why start on another topic, 911?? (ohh so sorry about the misuse of question marks) Is that another avoidance method?
I am not here to discuss anything about 911. Do you honestly think I would set myself up to be your target practice?? (ohh there I go again) Lets face it, no matter what I said you would attack me about my use of apostrophe's',' and attempt a debunking session which will be pointless and a waste of our time. So lets just leave it on this note shall we.

So basically you went on about your judgmental judgments of gtc for a few paragraphs and didn't really say anything about 9/11. Because you didn't want to be target practice.

That's a good sentiment.

I'd call it a woman with an over inflated sense of her own intelligence repeating the same old lies from all the usual CT nutjobs. She does it all without a script (big mistake IMO) and it appears to have been edited at random by someone who has no idea what they are doing. The camera work is apalling.

She spends a lot of time saying "ummm" and "errr", repeats herself a lot and generally appears to be a scatterbrain.

She is however quite nice looking. Shame about the content though...

None of this makes any sense. I just don't like the way you misuse apostrophes.

I am very happy to discuss the issue at hand, but I have no idea which issue you wish to discuss. Perhaps you could start by telling us which piece of evidence most convinced you that 911 was an inside job.
