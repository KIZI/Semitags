The agent for Japanese pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma has said the Oakland Athletics were "insincere" after his client was unable to reach an agreement with the Major League team.

"Their offer was low and they weren't sincere," Don Nomura said Wednesday, a day after the Athletics announced they were unable to reach an agreement to sign the Japanese pitcher during the exclusive 30-day negotiating period.

Oakland won the negotiating rights to the 29-year-old Iwakuma in early November under the bidding treaty between Major League Baseball and the Japanese commissioner's office.
