 
 
The Question You Should Ask Why Moslems Hate U.S.A?!!
 
 
-------------------------

The first question Americans should ask about their enemies (any enemy)is why they are their enemy in the first place?!!

The second question Americans should ask about Moslems is why they hate Americans?!!

Dears:
We dont hate Christians, we love jesus because Moslem can't be accepted as a Moslem unless he believes in all prophets,.... but we hate the American government, and because of the support of the Americans to their government, we hate them too. We hate you because you are over here and because you are meddling in our affairs.

You are meddling aginst Palestinians, afghans, and Iraqis, and supporting all corruptive and dectator governments in the Moslems countries.

We are not stupid to believe the American propaganda that more than 2000 Americans killed and more than 20,000 injured is just to spread the democracy in Iraq..

Some of Americans says:
September 11th was the result of the terrorists hating freedom and democracy, or because theyre poor.... and I'd say just to remind you:
The hijackers came from wealthy families.
half of them are millionaires, and even Osama bin Laden is himself a multimillionaire (it does not mean i support him), but just to remind you.

Dears:
Why don't we have the right to say that Americans hate Moslems?
you might ask why, and i'd say; you hate us because:
you're supporting Israel looking with only one eye;
youre bombing Moslems in Iraq and Afghanistan;
you're standing with the corruptive governments in our Moslems' countries.

After that, do you have the right to ask:
why do Moslems hate America?!

Note:
American government spends too much money these days to beautify its picture in the Moslem world, and according to Aljazeera channel poll as of Oct,25,2005,.....more than 83% of the pollers said: America can't beautify its ugly face in the Moslems' countries as long as America is controlled by goernments as the government of Push;
17% said yes..............

Finally; there is a chance to think and correct the mistakes, we want to live peacefully without hating any one in the whole world.... all of us are from our father Adam and our mother Eve..
and all of us have one Lord ALLAH.......

Thank You All

Dear Confident,

We too have our axes to grind. We hate the Islamofascists, which you seem to have empathy with.

Why? They wish to destroy civilization as we know it.

Peace unto you, but screw submission.

I know, not PC, but it's Friday.
 
 
Confident, I'd like you to answer these question, since you know so much about it!!
You seem to have the U.S down! So, what's their reason's for hating Spain, France, England, Isreal? Why do they hate their own women? Why do they believe in beheadings, in stoning their women to death? Sheeesh
 
 
Don't sweat it, Confident. There are white conservatives in America who object to Jewish meddling with American foreign policy as much as Muslim murder of our Western people. If I have my way, ALL OF YOU will get the boot! You'll be confined to the stinking deserts of the Levant, where the best Semite will win. Just leave us ALONE. And did I mention? Screw Allah. He's a greasy Arab compared to the One True God, who has just informed me that He wants nothing to do with the destruction of the West, which He rather fancies --- when it wills life. 'Tis then He will carry us to victory in battle.

See below; Charles Martel has done it before. It will be done again.

Disabled Woman Set Ablaze
Updated: 12:36, Friday November 04, 2005

A handicapped woman was doused with petrol and set on fire by youths during another night of rioting in Paris.

The 56-year-old suffered third degree burns to 20% of her body in the attack.

Witnesses said a youth poured petrol over the woman and then threw a Molotov cocktail on to the bus she was travelling on in the suburb of Sevran.

Other passengers were able to flee but she was unable to escape because of her disabilities.

It was the worst incident so far in more than a week of rioting.

For the first time, there were also signs of copycat rampages elsewhere in France.

Police said several cars in the eastern city of Dijon were set alight, while similar attacks took place in the western Seine-Maritime region and the Bouches-du-Rhone in the south of the country.

More than 160 cars were reportedly torched in the Paris region, as well as 33 in the provinces.

But police said the night seemed calmer than the one before, when 315 vehicles were burnt in the Ile-de-France region around the capital.

Buses, fire engines and police were again stoned in the Paris suburbs, with five policemen reported slightly injured.

However, there were fewer direct confrontations between police and "troublemakers".

One of the worst incidents took place at Neuilly-sur-Marne where police vans came under fire from pellet pistols, but nobody was hurt.

Neuilly-sur-Marne is in the worst-hit northeastern region of Seine-Saint-Denis, where 1,300 officers were deployed, and more than 30 people were arrested there and elsewhere.

The rioting is a direct challenge to the authority of the French government and to Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in particular.

On Thursday he told parliament authorities "will not give in" to the violence and will make restoring order their "absolute top priority".

 
 
 
 
Confident, I'd like you to answer these question, since you know so much about it!!
You seem to have the U.S down! So, what's their reason's for hating Spain, France, England, Isreal? Why do they hate their own women? Why do they believe in beheadings, in stoning their women to death? Sheeesh

 

dear:
ask first: why don't they hate Canada, Japan, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark......? they consider Isreal in Palestine as the white man in the new land of Red Indians,, however they want 2 live tgetger peacefully, but Sharoon doesn't accept with the knowledge of usa.

2nd u r mistaken, what u wrote about their women is wrong...

try to be Equitable...

the healthy mind seeks 4 peace and love...

thank u any way.

Does the stream of Lies ever end?
 
 
Confident, what makes you so confident?

And have you stopped beating your wife?
 
 
 
-------------------------

The first question Americans should ask about their enemies (any enemy)is why they are their enemy in the first place?!!

 

Because they intentionally set out to kill 3,000+ innocent civilians.

 
The second question Americans should ask about Moslems is why they hate Americans?!!

 

The question I asked on 9-11 was who was it, and how do we kill the rest of them?

 
Dears:
We dont hate Christians, we love jesus because Moslem can't be accepted as a Moslem unless he believes in all prophets,.... but we hate the American government, and because of the support of the Americans to their government, we hate them too. We hate you because you are over here and because you are meddling in our affairs.

 

Any Muslim who claims ownership of 'affairs' in their home country is either a liar or a dictator's propagandist.

 
You are meddling aginst Palestinians,

 

By not killing Jews?

 
afghans,

 

By not holding free elections?

 
and Iraqis,

 

By not holding free elections?

 
and supporting all corruptive and dectator governments in the Moslems countries.

 

By not invading and then holding free elections?

 
We are not stupid to believe the American propaganda that more than 2000 Americans killed and more than 20,000 injured is just to spread the democracy in Iraq..

 

So no free elections happened?  

 
Some of Americans says:
September 11th was the result of the terrorists hating freedom and democracy, or because theyre poor.... and I'd say just to remind you:
The hijackers came from wealthy families.
half of them are millionaires, and even Osama bin Laden is himself a multimillionaire (it does not mean i support him), but just to remind you.

 

WTF does this have to do with anything?

 
Dears:
Why don't we have the right to say that Americans hate Moslems?
you might ask why, and i'd say; you hate us because:
you're supporting Israel

 

This is tired.

 
with looking with only one eye;
youre bombing Moslems in Iraq and Afghanistan;
you're standing with the corruptive governments in our Moslems' countries.

 

Snooore!

 
After that, do you have the right to ask:
why do Moslems hate America?!

 

You don't speak for all Muslims, obviously.

 
Note:
American government spends too much money these days to beautify its picture in the Moslem world, and according to Aljazeera channel poll as of Oct,25,2005,.....more than 83% of the pollers said: America can't beautify its ugly face in the Moslems' countries as long as America is controlled by goernments as the government of Push;
17% said yes..............

 

Because we've given up on the Muslim world.  

 
Finally; there is a chance to think and correct the mistakes, we want to live peacefully without hating any one in the whole world.... all of us are from our father Adam and our mother Eve..
and all of us have one Lord ALLAH.......

Thank You All

 

So what does the 'Muslim world' want? To kill all the Jews in Israel, of course. Well after that, will you leave the Western world alone, or will you keep torching cars in Paris until we put you all up in a Westin Suite?

Arabs hate us because we have soap, deodorant, pants and all-you-can-eat buffets. They are jealous of the success of Israel's civilization and they all hate Barbara Streisand--so much in fact, that they are willing to blow themselves up like lemmings. Maybe they would act less like savages if we sent a Wal-Mart over there so that they could buy some soap.
:ali:
 
 
The question I asked on 9-11 is:

(although i'm against the hijackers), there is an important question....why did they do it??

why didn't they do it in Canada, Finland or Japan for example?

please:

leave ur hate and discuss logically...

Sir
u did not read the article..
The hijackers came from wealthy families.
half of them are millionaires, and even Osama bin Laden is himself a multimillionaire (it does not mean i support him), but just to remind you.

try to see how many poors in usa istead of wasting ur money in Iraq,
I know America very well, I was living in Miami Florida...

see this link and b cool:

and the cost of war:

 http://costofwar.com/index.html 

f u want 2 b my gust, u r welcome 2 see how generous, nice, and rich we r, let's live 2gether peacefully and ALLAH the Almighty will judge WHEN we go back 2 HIM....

We need a serious discussion not like written here by u my friends!!
 
 
 
The question I asked on 9-11 is:

(although i'm against the hijackers) yhere is an important question....why did the do it??

why didn;t they do it in Finland or Japan?

please:

leave ur hate and discuss logically...

 

It's crystal clear. The USA is a leader of the West and its Liberal principles of Democracy, Freedom, and Enlightened prosperity. If you are a post-Christ fundamentalist religion based on a Lunar God with strict superstitious beliefs, who would you naturally oppose in the 21st Century? America, of course. Because THEY are the ones who are afraid, in this changing world of ours.

Discuss logically? This coming from someone who posted that they only want peaceful coexistence with Israel?  

I suppose I should point out that Jews originally were Arabs until they were unlawfully dispossessed of their land and scattered about the planet? Which, would give them every bit as much right to Arab land as anyone else.

Or should I point out that true Palestinians were Southern Mediterranean in origin and disappeared off the map centuries ago? Your "Palestinians" who are in reality nothing more than Transjordan Arabs have a stated goal of wiping Israel out of existence. I don't see how that reconciles with your "peaceful coexistence" theory.

And I'll answer your question with a question..... Why Iraq and Afghanistan but not Saudi Arabia? A simple concept you closed-minded Arabs cannot grasp is that as long as you aren't threatening the US every other day, and murdering innocent noncombatants in some dishonest claim of "holy war," the US is pretty much indifferent to you and your prattling.

And buddy, if your "one, true God" advocates THAT, he sure as Hell isn't MY God.

But try thinking beyond the smokescreen you've put here. I don't hate Arabs, nor Muslims, and I would venture to guess most Americans don't. What we hate are murdering, lowlife religious zealots waging war against noncombatants because for all their rhetoric, they just don't have the stones to come out and fight like men.

And what I have against YOU and your kind personally is that if these religious fanatics TRULY amount to less than 10% of Muslims worldwide, why the Hell aren't y'all policing your own instead of leaving to us?

If you and those like you claim to be would spend less time ranting against the US and more time ranting against those who have perverted your religion, you COULD make a difference.
 
 
 
?

why didn't they do it in Canada, Finland or Japan for example?

please:

leave ur hate and discuss logically...

 

They tried. One who knows (like you "claim" too) would know attempts in the above nations (with the exception of Japan) have been thwarted. Right?

we want to live peacefully without hating any one in the whole world.... all of us are from our father Adam and our mother Eve..

then live peacefully and without hate and stop blowing up shit and killing people in england, france, germany, russia, iraq, afganistan, iran, syria, israel, bali, thailand, and pretty much everywhere else.....

also, those that you want to live in peace with.....belive people have the right to belive in whatever god they like you on the other hand don't belive peole should have that right......you belive that we should worship allah or die.....the civilized world is not going to be forced to worship your god....and that is why you want to kill everyone that does not agree with you....particularly the nations that will actually do something to stop you.....you wan't them dead the most so you try harder

BWAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA

They do consider Canada Japan (who has troops in Iraq by the way) etc the enemy.

Give me ONE GOOD SOLID IRREFUTABLE REASON why its ok to send a suicide/homicide bomber into the world trade center, killing CIVILIAN children, women and men. Otherwise everything you say is meaningless.

My neighbor steals my car, doesnt mean I go and murder his teenage daughter.

Muslims are blinded by satanic rage. When YOU make claims like we want peace in the name of God, YOU are committing the one unforgivable sin, blashpemy and YOU WILL ROT IN HELL. And I will be first in line to light the fire. YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT AS SURE AS THE SUN RISES TOMORROW.

Yes, but fortunately, you and your type is in a very, insignificant minority and always will be. You spread the same hatred as the Islamists, just for different reasons and in different ways.
 
 
 
The peace process is always ended when some new round of cafe bombings occurs.

Does the stream of Lies ever end?

 

Of course it wont RWA,,Satan is the father of lies. The first sin ever was a lie. He perpetuates it upon the enemies of Gods chosen people, the Jews, and now the Jews and Christians.

This is not radical ideology. Its very sound Biblical reading. When the Jews split up, God told them his cousins, the arabs would always be their adversary.

You have to wonder why the arabs hate the Jews so much. Its irrational. I am dead serious when I say Islam is satanic, and the arabs are his pawns.
Islam is a culture of death. Lies, Barbarianism. Mohammad was a lieing, materialistic power hungry Illiterate war mongering idiot who married an older woman for money and power. He lied when he wrote that piece of shit known as the Koran, it takes the Bible and "convienentaly" changes just the passages they need to, in order for it to allow them to believe what they want.
 
 
 
The question I asked on 9-11 is:

(although i'm against the hijackers), there is an important question....why did they do it??

why didn't they do it in Canada, Finland or Japan for example?

please:

leave ur hate and discuss logically...

 

If you were serious about a logical discussion, the REASON is because Canada, Finland and Japan are not going to provide Iraq with an opportunity for FREE elections, which is what they oppose.

OBL wants to control, CONTROL Saudi Arabia. He has neither the power or the might to do so, so he strikes at an ally of Saudi Arabia, the US in hopes that we will retreat from Saudi Arabia giving him the opportunity to take over SA, which he cant do as long as the US supports SA.

Now, I will tell you this, THIS DISCUSSION WILL END, AFTER ONE WARNING ABOUT BRINGING IN OBVIOUS PROPAGANDA BULLSHIT.

A logical discussion would require that we use normative accepted means of proving things. Some such as this, is not acceptable "What you see are just American lies, the real truth lies in Al Jazeer, the videos they made them up in Hollywood."

American press and European press are FREE, Arab press for the most part isnt. So, any serious and logical discussion will have to accept Western videotapes and western journalists first hand accounts.
 
 
 
Yes, but fortunately, you and your type is in a very, insignificant minority and always will be. You spread the same hatred as the Islamists, just for different reasons and in different ways.

 

I don't know, Luv. The West is burning, literally. Do you think my man Jean Marie Le Pen is becoming more popular in France right now, or less? Do you think he's looking less "fringe" these days?

Nationalistic movements are an "insignificant minority" when everything's happy and safe. When all hell starts to break loose, you'd be surprised what comes to the fore.

I think if you didn't have a little "hatred" in your heart for the killers of your people, that wouldn't be a sign of psychological health --- it would be a sign that you didn't care. And why is it always called "hatred" of other, instead of LOVE of your own people? It seems this formulation goes for groups that are unpopular, like white gentiles and sometimes Arabs (though I don't support them). Nobody ever says the Jews are "hate-filled" because they want Israel. But Jews are capable of hate, and as it stands, they're one of the few groups who get to unaplogetically act on their hatred. On our dime. And when they're not doing that, they're chasing down anyone of any other group to bash them as "haters" for doing the same fucking thing!

Y'know, it is well-documented that William Joyce and I don't exactly see eye to eye, and you are most certainly technically correct.

But I see a BIG difference in the level of hate. Right, wrong or indifferent, WJ is expressing his ideological viewpoint on a message board; which, is his right.

I doubt seriously he's out flying planes into buildings, cutting off people's heads, and/or driving truck bombs into marketplaces.

He also is on our side, agree with his ideology or not. The ideology of the other side includes our complete destruction.

Exactly Gunny! WJ has a right to his opinions, no matter how misguided I may think they are. He is not infringing on anyone's rights, no matter their color. He just wishes they would leave, which even he knows is NOT going to happen.

I honestly have no problem with separationists/isolationists if that's what they want to do as long as they aren't stepping all over someone else's dreams to achieve their own.

All too often in our Nation nowadays only the politically correct are allowed a voice, and I don't recall seeing that addendum to the First Amendment.

Your posts are undeserving of intelligent polite response since they are unintelligent and based on events that only take place in the minds of nutjobs such as yourself.

Dear Confident,

Piss off.

P.S. Watch yourself. If you actually believe all this crap, you may very well try to act on it, become an enemy of this nation and ending up on the wrong end of a 5.56x45mm NATO round. The Japanese, Germans, Italians, British, Spanish, French, and even our own people have found out what it's like to face the wrath of a pissed off America. The Muslims are next in line.

Confident,

This isn't a chat room (it's a message board there is a difference), there is no reason to use shorthand internet English other than pure laziness and an urge to look less than educated. Bragging about languages doesn't make one educated.

I think a better question to ask is why do muslims think there is nothing wrong with other members of their faith chopping off the head of civilians? Why are they not outraged at these terrorists bombing fellow muslims?

What kind of moral authority can a religion have for a person if those who follow it cant stand up against injustice and evil perpetuated by those who claim the faith as their own?

Good question. Someone may have to actually go out in real life and ask around at their local mosque.

I have to agree with Kathianne...screw 'em all. What did we as a society do with our "terrorist," Timothy McVeigh? We made short work of him -- we policed our own. Any nutcase in this Nation that commits murder in the name of anything is tracked down, tried, and put away or executed.

I have a hard time agreeing with Muslims who don't want to be identified with what they describe as a radical minority of their religion, when they just sit on the sidelines and watch.

Well next time in the area, I'll ask one. Austin has a bunch of evrything living here. I imagine it may be a bit scarey to condemn those of your own race and religion if you were a minority in America. You might get called an Uncle Allah or something.
Now in Yemen, they have no problem telling the Z terrorist that he is no longer welcome. Big street protests and everything.
 
 
 
Dear Confident,

We too have our axes to grind. We hate the Islamofascists, which you seem to have empathy with.

Why? They wish to destroy civilization as we know it.

Peace unto you, but screw submission.

I know, not PC, but it's Friday.

 

Double ditto to that Kathianne   Screw PC and it's only Tuesday!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Last stats I saw, the extremist whackos comprised about 10% of Islam. That means roughly 90% are sitting on their hands.

In Iraq, you have terrorists committing crimes then running to safety across the Syrian and/or Iranian borders where the actual governments if not giving tactic approval of their actions, at least turn a blind eye.

While I can applaud those who actually speak out, they really are a drop in the bucket when compared to the number that SHOULD BE speaking out.

The number of Americans who actually hope for a US defeat in Iraq astounds me more than that yet we tolerate em.

You hunting em down ? Outta be easy enough to get your limit. They can put out a crowd bigger than any pro-troop rally I have ever seen and the media will make it look even bigger. After we take care of our own traitors maybe we can feel better about challenging a muslim to take sides.

I don't see it as a separate issue. I think anyone who is so stupid as to want the US to lose a war, and all that such a loss would entail, needs to get the Hell out. At least be honest and walk the walk they talk and go live with the people whose side they're on rather than avail themselves of all our freedoms while at the same time wishing for their demise. I have just about as much tolerance for them as I do apathetic Muslims.

That would entail taking a risk----something you rarely see these days. I've learned to be surprised by risk takers instead of expecting them.

I condemn the behavior of all terrorists and extremists:
The behavior of Bush, Sharoon, Zarkawi, Osama, Solag,....
Now:
Do I have the right to hate those who don't condemn the behavior of these extremists and terrorists?!!!

Try to be just my Friend...

Why? You equate terrorist with men like President Bush and the Israeli Prime minister who are using all their power to FIGHT terrorism. A free government by definition cannot conduct terrorism. A government controled by the people has no power to terrorize. if they even considered it the people would vote them out.

Despotic regimes could commit terrorism. But free government's simply can't. Its an oxy moron. How on earth can it be done?\

Oh and dont think i havent noticed the avoidance of the question.

Just the fact that you include Bush and Sharon in the same breath as Zarqawi, bin Laden et al precludes your last request from ever becomming reality.

And feel free to hate me to your little black heart's content.
 
 
you know....i don't care why they moslems hate us.

i have no time for people that hate.
 
 
 
Sir; u prove u hate us, try 2 b equitable,
I believe in the wisdom of ALLAH, there must b the Comeuppance in the day of Judgement.........
trust in The Justness Of ALLAH f u believe n HIM..
tahnk u,,

 

Allah can go suck big camel dick. really. and you too.

Islam is a bloodthirsty religion based on dominance and lies.
 
 
The first question that Muslims should ask is, "Why doesn't the US respect their wishes in respect to how the world should run?"

There are many answers for this, but the bumper-sticker version would sound like this.

The Muslim World refuses to sieze a destiny, instead they sieze the past with both hands and attempt to force the rest of the world to conform to that violent and destructive past. They then blame others for the fact that they live in 13th century squalor with violent dictators pushing nothing close to religion onto the people (yet they call it religion) and when people make alliances to help them into the present they begin to blow up innocent people because that present doesn't fit into such a narrow world view.

You trying to imply he is compensating for something?:p:

I have to agree with manu. I don't care why other people hate me. I know I am a decent fellow and if they hate me its because of some problem with them and not me.

In fact, I would say let them continue to hate me. Except they have turned their hate into violence against an innocent people. They have become murderers because of their hatred. If they left us alone we wouldn't bother them. But they intend to wage war on us so we have no choice but to defend ourselves. In the end, there hands will be covered in all the innocent blood they have killed for starting this unjust war against us.
