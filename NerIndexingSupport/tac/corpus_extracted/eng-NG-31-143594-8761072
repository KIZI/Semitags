The Doris Duke Charitable Foundation
DDCF Climate Change Initiative
The DDCF has launched a $100-million grant-making initiative to help build a clean-energy economy that can reduce the threat of global climate change to people and the environment. The five-year initiative is focused on accelerating the adoption of available, practical approaches to reducing carbon emissions. The goal is to develop policies to bring off-the-shelf and new clean-energy technologies to market fasterâ€”including everything from building codes to policies that put a price on carbon.
