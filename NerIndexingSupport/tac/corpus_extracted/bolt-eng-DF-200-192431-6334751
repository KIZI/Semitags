muslim population?

There are over 1.5 billion muslims compared to lets say 14 million jews.. But I see more jewish actors,singers and celebs compared to muslim ones..

Also there are even fewer muslim female actresses, why is this so?

Are there really that restricted? I honestly can't think of a single famous female muslim celeb or even a sports star(Sania Mirza being an exception).

I'm not saying there should be 'sluts' and you can still be a celeb by dressing modestly and not drinking and partying.

Young muslim girls need role models but there hardly are any.

Furthermore, to those people that will say it it is haraam then how come there are still many famous muslim male actors and singers eg. Akon, Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes etc.

Name me one famous muslim female celeb/sports star? cause I'm really struggling

I'm sure out of half a 1.5 billion population there always one or two that want to become a celeb.
 
 
Only 1st thread and post, and you already know what to talk about, Islam  
 
 
Cher Lloyd's so stupid she can't even spell her own surname.
 
 
I'd much rather have a lot of Muslim females take on IMPORTANT careers such as surgeons, lawyers, engineers, and teachers (which they tend to do, thankfully) rather than become waste of space celebrities, like we haven't got enough. There are a lot of low-key Muslim female actresses and singers in Arab countries (music and soap operas are big business in the Middle East & North Africa) but Muslim women generally have far too much humility to parade themselves around Hollywood.
Regardless, I'll name you a few fairly well known "Muslim" female celebrities: Amal Berrabah from Sugababes was brought up in a Moroccan Muslim family, so was that Laila Rouass from Footballer's Wives (yet she insists she's Asian)
 
 
They have dignity.
 
 
Unrelated but I find it funny that because they said a couple of things about islam, some rappers are suddenly muslim despite still doing and making videos about alcohol and other unislamic things.
 
 
Erm, why is it important for them to be celebrities?  
 
 
This has nothing to do with the content in your post, but please can you stop 'singing'?
 
 
This idea of having an actor/singer/sports player as a role model is stupid tbh. Mother Teresa over lady Gaga imo.

Yes religion is a massive factor as too why you don't get many Muslim western female actors. But there aren't that many male ones either.

It's so blatantly chav princess. Next she'll be making threads about x factor and wearing uni hoodies.

True but that doesn't mean they're not Muslim.

You would imagine that they would make their shahadda a bit more public since they make everything else in their life public. The only evidence I have is a wiki article and youtube video about them talking a bit about islam. As far as I'm aware rapping "arab money" does not make you a muslim.

I think being a "sstaaarr" (in the words of muhamad deedat) is looked down in the muslim community..... women, whatever their achievement are bought down to a sexual level, if marketable in such a way and this is something which doesn't fit well with islam and muslims..

I Didn't even know they were Muslims until just a few months ago when someone told me and I doubt most Muslims even know that they are Muslims.

Busta Rhymes is a 5percenter not exactly islam... Nation of gods and earths is an entirely different doctrine, but the ignorant would never know this!

Also do many christians still not do other things they are not supposed to? people of religion all of one thing in common, actually make that all humans, we all posses the capability to sin! stop being so ignorant.. so an atheist murders people, does that mean all atheists should murder? going by your stupid logic they should..
 
 
It's sort of like bollywood. They're famous in their countries but not so much in the west.

whether you like it or not, agree with it or not celebrities are influencial people especially to younger people. We dont hold as a rule the same accolade to doctors (and we sure as hell have enough lawyers) that we used to. Celebrities fill this gap, and some female muslim celebrities are something that muslim women could adhere to be.

Busta Rhymes is not a Muslim, he's a member of The Nation of Gods and Earths which is not Islam. Akon, I'm not sure if he's actually a Muslim or a member of the nation of Islam (which again is not a part of Islam despite the name). If he is a Muslim he's a bad one, his lifestyle goes completely against the religion. Ice Cube is a Muslim but I know nothing about his career. If his lyrics are clean, and his music videos aren't promiscuous, depending on which school of thought you follow he's not doing anything wrong. The only famous muslim male I can think of, who still devoutly follows Islam is Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens). There are plenty of famous muslims (male and female) outside western media, who most kids from muslim famillies will be exposed to. However to look for aspiring role models in celebrities seems a bit redundant to me.

I am a Muslim girl, I didn't grow up looking for role models in celebrities. The only person outside my family who I ever aspired to be like was a fictional character. Kids shouldn't be looking for role-models in entertainers, if they are their parents should steer them in another direction. I do think Muslim girls need role models of successful muslim women (outside celebrity culture). As a teen I found myself looking up to people like Riz Latif, and Fatima Bhutto. If anything, when I saw a famous muslim celeb I was let down more than inspired because almost none of them actually follow the religious teachings - which always made me feel like the only way you can be successful is if you compromise your beliefs. Something I was not willing to do.

Also Islam is restrictive when it comes to careers in public media. A man/woman can be an actor as long as he/she preserves the rules of Islam, so no intimate scenes at all, and wearing appropriate clothes - hard to do in an acting carrer. Same with singing lyrics have to be clean, videos shouldn't be sexualised at all, and depending on which school you follow, you can't use certain instruments either.

There's also the fact that Jews have an established history in cinema and entertainment. They have always dominated Hollywood. Muslims have never been a notable part of the western entertainment industry.
 
 
this whole "celebrity" or "star" concept is a western secular invention. Its not something which would be promoted in muslim countries.... gender roles and matters of equality vary greatly in the two socities. I'm sure there are muslim female "celebs" (but not in our western sense).... There are bound to be famous persian, asian,arab women of muslim heritage who are famous for singing etc in their home countries...

as for britian, give it time and I'm sure there will be muslim female "celebs" (doesn't take much to be a "celeb" in britain)..... mostly just get some arse and tits out!

This topic reminded me of a interesting more4 documentary about the afghan idol show (singing talent show)..

Watch the video below from 5:30-6:00 to understand a popular muslim view about women celebs/actresses etc...

the guy cracks me up in the way he pronounces and exaggerates the words 'car' and 'star'!

You go on and on about muslim girls not slumming it as celebrities yet the asian celebrities that you then proudly state are ones from awful girl bands and awful wag tv shows...
 
 
Maybe there are hardly any famous muslims over here because the white population and agencies favor blonde, white women? Not saying it's right by any means, but it probably happens
 
 
There are plenty of role models for muslim girls on the islamic channels and you see plenty on the asian channels. The reason you don't know about them is because they aren't famous in the western countries. I wouldn't want a muslim role model who goes against the teachings of islam anyway.
 
 
I think that you'd find a lot of Muslim celebrities in the Pakistan media industry?

Example:
Mona Lizza-she is so pretty!  
 

Konnie Huq is a British Muslim TV presenter and besides I see a lot of news readers/presenters who happen to be Muslim (I can tell that they are Muslim and not just brown and I do my research   ).  

EDIT: I'd appreciate it if someone gave me reason as to why the think that my post is neg-worthy.

this may be a factor, but I believe the significant factor is the influence the parents/familly have over their sons and daughters, (especially the daughters) and their chosen career paths/professions...

I beleive the parents/family are the main factor which prevent asian women/girls from chasing a career in "media"..... konnie huq was interviewed during her stint on bluepeter and she said that her parents weren't happy with her move into presenting to start with (preferred her to continue her academic path)

would a female "muslim role model" have to cover her hair and boobs?

boobs definitely, hair is a very controversial issue. I guess if you're going to be going on tv a headscarf would be good but i wouldn't judge if a woman didn't wear one. Boobs though for sure should be covered for muslim women, tv or not.

Although this may be part of the reason it is not the main reason. Believe it or not young muslims are starting to become more conservative than the older generation. I had a debate about this topic (whether a muslim kid should go into a acting/singing career) with my parents not too long ago - they were of the opinion that whilst it's not an ideal career they wouldn't get too wound up about it as long as the religion was still preserved. Whilst I was of the opinion that it should be avoided because it will ultimately lead to the individual having to compromise their religion. Konnie's parents weren't happy with her career choice but they let her get on with it. In fact Haq is a perfect example of a muslim who has eventually compromised her religion for the progression of her career.

 
would a female &quot;muslim role model&quot; have to cover her hair and boobs?

 

Of course she would have to cover her breasts, she wouldn't be much of a 'Muslim role model' if she didn't. It sends out the wrong message to young muslim girls if they don't. One that says 'hey if you want to get were I am shed your clothes'.
 
 
You have a very English-language-centric view of the world. Who do you think plays female roles on Arabic television?

Secondly, it's not really a rellgious matter. There are more East Asians than there are Muslims, how many East Asian celebrities do you know? Not that many I'd guess.

And those Muslims saying Muslim women don't do this stuff because they have dignity - very naive, most Muslim woman have no more dignity than non-Muslim women, there will ALWAYS be an abundant supply of Muslim women willing to strip off for the camera (and sleep with whoever they need to sleep with to get famous).
 
 
 
women, whatever their achievement are bought down to a sexual level, if marketable in such a way and this is something which doesn't fit well with islam and muslims..

 

True. Compared to men, an extremely high proportion of female celebrities end up being sexualised in some way, and are often far more recognised for their sex appeal than whatever talent they had that got them celebrity status in the first place. (In fact, in many cases, sex appeal was the "talent" that got them celebrity status in the first place).

As you say, it doesn't fit too well with Islam.

she wasn't even devout to begin with..... the issue of her faith being compromised was not an issue to her..... there aren't any "muslim celebs" who haven't compromised their faith in way of their career.

You (or someone else) claimed that that moroccan sugar babe and laila rouass are muslim celebs but I wouldn't really class them as such as their religous cultural heritage isn't part of their celebrity. A "muslim celeb" (esp female) cannot be a "muslim role model".... these two things are opposites.

I agree there aren't many muslim celebs who haven't compromised their religion - that's the point I was trying to make. I disagree that there aren't any muslim celebs who haven't compromised their faith. People like Zain Bhikha are excellent muslim role models.

I don't know who those people are so it definitley wasn't me who said that. Muslim and celebrity are not antithetical, although they can only co-exist in rare circumstances. I've only seen it work with Nasheed artists and (famous) academics.

I'm taking about "celebrity" as we know it in the west.... Zain bhika may well be a celeb in the muslim world and so in that sense he hasn't compromised his faith (he does sing types of islamic songs.... so his career and celeb identity is linked to his islamic faith....... there aren't any muslim celebs who celeb career is linked to their faith and this was the point which I was making (esp in mainstream western media)

they are with our western modern definition of celebrity and all that it entails (all that social networking in a "haram environment" )..... some muslims "scholars" may liken it to "sleeping with the devil" !  
 
 
There are many female muslim celebrities. The idea of western celebrities does not really go with being a muslim and celebrity. These female 'celebrities' are well known in the muslim community. The major difference is that they are not known for their entertainment or showbiz like it is in the west. is it more of how they benefitted the community or did something to help give a better image of Islam. The muslims that were mentioned above are not really seen as celebrities in the muslim world, because their appearance is of a not practising muslims.
As for role models, there is only ONE main role model for muslims and that is Prophet Muhammad and for the ladies the role models are the heavenly ladies i.e. Fatima daughter of the Prophet, Khadija the wife of Prophet and but not least the granddaughter of the Prophet Zainab. You might think that these are the ladies of the past, and not relevant today, but i assure u reading about their life and advice is as relevant as it is today.

Oh right, but she still could be Muslim even if she marries a non muslim.
 
 
All these Muslims saying that Muslim women have 'dignity', you are pathetic  

Are you seriously suggesting every actress, singer, sports-person, host etc is some sort of disgusting slut?

Or you just mad? You jelly eh?

Ok the only way of not being a Muslim anymore is committing the biggest sin which is shirk. Haha @ coincidentally.
 
 
There are lots and lots of Muslim actors and actresses. Egyptians (who are Arabs) are renowned for their skills in acting (and hence lots of Arab actors are Egyptian), in fact so much so that arab programmes such as soaps, films, dramas, etc are commonly full of Egyptian actors; and since the whole arab world likes to watch TV as well, as a result the Egyptian arabic dialect is one of the most known and understood out of all the arabic dialects.

Lots of Muslims are arabs (myself included) and so the reason why you fail to see lots of Muslim actors is because they are all well known in the Arab world and the Middle East, and not in places such as America or the UK.
If you spoke arabic, and watched arabic TV, and immersed yourself in Arab culture, you would know who the Arab celebrities and actors are

If you are thinking that all Muslim actors are super religious, then you are wrong. However due to cultural differences you wont (or will struggle to) find kissing, dirty scenes or that kind of thing in Arab films and TV shows.
 
 
I do wonder how Muslims would react if there was say a famous Muslim female singer in the west?
 
 
 
Cher Lloyd's so stupid she can't even spell her own surname.

 

LOL!

yeh, her family are those "rah" pakistani types.... religion is just a cultural thing.

wouldn't really happen.... she may be of a muslim background or heritage but wouldn't be a practising muslim.

I'm sure there are famous female singers in muslims countries but then there it is more about the voice whereas in the west its more about what she looks like and how much tits and arse she reveals (no doubt this is a trend which may be catching on in certain muslim countries)

The Bollywood movie industry is the second biggest movie industry in the world film industry. I don't see a lack of famous muslim women at all.
 
 
You're only noticing this, because in Western society it is rare to see either a male or female muslim celebrity. I can name a few whose names are still pretty popular; Konnie Huq (Blue Peter), Amir Kahn, and Zayn Malik (One Direction). I think Zayn in particular is a very good role model to all young men regardless of what faith they are. The way he dealt with the tragedy in his family recently, shows that he is still a very grounded, kind person and has not let the fame go to his head at all.

wtf? how would you expect him to act if the fame had gotten to him. His is just as much a "role model" as any of the other guys in their band.... then again I wouldn't call any of them role models
 
 
 
doesn't even make sense. I'm not gonna think for you either.

cheryl cole is not part indian.... its funny how certain indians or asians try and claim some sort of "attachment" to somone through shared ethnicity (even if not true)...

oh do your own research. i say one thing then everybody wants to get a stiffy and get hyper.

shes like quarter indian. You can even tell by looking at her and it's true.

Google Cheryl Coles brother then tell me if he not mixed.

Spanish people don't look Indian..   your talking about Gypsies...Like Jose Mourinho...Who is not Portguese.

Gypsies in the meditarenean claim they're spanish when they are homeless thieves who descend from Middle eastern/Indo tribes.

All these Muslims saying that Muslim women have 'dignity', you are pathetic  

Are you seriously suggesting every actress, singer, sports-person, host etc is some sort of disgusting slut?

Or you just mad? You jelly eh?

 

Not everyone but yeah that is usually perception of Pakistani female anchors on TV, that they got there by sleeping their way through the TV industry males. Today it's changing somewhat, if they have husbands and children it automatically means they're in the good books.

well they all certainly don't look alike... certainly are not all pale skinned with light hair/eyes.... gypsies/latino or whatever they may be... I'm guessing cher lloyd and cherly cole have romani blood in them (they look alike in their colouring).... there is a link between a part of india and the gypsies in europe

who are you? and what is this denial over who is what or who is not?

people be confused about ethnicity. even to the point of making up terms like Peruvian-English. or Italian - Puerto Rican.

quite funny how new ethnicities are created on the spot nowdays.

its more about people trying to claim an ethnicity... with regards to cheryl cole, there isn't any evidence that she is part indian... for all we know she could be part "spanish" !

spanish folk are white....

you don't need light hair and eyes to be white. Meditarenean race is a sub-race in the Caucasian race the same as the Aryan catergory.

Having darker skin by tanning doesn't change your race. You wouldn't call a pale Jap/Chinese white would we.

Even Middle Easteners are classed as caucasian. Caucasian means bone structure.

listen here. she has said that she is indian. it is well known.

you can tell by looking at her aswell. So when i was told this info it did not get up my shirt nor suprise me.

i've had enough of talking about Cheryl Cole anyway.

She can slurp on Ashleys unfaithfull dong for all i care.

my parents can be pretty cool (at times)

 

I meant how you survived her parents?

her parents are those moden liberal pakistani rah types, not the (majority) village types.

well they go to mosque and stuff and do all that other religous associated stuff, but yeah not very "religous" like other pakistani families.

her parents are more westernised as they come from a wealthy pakistani family and they've travelled and experinced different cultures throughout their lives whcih I guess has made them more liberal.
 
 
According to what I have heard, Busta Rhymes practices the teachings of the 5 percenters/NOI, if this is true, he is not a Muslim.

Also, I have heard Ice Cube say he doesn't believe in ''rituals'' such as salah, zakah etc, if this is true, he isn't a Muslim either.. I can name you some former rappers that are though:

The one on the left is Loon before his conversion to Islam, the one on the right is him recently. What a change!

He is in prison at the moment in Belgium relating to things from his previous life (probably drugs/gun smuggling) or something..

I did do my research, and I didn't find anything about her being Indian, anywhere on the internet. So before I concluded you are lying, I asked you where you got your information from.

Apparently you don't have any info either, you bull****ter. Just because someone has brown hair and brown eyes doesn't mean they're Indian.

Even Middle Easteners are classed as caucasian. Caucasian means bone structure.

 

The three Caucasoid sub-races are the Semites, Aryans and Hamites.

Caucasus = a mountain range. Caucasian means someone from the Caucasus.

Bone structure is one of the things Caucasoids have in common with one another.

(And just FYI, Middle Easterners are more 'Caucasian' than you.)

Jesus Christ, you must be a troll.
 
 
coincidence?  
does it matter?
