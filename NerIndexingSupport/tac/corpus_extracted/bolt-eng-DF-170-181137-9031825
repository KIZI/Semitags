qatar.
 
 
Pretty amazing.

Qatar has a population of San Antonio and is smaller in size than Connecticut. Its hard to believe that FIFA would award the World Cup to such a small country.

They better pray gas doesn't fall to $2 or they're fracked.

Soccer is a third world sport. The fact that FIFA thumbed their nose at a Marxist Kenyan not once, but twice, says a lot.
 
 
At least Qatar can offer up some hot looking cheerleaders!

Yea... and the US have the 'World Series' in baseball.... how many countries exactly participate in that?

The rest of the world play soccer. Just because it's not that huge in the US does not make it a third world sport. It does, however, make you an idiot.
