I have been pondering this.

Sarah Palin is extremely knowledgeable.

  YouTube - Sarah Palin Speech at the Southern GOP Conference 

I don't think anyone who heard her speak at the SRLC can deny that. And she did it without a teleprompter.

We know that the radical left wingers shot all their ammo at her, attacking her children, attacking her as a mom, trying to portray her as stupid, yadda, yadda, yadda. They did this because they consider her a grave threat. The question we should ask ourselves is why do they consider her such a threat?

We also know that Obama is dumber than a rock.

He is the twit that has been embracing america's enemies, and alienating america's friends.

He is the twit that wants to raise all sorts of taxes in a bad economy.

He is the twit that wants to micromanage the private sector and thinks this won't lead lead to economic collapse.

So here is my question. Do you think that she is now immune fromthe viciousness of the liberal attacks in 3 years? Has she developed the antibodies? or do you think that they successfully destroyed her by being the evil vermin tha liberals are?

I do feel that she can do a great job. She did great for Alaska. She had 80% approval, took on corruption in her own party, cut spending even when there was a surplus in the Alaskan budget, lowered taxes, gave tax rebates to Alaskans., etc.
 
 
OK. Please send me a bumper sticker. I'll vote for her. Seeing as how Owe Bama proves you don't have to have any particular skill to become President, she should be a shoe-in. I'll vote for her simply because she's cute, she's clever, she's very witty and she knows how to field dress a moose. Owe Bama is none of these things. The only thing he knows how to do is play basketball and fly around at government expense on his self-fullfilling ego inhancement trips.
 
 
I'm with AmwayMike on this one

Palin would make a wonderful Republican candidate for President

Run Sarah........RUN
 
 
Lets not dumb down politics any more.
 
 
'Knowledgeable' is the measure?

Is she more knowledgeable than Romney? Ron Paul? Tim Pawlenty? Newt Gingrich? Mike Huckabee? Haley Barbour?...to name a few...
 
 
Anyone with half a brain, google, some time, not mention a bunch of people to help them, is 'knowledgeable' nowadays.

She did not lower taxes in Alaska. She imposed a windfall profits tax on oil and gave everyone in Alaska a handout. It's easy to buy an 80% approval rating with that kind of money to pass aroun.

Speaking of 80%, 80% of Alaska's state budget is paid for by oil revenues. A chimpanzee could handle Alaska's fiscal policy.

What would a democrat congress do with more money? They would spend it. Sarah Palin gave it back to the people it belonged to in the first place. That IS very refreshing.
 
 
She is a dumb fucking cunt.
Those who vote for, or think she is wise, are fucking themselves in el culo.

Right-on target AmwayMike!

Sarah Palin offers the best the Republican Party has to offer.

She is the most intellectual Republican out there. Add her charm, wit and lets face it...she looks great in a bikini

The telepromter reading, muslim, socialist, marxist, facist, white hating, anti-american Obama would not have a prayer against someone of Palins calibre.

So, along with AmwayMike...I urge ALL Republicans to support Sarah Palin

You Betcha!

Bullshit. You are right though, when oil goes down it devastates Alaska's economy. Kind of like it devastates Iran's economy. Sarah Palin's 'executive experience' makes her a better candidate to be president of Iran.

Btw, reference the highlighted, Governor Palin sided with ALASKA DEMOCRATS against her own party, to pass the windfall profits tax on oil that was handed out to the state's residents.
 
 
Palin came in a distant third in the Southern Republican Leadership Conference straw poll, barely beating Newt Gingrich. Romney won without showing up, lol.

If Obama proposed placing a tax on oil companies and then giving the proceeds to the public, you wouldn't call it "letting people keep more of their own money". You'd denounce it as radical socialism. If Saint Sarah of the Snow does it though, you're all for it.
 
 
Palin isn't going to run for President.

She's just astute enough to know that her bottom line (from speaking engagements) is tied to the perception that she will run for president and the second she makes a definitive statement that she will not run for president, it's going to cost her money.

She's keeping the gravy train rolling.

Obama would spend it.
 
 
If sound bytes and slogans without a single idea are examples of the "new" Republican intellectualism. Then for sure, she is the best Republicans have to offer.

Run Sarah, run - to the nearest book. Read it. Study it. Learn what "words" mean. Find out what it's like reading from a "page" instead of your "hand".

Sarah herself admitted that it wasn't until she was being prepped for the Vice Presidential debate that she was "told" that Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11. Could you be any more dumb?
 
 
4 more years of Obama if she's the candidate

You constantly lie about what Palin did.

 
For those attacking Governor Palin for raising taxes on oil companies in Alaska, the facts tell a much different story. After rampant corruption was stopped and criminal politicians, along with oil executives, fined and/or thrown in jail, Sarah Palin set out to reverse the damage done. Here is the Palin tax proposal before Alaska's legislature got a hold of it. This is what Sarah Palin is responsible for on the issue of oil industry taxes in Alaska:

The basic elements of the Palin tax proposal, called Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share, are:

• 25 percent tax on net profits, or the value of the oil minus operating expenses and pipeline and tanker charges. That compares with the 22.5 percent Petroleum Profits Tax passed in 2006. The tax rate rises when oil prices are high.

• Protection when oil prices are low. The big fields of Kuparuk and Prudhoe Bay would pay at least a 10 percent gross tax on the oil's value. This tax on the gross -- before operating expenses are deducted -- would be instead of a tax on net profits, not in addition to it.

• Changes in allowable tax credits and deductions. Producers no longer could write off the cost of replacing deteriorating pipelines.

• Higher salaries for oil tax auditors.

• More information for the state from oil producers and better sharing of information between state agencies.

What you see above is where the $1200 tax rebate came from that sent to the people of Alaska who were robbed by politicians convicted of taking bribes from oil company executives. When you read the actual proposal instead giving a knee-jerk reaction to a tax increase, it is clear this isn't a tax hike near as much as it is returning stolen money back to taxpayers. Not only was there bribery, but her predecessor was giving special breaks to oil companies as Palin stated in this report from FoxNews referencing both McCain and the Governor:

Palin supports offshore drilling like McCain, but they diverge on drilling in the off-limits Artic Wildlife National Refuge. She’s for it and he’s against it, although he’s said he is willing to re-examine the issue.

They both oppose a national windfall profits tax on oil companies, saying it would hinder domestic production. But she raised taxes on oil companies in Alaska last year, arguing that her predecessor, Frank Murkowski gave them too many breaks.

When asked by FOXNews.com whether McCain’s criticism of Obama’s similar proposal to tax oil companies was a contradiction to Palin’s actions last year, McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds batted the question away.

Governor Palin did what any conservative worth their own soul would have done. She gave tax dollars that were literally stolen from Alaskan taxpayers right back to them and appropriately reversed corrupt tax policy. Not only did she bring ethics back to the tax policy in regards to the oil industry in Alaska, she improved the policy itself in her proposal.

If Palin runs in 2012 I believe she will hand Barry another four years. She needs to marinate more... perhaps a presidential run down the road, but not in 2012.

A classic example of the irrational devotion that Palin inspires. And you win a neg rep for calling me a liar.

Marinate how and where? She surrendered her post that was giving her "executive experience".

That's what I don't get. Palin is no longer gaining any leadership experience and you guys think she is going to age like fine wine?

She might become more polished in her appearance and speeches, but she will have less experience (by virtue of being out of office for so long) and that was her supposed major selling point.

How do you guys reconcile this?

You are partially right Mike but are so wrong in this area:
EVERYTHING you have comes via truck. Trucking is vital to the economy. When oil goes up trucking suffers and it kills the economy and affects every goods and service you receive.
The price of oil affects all three of my businesses all in a negative way.
But you are right in this angle. If oil falls below somewhere in the $65 a barrell area they want to cut production and that kills the economy at the low price. Slowing of production of Saudi and middle eastern fields always raises the price dramatically like we saw when it was $4.50 a galolon for gas.

I completely agree. I meant the budget for Alaska which relies so heavily on the oil industry.

I concur that the price of oil going up isn't good for business in general.

In Alaska, the people get a dividend check from the government for drilling "their" oil reserves. In other words, the Alaska government taxes the oil companies then distributes that money to the people.

Its very socialist.
 
 
Possibly someone should go back to NYcarbineer's post that White Female Palin is Number Three as the Southern Republican Convention presidential choice, whereas White Maie Gingrich is Number Two, and White Male Romeny is Number One!

Maybe there is a problem with the McCain-Palin assertion that the economy was "strong," after the Bush Administration, Mega-Giant Government Bail-outs of $1.65 tril. That counts starting in 2008 with Bear-Stearns?

Mostly, anyone would conclude maybe so, if probably not!

Light-Skinned black Obama, with no Negro dialect(?), by comparison: Only did $1.150 tril. in smaller government bail-outs, starting with the government preservantive stimulus package: If anyone does understand about molasses.?

Even Southerners know about finger-licking good, if not too much about flippin' the finger, at the Republicans, where blame for giant, mega-government belongs!

Tell yourself that. Gingrich was correct. You guys need to come up with a workable platform or your gains in 2010 will be modest, at best.

Yeah, "nationalizing" private profits is about as socialistic of a concept as they come.

It's also the epitome of patronage.

Of course, when you deal with the Sarah love affair, logic falls behind the wayside.

Love is tricky like that.

What you see above is where the $1200 tax rebate came from that sent to the people of Alaska who were robbed by politicians convicted of taking bribes from oil company executives. When you read the actual proposal instead giving a knee-jerk reaction to a tax increase, it is clear this isn't a tax hike near as much as it is returning stolen money back to taxpayers. Not only was there bribery, but her predecessor was giving special breaks to oil companies as Palin stated in this report from FoxNews referencing both McCain and the Governor:

Palin supports offshore drilling like McCain, but they diverge on drilling in the off-limits Artic Wildlife National Refuge. She’s for it and he’s against it, although he’s said he is willing to re-examine the issue.

They both oppose a national windfall profits tax on oil companies, saying it would hinder domestic production. But she raised taxes on oil companies in Alaska last year, arguing that her predecessor, Frank Murkowski gave them too many breaks.

When asked by FOXNews.com whether McCain’s criticism of Obama’s similar proposal to tax oil companies was a contradiction to Palin’s actions last year, McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds batted the question away.

Governor Palin did what any conservative worth their own soul would have done. She gave tax dollars that were literally stolen from Alaskan taxpayers right back to them and appropriately reversed corrupt tax policy. Not only did she bring ethics back to the tax policy in regards to the oil industry in Alaska, she improved the policy itself in her proposal.

From what I have read, I think she did a decent job as governor, or at least in the 2+ years she was there, in particular, her taking on the corruption of politicians and the oil industry. She should be credited for improving tax policy.

Having said that, the article is disingenuous. It makes it sound as if the money being distributed to Alaskans was money that otherwise was being stolen. In fact, relative to the total amount, most of the money distributed to Alaskans was from a mechanistic pre-set formula, which triggered an increase because of rising oil prices, regardless of what she did.
 
 
 
 
 
Guess what happens when oil goes down? It devastates the economy.

And letting people keep more of their own money is not a handout.

What would a democrat congress do with more money? They would spend it. Sarah Palin gave it back to the people it belonged to in the first place. That IS very refreshing.

 

In Alaska, the people get a dividend check from the government for drilling "their" oil reserves. In other words, the Alaska government taxes the oil companies then distributes that money to the people.

Its very socialist.

 

Yeah, "nationalizing" private profits is about as socialistic of a concept as they come.

It's also the epitome of patronage.

Of course, when you deal with the Sarah love affair, logic falls behind the wayside.

Love is tricky like that.

 

I would generally agree that sending a check to every Alaskan is a better way of distributing the money instead of automatically increasing government spending. However, the key to understanding the concept of the policy is that the oil is "theirs," i.e. all of Alaskans, not the oil companies'. The concept is quite collectivist. It is the same argument Leftists use elsewhere in the world for nationalizing oil reserves outright. Instead, in Alaska, the people just take "their" money.
 
 
Palin is the former mediocre Guv of a small State, a neocon, a self-admitted zionist and not particularly upstanding in her personal life. SURELY conservatives (the real ones, not the Israel Firsters) can find a better Standard Bearer for 2012.
 
 
 
I have been pondering this.

Sarah Palin is extremely knowledgeable.

 YouTube - Palin SRLC - Part 1 

 YouTube - Sarah Palin Speech at the Southern GOP Conference 

I don't think anyone who heard her speak at the SRLC can deny that. And she did it without a teleprompter.

We know that the radical left wingers shot all their ammo at her, attacking her children, attacking her as a mom, trying to portray her as stupid, yadda, yadda, yadda. They did this because they consider her a grave threat. The question we should ask ourselves is why do they consider her such a threat?

We also know that Obama is dumber than a rock.

He is the twit that has been embracing america's enemies, and alienating america's friends.

He is the twit that wants to raise all sorts of taxes in a bad economy.

He is the twit that wants to micromanage the private sector and thinks this won't lead lead to economic collapse.

So here is my question. Do you think that she is now immune fromthe viciousness of the liberal attacks in 3 years? Has she developed the antibodies? or do you think that they successfully destroyed her by being the evil vermin tha liberals are?

I do feel that she can do a great job. She did great for Alaska. She had 80% approval, took on corruption in her own party, cut spending even when there was a surplus in the Alaskan budget, lowered taxes, gave tax rebates to Alaskans., etc.

 

Oh Yes....Please Please Yes. With Moose Blood and dying turkeys on top. The woman is a quitter, left Wasilla broke and made victims pay for their own rape kits.

She is about as smart as a stale soda cracker.

You are partially right Mike but are so wrong in this area:
EVERYTHING you have comes via truck. Trucking is vital to the economy. When oil goes up trucking suffers and it kills the economy and affects every goods and service you receive.
The price of oil affects all three of my businesses all in a negative way.
But you are right in this angle. If oil falls below somewhere in the $65 a barrell area they want to cut production and that kills the economy at the low price. Slowing of production of Saudi and middle eastern fields always raises the price dramatically like we saw when it was $4.50 a galolon for gas.

 

I completely agree. I meant the budget for Alaska which relies so heavily on the oil industry.

I concur that the price of oil going up isn't good for business in general.

 

Alaska doesn't 'rely' on the oil revenue, it benefits from them. I doubt many states would not welcome the opportunity to 'rely' on natural resources to pay for 80% of the cost of their state's government. Alaska also gets a disproportionate amount of federal money.

All things considered, AK is probably the easiest state to be governor of.
 
 
Palin does not want supporters who call individuals they disagree with retarded.

Palin has a special need child. She is disgusted by individuals that are disrespectful and insensitive to individuals with special needs and their families.

CMike is one of those individuals.

If she decides to run, she'll win in a landslide

She's been totally vetted by the LMSM and she is as Conservative as is electable in 2012
 
 
 
 
If Palin runs in 2012 I believe she will hand Barry another four years. She needs to marinate more... perhaps a presidential run down the road, but not in 2012.

 

Marinate how and where? She surrendered her post that was giving her "executive experience".

That's what I don't get. Palin is no longer gaining any leadership experience and you guys think she is going to age like fine wine?

She might become more polished in her appearance and speeches, but she will have less experience (by virtue of being out of office for so long) and that was her supposed major selling point.

How do you guys reconcile this?

 

Who's to say that she is going to continue with what's she's currently doing? Who's to say she won't run for something else? I have no idea what she plans to do, do you? She won't one day magically be more experienced, she needs to acquire more. She needs more ah, seasoning. If she chooses not to get more? I don't think she has a chance of winning if she runs for potus.
 
 
Remember, by the time she does run in 2012, the readership at the NY Times will decrease by another 50%-70% and CNN might only be running Billy Mays and Sham Wow commercials.

She did not lower taxes in Alaska. She imposed a windfall profits tax on oil and gave everyone in Alaska a handout. It's easy to buy an 80% approval rating with that kind of money to pass aroun.

Speaking of 80%, 80% of Alaska's state budget is paid for by oil revenues. A chimpanzee could handle Alaska's fiscal policy.

She isn't going to run in 2010. That leaves her about a year to file, run for, win, and serve in office before she would have to start campaigning for 2012.

Probably not-so-ironically, her timing would have been perfect if she had stayed on as governor of Alaska.

She's not going to run. Palin was astute enough to cash in on her gravy train when her popularity was high. She knows that the second she declares she isn't going to run in 2012 (which she'll have to do eventually), her stock will plummet. I predict she'll string along the voters as far as she can.

Frankly, I think she enjoys the celebrity far more than the responsibility. I can't say I blame her. Work is hard. Popularity is fun.

So, she isn't going to run and it will be the best thing for the GOP.

Yeah, I see that now. Frankly, I think her time in public office is over. I was certain she'd vie for the Senate seat in Alaska, but she chose not to do that.

Really, I think the act of quitting was political suicide for her.

I tend to agree, although we're talking about the least qualified man (and his Administration) to ever hold the office of President.
 
 
This is why I wish she would run, quitting was a stroke of genius.

If she stayed, she'd be in court the next 2 years until the Dems finally gets something to stick and she could not fight back adequately or effectively.

By leaving she's doing what she does best as the GOP main battle tank: she's out in the open picking off targets at will and driving for the enemy command and control

So far, just like a year and a half ago, the only effective "weapon" against her is Tina Fey and mark my words, if she chooses to Palin will level Fey with a single quip.

Alaska main industry is oil. So when the oil market is really good the Alaskan budget has a surplus. When Sarah Palin first became pres. her legistature wanted to spend it of course. Palin, on the other hand, when they had a surplus returned money to the taxpayers.

Anyone see Obama bin Biden or his minions doing this?

Palin has serious achievements. Obama, after a year in office, with super majorities in congress, did nothing but screw up the economy, and is totally screwing up foreign policy.

I would put Palin instead of Obama anyday.
 
 
Oh i agree with whatever the OP and other Palin supporters are saying. Please run Palin in 2012. Please do so. In fact, run Palin as an independent, leader of the "Tea Party" movement. That'll guarantee Obama will lose in 2012.

Now she can fight back.

The cognitive dissonance from the right on this is hilarious.

Palin quit due to some brilliant political master-stroke?

Whatever gets you through the night, Frankie.

I think it's more logical to conclude that Palin quit for the $.

But, hey, I hope you get what you want and she does run. She'll have a tough time explaining how she should be sent to Washington when she couldn't handle the pressures of Anchorage.

Have fun with that.

Though, I suspect we will be spared. Palin knows what she's doing. I suspect she has no intentions of running in 2012.

Private citizens don't run around the country making national commentary. She's a public persona, just as Limbaugh, Beck, Schultz, and the rest of the crew is.

You can't have it both ways. You can't be a celebrity and then when people respond to your public comments cry foul about being a "private citizen".

I believe the trend that has held for many years will have the GOP pick up some seats, but until they have a coherent message, it's going to be modest.

You're opinion is that she is electable. Mine is that she'd get crushed. I suppose it's all speculative.
 
 
 
I don't think that politics is where she thinks she will do the most good for the country. I wouldn't disagree with her on this.

No matter which way you spin it, Alaskans take money from oil companies and give it to themselves, Sarah Palin included. That ain't a "tax cut" no matter which way you spin it. Sorry.

 

Hello?? What do you think taxes are?

Letting taxpayers keep more of their money is a tax reduction  

 

I'll explain this to you how it works.

1.) Alaska government taxes oil companies.
2.) Alaska government takes those taxes and gives it to everyone else in the state.

Or I'll draw a picture.

Money taxed from oil companies ---> goes to ---> Alaskans.

Imagine this scenario.

1.) California government taxes Silicon Valley companies
2.) California government taxes those taxes and gives it to everyone else in the state.

If California did that, I would imagine guys like you would be starting threads about "Communism" and "Socialism" and "Marxism" and "Hitlerism" in California. But, ah, Alaska does it, and its a "tax cut."

Its amazing how the mind can rationalize things, isn't it?
 
 
 
 
hahahah, jealous much.
too bad the state you live in don't give you back money from the Natural Resource they have. they evidently don't think you all are worth it.  

 

Yeah. My state don't give me no oil-welfare either!

 

wow, now the left is complain bout welfare. how bout that.  
too bad the state you live in don't think very highly of you to share in the monies made off the Natural Resource that is your RIGHT not theirs.

good gawd, what a stupid comparison.

poor baby, move to Alaska. but it might be too tough a place for some to live.
I just moved from there after living there since 1993. so believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

Is that you, Bristol Palin?

At any rate, why would I want to live there?

I like it were I am. I guess I can do without the oil welfare.
 
 
I don't know about Sarah in the white house, do we really need to replace one pussy with another?

What is so difficult to understand?

Alaska gets most of it's money in the state budget from oil companies in the form of taxes. If the oil companies are doing well, Alaska collects more revenue. If the oil companies are doing poorly, Alaska collects less revenue.

Alaska then needs to decide what to do with the revenue. Oil companies at the time that Sarah Palin was elected were doing well. Therefore, the Alaska budget had a surplus at this time.

Palin was pressured to spend the money on whatever stuff legislatures piss money away on. Instead of doing that she gave a tax rebate to the people of Alaska.

That is a good thing.
 
 
 
I have been pondering this.

Sarah Palin is extremely knowledgeable.

 YouTube - Palin SRLC - Part 1 

 YouTube - Sarah Palin Speech at the Southern GOP Conference 

I don't think anyone who heard her speak at the SRLC can deny that. And she did it without a teleprompter.

We know that the radical left wingers shot all their ammo at her, attacking her children, attacking her as a mom, trying to portray her as stupid, yadda, yadda, yadda. They did this because they consider her a grave threat. The question we should ask ourselves is why do they consider her such a threat?

We also know that Obama is dumber than a rock.

He is the twit that has been embracing america's enemies, and alienating america's friends.

He is the twit that wants to raise all sorts of taxes in a bad economy.

He is the twit that wants to micromanage the private sector and thinks this won't lead lead to economic collapse.

So here is my question. Do you think that she is now immune fromthe viciousness of the liberal attacks in 3 years? Has she developed the antibodies? or do you think that they successfully destroyed her by being the evil vermin tha liberals are?

I do feel that she can do a great job. She did great for Alaska. She had 80% approval, took on corruption in her own party, cut spending even when there was a surplus in the Alaskan budget, lowered taxes, gave tax rebates to Alaskans., etc.

 

She is great as a motivational speaker and enjoyed as a commentator by many, but for president?? Not even. As much as I like and respect her for many qualities, I cannot see her a leader. She is not experienced enough, and I really doubt that she could ever be. Similar to our current president.
 
 
 
.................By leaving she's doing what she does best as the GOP main battle tank:.....................

 

If she is the best the GOP aka the Zionist Neocon Party (ZNP) can come up with plan on an endless well deserved future as a powerless minority.

Conservatives ya wanna have a future- bury your neocons on the back 40.
 
 
How was Obama experienced enough?
 
 
 
I'm with AmwayMike on this one

Palin would make a wonderful Republican candidate for President

Run Sarah........RUN

 

I second that.

 
 
 
 
LOl, last I checked, the Silicon valley companies isn't a NATURAL RESOUCE.
good gawd, what a stupid comparison.
but you were right on the last half of your post. and proves just where the Obama and the Progressive party are taking us. good one.

 

Its a stupid comparison to you if you are stupid.

Its funny to watch so-called "conservatives" tie themselves in knots over this. Big Government Taxes to give people money is only bad for some industries, but for others, its perfectly fine.
 
 
 
How was Obama experienced enough?

 

He wasn't and isn't! He will go down as the worst in history.
 
 
I'm confused. I thought the libs hated big oil?

Actually another thing that Sarah Palin did was push to make Alaska more competitive for competing oil compaines. Previously, big oil companies leased thousands of acres that were never used. Palin changed that and allowed for more competition.

Big oil hated that and campaigned against her.

I think its a good thing as well. I said in an earlier post that it is generally better for the government to give it to the people than to spend it.

But understand it for what it is - it is a transference of wealth from the profits of oil companies to everybody else. If it was anything else, then the taxes for the oil companies should go lower, not taxes from the oil companies going to Alaskans. It is no different than taxing the profits of Apple or Cisco and giving it directly to everybody else. The only difference is that it is oil rather than hardware or software.

the difference is, the oil companies are drilling and removing a Natural Resource that belongs to the people of the State of Alaska. the Silicon Valley companies are nothing compared to that, but nice try.
 
 
 
 
Palin is the former mediocre Guv of a small State, a neocon, a self-admitted zionist and not particularly upstanding in her personal life. SURELY conservatives (the real ones, not the Israel Firsters) can find a better Standard Bearer for 2012.

 

Go clone Hitler you fucking poseur

 

If he was still alive, he'd fit right it at the tea parties.
 
 
 
 
 
I completely agree. Being a private citizen gives her the freedom to whatever she wants, rather than just be a lightening rod for liberal viciousness.

Now she can fight back.

 

You guys are the only people that consider Palin to be a "private citizen".

 

WELL THEN, what the hell is if she isn't a PRIVATE CITIZEN. she isn't in any elected office of the guberment, now is she.
sheeesh  

 

One doesn't have to be a public official to be a public figure.
 
 
She can be a public figure who is a private citizen.
 
 
 
the difference is, the oil companies are drilling and removing a Natural Resource that belongs to the people of the State of Alaska. the Silicon Valley companies are nothing compared to that, but nice try.

 

So you ARE a collectivist. I thought so.

You and Hugo Chavez have more in common than you think.

yeah, I'm sure ole Hugo is just running out and giving away all that monies he's collecting from the oil company's that he seized by a takeover.

gawd man, get real.
 
 
Hey... she knows a helluva lot more than Obama, who quite frankly, doesn't seem all that bright. Obama is a guy to whom reality is a quaint notion.. he lives in a world of theoreticals, hypotheticals and assorted writings of Marx and Engels and other failed pie in the sky ideas. A true dunderhead.

now you are sounding and looking a little SHRILL DEAR.
and also a little nutty, but hey, if it makes you feel good.  
 
 
WTF?? Ok, the oil belongs to the people.... go drill ya a hole and get ya some and see what good it is to you. Dirt belongs to the people, yet every couple of years I pay to have topsoil delivered to me. I don't refuse to pay for it because it "belongs to me".

What utter dumbfuckery.

Dude, there is a difference between paying a tax to the collective, i.e. the state, for the privilege of using the collective's owned property and paying for value-added throughout the processing chain.

I find it interesting that conservatives believe that the rights of the state supersedes the rights of private property.

Actually, when you look at the difference between conservatives and liberals, it's not much of a surprise. Liberals value individual rights. Conservatives are more for "groups", like corporations. For them, it's OK if some of the "group" die off to promote the welfare of the group.

Conservatives yell, "Death Panel" as a hot button issue. But would it really bother them if it saved insurance companies money?
 
 
Barak Hussein is an utter moron. He never really had a real job or had to meet a payroll.

Sarah Palin has to both.

How is the democrats forcing individuals to buy their version of health care or be subject to IRS penalities championing individual rights?
 
 
 
If she decides to run, she'll win in a landslide

She's been totally vetted by the LMSM and she is as Conservative as is electable in 2012

 

 
 
 
I liked Sarah Palin before she started trying to ride on the Tea Party wagon. I think the movement had more credibility as individual grassroots citizens based on Constitutional values, before this became fuel for onesided Republican politicking against Democrats.

I still think we need a mixed ticket. I would prefer a Conservative or Moderate Republican for President who can work with a Moderate Progressive Democrat as Vice President.

How can you claim to represent all citizens and public interests equally if parties "take turns" controlling executive or legislative branches, and then waste resources fighting instead of cooperating on Constitutional solutions everyone can freely consent to.

All her good points (and the Tea Party's) are lost if this becomes partisan competition. If there was a mixed ticket with goals of mutual cooperation and correction, people might listen instead of shutting each other out to discredit one group and credit another instead.
 
 
Sarah Pailin should definitely run in 2012. I used to think her running mate should be Glenn Beck. But I've changed my mind.

 3397283045_acfc1e0a43.jpgpalin in 2012.jpg 

What a team!!! Come on girls, let's help them achieve victory!!

 
 
 
There is something that's bothering me though. People from the McCain campaign talked about Sarah being very uninformed. This is what Steve Schmidt said:

"Her foreign policy tutors are literally taking her through, 'This is World War I, this is World War II, this is the Korean War. This is the how the Cold War worked.' Steve Schmidt had gone to them and said, 'She knows nothing,'" Heilemann told Cooper. "A week later, after the convention was over, she still didn't really understand why there was a North Korea and a South Korea. She was still regularly saying that Saddam Hussein had been behind 9/11. And, literally, the next day her son was about to ship off to Iraq. And when they asked her who her son was going to fight, she couldn't explain that."

 Revelations from the Campaign - 60 Minutes - CBS News 

Can you imagine that??? As Mike pointed out, Sarah is so very knowledgeable!!! Why would they say these things about her??? Very curious.

 3397283045_acfc1e0a43.jpgpalin in 2012.jpg 
 
 
Yeah, it's amazing how little our Presidential candidates, and VP candidates know about history.
Apparently, it's real important to know this stuff.

I would love to see them all have to take a test and see their scores. We all might be a little surprised by who knows what and how much of it they actually understand.
 
 
Oh Yes....Please Please Yes. With Moose Blood and dying turkeys on top. The woman is a quitter, left Wasilla broke and made victims pay for their own rape kits.

She is about as smart as a stale soda cracker.[/QUOTE]

When will libtards ever get it?

Probably never.

The office of president isn't an academic position at a college or a government technocrat's job. The office of president is a leadership position. This is why BO sucks so horribly bad at it. See, Odummy is a follower by nature and has been all his life. His books are all about the men he has followed and the influence they had on him. He has never held a leadership position in his life prior to being elected TOTUS. Now he is trying to wing it and he obviously isn't up to the task.

Sarah Palin's bio reveals a leader from her childhood up. She has always led and is a major voice in the only political movement of any consequence this cycle. The Republicans will run candidates based on the demands of the Tea Party movement and Democrats will lose to them by double-digits all around the country. The Tea Party organizations are the 800lb gorilla in the room. Just ask Stupak. If you are on the wrong side of that movement, there is a very good chance you will lose in November.

PS the rape kit story has been debunked. I'd link to it, but I don't have enough posts yet.

I do not believe that at all. This woman knows all aspects about what we need in America right now. Faith, Honesty, and patriotism. These aspects of American life have left us and now we can see the consequences. Sarah Palin can lead this country to the glory years once again. All we need is a REAL AMERICAN running the show.

Dang right StarSpangledPat!

This amazing country has taken a turn for the worse since we let the weaker-thans take a hold of her. I used to be somewhat hesitant of the thought of a female President, but Palin has my full support. Let's hope she comes out FULL ALASKA to bring America back to where she belongs; in the hearts and homes of all patriots.

   
 
 
Palins prospects for running for President veered into a ditch over the weekend

It is unlikely she could get elected dog catcher

Dog catcher?

No thanks!

Did you see her clubbing the shit out of those halibuts?

God only knows what that sadistic psycho bitch would do to some poor stray dog.
 
 
Palins presidential aspirations have jumped the shark

 
 
 
 
Hey... she knows a helluva lot more than Obama, who quite frankly, doesn't seem all that bright. Obama is a guy to whom reality is a quaint notion.. he lives in a world of theoreticals, hypotheticals and assorted writings of Marx and Engels and other failed pie in the sky ideas. A true dunderhead.

 

That outdated, old and tired rhetoric is what got this clown elected in the first place.

So she goes out there and spews out a lot of feel-good generalizations and you people lap it up like there's no tommorrow.

Just what the hell can any elected official do to to engender these values?

Maybe give tax credits for flying the flag or going to church?
 
 
She is all but over. Her stupid show got canceled, her book sales have tanked, and this tragedy has made her look even more foolish.

Conservatives would do well to admit they put their money on the wrong horse and move on.

So here is my question. Do you think that she is now immune fromthe viciousness of the liberal attacks in 3 years? Has she developed the antibodies? or do you think that they successfully destroyed her by being the evil vermin tha liberals are?

I do feel that she can do a great job. She did great for Alaska. She had 80% approval, took on corruption in her own party, cut spending even when there was a surplus in the Alaskan budget, lowered taxes, gave tax rebates to Alaskans., etc.

 

All her good points (and the Tea Party's) are lost if this becomes partisan competition. If there was a mixed ticket with goals of mutual cooperation and correction, people might listen instead of shutting each other out to discredit one group and credit another instead.

 

We think a lot alike. I also favor cooperation between the parties. That is what this country was FOUNDED on.
However, the discipline of mediation AND COMPROMISE is a lost one with right wing and left wing KOOKS.
 
 
She can't win because she quit on the state of Alaska. Her reasoning was because the political climate was so corrupt (I actually don't dispute this). Where she runs into trouble is this: what better position than to try clean up the corruption than as governor? I don't think there's a really good answer to this.

In debates, and during a presidential run I doubt she'd be able to escape the label of being a quitter. That's not being a strong leader whatsoever, so I don't think she'd have that leadership edge over anybody.
 
 
 
 
I liked Sarah Palin before she started trying to ride on the Tea Party wagon. I think the movement had more credibility as individual grassroots citizens based on Constitutional values, before this became fuel for onesided Republican politicking against Democrats.

I still think we need a mixed ticket. I would prefer a Conservative or Moderate Republican for President who can work with a Moderate Progressive Democrat as Vice President.

How can you claim to represent all citizens and public interests equally if parties "take turns" controlling executive or legislative branches, and then waste resources fighting instead of cooperating on Constitutional solutions everyone can freely consent to.

 
I have been pondering this.

Sarah Palin is extremely knowledgeable.

 YouTube - Palin SRLC - Part 1 

 YouTube - Sarah Palin Speech at the Southern GOP Conference 

I don't think anyone who heard her speak at the SRLC can deny that. And she did it without a teleprompter.

We know that the radical left wingers shot all their ammo at her, attacking her children, attacking her as a mom, trying to portray her as stupid, yadda, yadda, yadda. They did this because they consider her a grave threat. The question we should ask ourselves is why do they consider her such a threat?

We also know that Obama is dumber than a rock.

He is the twit that has been embracing america's enemies, and alienating america's friends.

He is the twit that wants to raise all sorts of taxes in a bad economy.

He is the twit that wants to micromanage the private sector and thinks this won't lead lead to economic collapse.

I do not believe that at all. This woman knows all aspects about what we need in America right now. Faith, Honesty, and patriotism. These aspects of American life have left us and now we can see the consequences. Sarah Palin can lead this country to the glory years once again. All we need is a REAL AMERICAN running the show.

 

So she goes out there and spews out a lot of feel-good generalizations and you people lap it up like there's no tommorrow.

Just what the hell can any elected official do to to engender these values?

Maybe give tax credits for flying the flag or going to church?

She is all but over. Her stupid show got canceled, her book sales have tanked, and this tragedy has made her look even more foolish.

Conservatives would do well to admit they put their money on the wrong horse and move on.

 

Now see, you are very misinformed. Palins show did not get cancelled. She only contracted to do 8 episodes and that was it. The episodes ended last night. They offered her to do more episodes and she declined. Quit your smear tactics on this fine patriotic woman and get your facts straight. Palin is not through. She is just getting started and she is not backing down to anybody, left or right.
 
 
 
 
 
I'll explain this to you how it works.

1.) Alaska government taxes oil companies.
2.) Alaska government takes those taxes and gives it to everyone else in the state.

Or I'll draw a picture.

Money taxed from oil companies ---> goes to ---> Alaskans.

Imagine this scenario.

1.) California government taxes Silicon Valley companies
2.) California government taxes those taxes and gives it to everyone else in the state.

If California did that, I would imagine guys like you would be starting threads about "Communism" and "Socialism" and "Marxism" and "Hitlerism" in California. But, ah, Alaska does it, and its a "tax cut."

Its amazing how the mind can rationalize things, isn't it?

 

What is so difficult to understand?

Alaska gets most of it's money in the state budget from oil companies in the form of taxes. If the oil companies are doing well, Alaska collects more revenue. If the oil companies are doing poorly, Alaska collects less revenue.

Alaska then needs to decide what to do with the revenue. Oil companies at the time that Sarah Palin was elected were doing well. Therefore, the Alaska budget had a surplus at this time.

Palin was pressured to spend the money on whatever stuff legislatures piss money away on. Instead of doing that she gave a tax rebate to the people of Alaska.

That is a good thing.

 

I think its a good thing as well. I said in an earlier post that it is generally better for the government to give it to the people than to spend it.

But understand it for what it is - it is a transference of wealth from the profits of oil companies to everybody else. If it was anything else, then the taxes for the oil companies should go lower, not taxes from the oil companies going to Alaskans. It is no different than taxing the profits of Apple or Cisco and giving it directly to everybody else. The only difference is that it is oil rather than hardware or software.

 

Actually its very different, Oil is on state owned land, Oil companies lease the land and extract oil from public land. If Apple was harvesting computers from state owned land you would have made a point.

Sad, this shows the power of hate speech, lies, and how powerful the Liberals are. The Liberals can destroy any person they want. Its simple, they have all the power of the traditional television media.

We should run Palin, she would be a great President, I see no reason other than she is a Washington D.C. outsider.

Sounds like a breath of fresh air, too bad all the hot air destroyed a good person.

Semantics.

Raising taxes and raising the lease royalties has the same economic affect.

By your logic, Hugo Chavez nationalizing the oil industry is OK if he raises lease royalties from 50% to 99.9%.
 
 
In fact, Sarah Palin is America's secret weapon. It's true!

If Sarah gets elected President, America will take over the world! They know it!

'Cause if she gets elected everyone else in every other country in the world is going to DROP DEAD FROM LAUGHING SO HARD!

Then the world will be ours!

They may, but how informed is the rest of the world. I know what some in Bulgaria say about Obama, they believe we are regressing to the state Bulgaria was in under Communist fools, the three Bulgarians I worked with all agreed. So I will take being laughed at instead of scorned for sliding closer towards Marxism.

Palin raised taxes on oil companies and used that money to give bigger checks to Alaskans. Full-stop. It doesn't matter if the land was leased or not.

That's very liberal of her.

 Will the Arizona tragedy end Palin's presidential hopes? - The Week 

The shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is being called a "turning point" and a "defining moment" for Sarah Palin, whose use of gun imagery (a 2010 campaign "map" targeting Giffords district with a crosshairs symbol and a call to "reload") has been linked, unfairly or not, to the Arizona tragedy. As soon as the media made the connection, Palin's odds to win the 2012 Republican presidential nomination started sinking sharply at Irish bookmaker InTrade. Can Palin recover, or even thrive, from this tragedy, or could it end her political ambitions forever?
 
 
Toward the end of 2010, an increasing number of conservative voices began publicly raising concerns about her viability as a '12 nominee, and a poll at the end of December found a staggering drop -- 20 points in a year -- in the number of Republicans who said they were receptive to the idea of supporting Palin for the '12 nod. Watching the struggles of Sharron Angle, Christine O'Donnell, Ken Buck and others seemed to be having an effect on the right's assessment of Palin.

And now, the news media is freely mixing in reminders of Palin's most provocative antics with its coverage of a bloody shooting rampage

If Palin truly has Presidential aspirations, she needs to take this opportunity to show she is "Presidential". Playing the victim is not becoming of a future president.

She used improper sybology with her crosshairs and "Don't Retreat...RELOAD" rhetoric. Sarah needs to "man-up" and accept personal responsibility. She needs to say "I regret the imagery that was used and the possible affect it had on the Giffords family".

Sending cryptic emails to Glenn Beck about how everyone is picking on you is not presidential

LOL, you giving Palin "advice" on how she should ACT, is a fxxking laugh riot.
I could tell you to "act" like a decent being, but it wouldn't make a damn difference.
 
 
Palin needs to man up and appear on mainstream media and show some contrition. Playing the victim here while Giffords lapses in and out of a coma is not Presidential.

Palin needs to admit that her imagery was not intended to provoke violence but may have been considered innapropriate. She also needs to vow to turn down her rhetoric in the future

Hiding from the media and playing the victim will end her future presidential chances....if she ever had any

Sending cryptic emails to Glenn Beck about how everyone is picking on you is not presidential

 

It's called "strategery"...
 
 
 
 
In fact, Sarah Palin is America's secret weapon. It's true!

If Sarah gets elected President, America will take over the world! They know it!

'Cause if she gets elected everyone else in every other country in the world is going to DROP DEAD FROM LAUGHING SO HARD!

Then the world will be ours!

 

They may, but how informed is the rest of the world. I know what some in Bulgaria say about Obama, they believe we are regressing to the state Bulgaria was in under Communist fools, the three Bulgarians I worked with all agreed. So I will take being laughed at instead of scorned for sliding closer towards Marxism.

 

See if they are supporters of Monarchy or the Arrow Cross factions. If they are, they would think anyone beyond Joe Scarborough is a flaming communist.
 
 
The victim here is Giffords and the other casualties, not Sarah in any way shape form or fashion.

Oh really, Palin DIDN'T ASK to get drugged into this bY a bunch of idiots with a AGENDA.
but here she is.
 
 
Her group posted that stupid image, and, yes, she is responsible for whatever the group does in her name.

The question is not whether the inference you resent is fair, Stephanie, but how much said inference can be repaired. Among non-right wingers I don't think it can.

Her campaign is over before it got started.
 
 
In light of the recent tragedy in Az wouldn't it be prudent to lay off Sarah Palin for a while instead of trolling for hate-speech?

However.....it looks like Palin supported everything that was posted under her name

Fuck No!
 
 
My party is Republican, Stephanie, and from the get go on this Board I have been quite clear I don't want Palin winning its nomination next year. My desire is not that of a lapdog but one of desire for a GOP candidate who can run and win.
 
 
great

Sarah needs to be knocked down so hard politically that all she will want to do is make her $$$ as a makefunof personality, not a politician.

Actually I think the only thing that needs to be knocked down is the lefts UNHEALTHY FIXATION with republican women.
 
 
 
I'm with AmwayMike on this one

Palin would make a wonderful Republican candidate for President

Run Sarah........RUN

 

Pray you don't get what you ask for, dipstick.

Palin represents the best the GOP has to offer. She, and she alone has the values, experience and intelligence to represent her party

Your thinker don't work no good, gramps. When compared to GOP fixation to Mrs. Clinton, your statement is simply... stupid. You must be a very unhealthy, fixated far right thinker.
 
 
She is not running.
Quitters never win and winners never quit.
Book it. I have nothing against the woman.
I give her credit for knowing she doesn't stand a chance and will not enter the race as a result of that.
 
 
 
I have been pondering this.

Sarah Palin is extremely knowledgeable.

 YouTube - Palin SRLC - Part 1 

 YouTube - Sarah Palin Speech at the Southern GOP Conference 

I don't think anyone who heard her speak at the SRLC can deny that. And she did it without a teleprompter.

We know that the radical left wingers shot all their ammo at her, attacking her children, attacking her as a mom, trying to portray her as stupid, yadda, yadda, yadda. They did this because they consider her a grave threat. The question we should ask ourselves is why do they consider her such a threat?

We also know that Obama is dumber than a rock.

He is the twit that has been embracing america's enemies, and alienating america's friends.

He is the twit that wants to raise all sorts of taxes in a bad economy.

He is the twit that wants to micromanage the private sector and thinks this won't lead lead to economic collapse.

So here is my question. Do you think that she is now immune fromthe viciousness of the liberal attacks in 3 years? Has she developed the antibodies? or do you think that they successfully destroyed her by being the evil vermin tha liberals are?

I do feel that she can do a great job. She did great for Alaska. She had 80% approval, took on corruption in her own party, cut spending even when there was a surplus in the Alaskan budget, lowered taxes, gave tax rebates to Alaskans., etc.

 

Obama recently polled as more popular than former Gov Sarah Palin in ALASKA, of all places.

I ask you, who knows her better than the people of her own state?

Palin is, at her very core a Political Whore. She will not run, she loves her FixedLies money way more than having to work for a living.
