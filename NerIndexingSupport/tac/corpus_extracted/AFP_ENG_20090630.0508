Japan on Tuesday welcomed the withdrawal of US troops from Iraqi cities and
towns and pledged further aid and loans to help rebuild the country.

Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone in a statement called the troop pullout six
years after the US-led invasion "a significant step forward for Iraq to be self-
reliant, ensuring its own security."

"The government of Japan welcomes the completion of withdrawing the US combat
troops from urban areas of the Republic of Iraq by the deadline, June 30, in
accordance with the agreement between the two countries," he said.

He added: "The security situation in Iraq has seen overall improvement, however
sporadic terrorist attacks continue, and Japan strongly hopes that Iraq achieves
further consolidation of stability."

Nakasone pledged that Japan would continue "making efforts for reconstruction of
Iraq through yen loans and technical assistance."

Iraq declared a national holiday Tuesday to mark the pullback, part of a
landmark security agreement signed in November between Baghdad and Washington,
ahead of a complete US withdrawal from Iraq by the end of 2011.
