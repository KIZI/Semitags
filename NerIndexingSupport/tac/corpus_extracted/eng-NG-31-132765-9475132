Bulls Country and University Community

Over the past two years I have worked with many of you to improve the area
of the University Community through many projects and endeavours and to
connect the USF community with the surrounding community.  I would like to
announce my candidacy for Vice-President of the Student Body of USF.
Student Government at USF is a very influential body at the university with
an annual budget of 10 million dollars and growing and voting positions on
many of the voting and governing boards of the university, including the
Board of Trustees.  As Vice-President, I will commit myself to the same
goals as I mentioned before, but armed with the resources of Student
Government, I can realize this vision even further.  As Vice-President of
Student Government I will advocate for the following:

Increased Student Government networking events amongst Bulls Country
businesses, student organizations, and University Departments.

Advocate for a late night shuttle on Fowler AVE that shall allow students
and other members of the USF community to access BULLS COUNTRY night life
attractions in the area.

A dedicated Community and Local Business Resource Coordinator of Student
Government that shall work closely with local business and community leaders
to ensure a unified goal and growth of the University Community.

If yourself or any of your contacts would be able to offered financial or
physical support to the campaign please let me know and reply to this
email.  Thank you and all of your support is greatly appreciated.
