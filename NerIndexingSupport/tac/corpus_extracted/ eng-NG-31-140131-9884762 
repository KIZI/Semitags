The Miami Dolphins will be without star linebacker Zach Thomas for
Sunday¹s game against the Buffalo Bills.

Thomas was ruled out today after experiencing more migraine headaches.
Thomas had practiced fully Thursday and was optimistic about facing the
Bills.

Thomas was diagnosed with whiplash after the car he was driving was
rear-ended on the Florida Turnpike after Miami¹s Oct. 21 game against
New England.
