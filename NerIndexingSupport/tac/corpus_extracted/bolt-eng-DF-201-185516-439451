Whatever happened to that paranoic theory?
 
 
it went the way of sylvia browns prediction that clinton would be reelected to a 3rd term in 2000
 
 
His most recent movies finally came to cable and everyone realized how unelectable he would be outside of the crappy state responsible for them.  
 
 
It went the same place that predictions of the Y2K apocalypse, a Bush dictatorship, and most recently all manner of horrible things on 8/8/08: down the memory hole, never to be spoken of again lest the woo have to admit it was wrong.

Hey, we might self centered, spoiled, naive, wimpy neo-liberals but...................oh.

Agreed. NorCal rocks!  
 
 
Do these idiots even have a clue what they’re talking about?

Seriously… two consecutive term limit, anybody? President has to be a BORN American?

Oh, forget what I’m saying. I’m just a silly Canadian who doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

its not just 2 consecutive terms, its 2 terms period.

sylvia brown said they were goign to change the law to allow it (which i think would be a constitutional amendment)

but no, im sure most dont have a clue what they are talking about (or at the very least dont think before speaking) in the case of brown she probably said the incumbant would be re-elected because in many cases thats a safe bet, without realizing he was in his second term already

Exactly right. The requirement that the President be a natural-born citizen is in Article II Section 1 of the Constitution:

 
No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President;

 
The two-term limit was enacted by an amendment to the Constitution, Amendment XXII, in 1951.

To remove either of these could only be done with another amendment, a process which was designed to be difficult. Amendments aimed at repealing Presidential term limits and at permitting naturalized citizens to be President were introduced in Congress in 2005 and 2004, but they never made it out of Congress.
 
 
The only conspiracy theories I heard about Arnold came from the LaRouche crowd.

Don't ask me for details, because they weren't coherent enough to remember. Hjalmar Schacht was probably involved somehow.
 
 
McCain is Schwarzenegger in disguise.. Just like those lizardpeople. Just wait and see..

Someone will no doubt claim that the reason it never happened because they cottoned on to it in time and exposed it so then the NWO wouldn't dare do it any more. The world has been saved by a fruitloop yet again.
 
 
Actually, IIRC, the film "Demolition Man" mentioned "President Schwarzennegger". When Character One called the other Character on this impossibility, the other Character did mention an amendment to the Constitution.
 
 
I recall one conspiraloon on Myspace Forums about a year ago or so, claiming with absolute certainty that "Hillary Klinton" [sic] was going to be the next President, and calling everyone who didn't believe him "brainwashed sheeple" or something to that effect.

I thought that was rather prescient, given that he subsequently became a governor!  
 
 
 
"Hillary Klinton" [sic]

 
Anyone remember Kang and Kodos from the Simpsons?

"I am Clin-ton..."

From what I've heard, Arnold may not make it to the RNC due to California's budget not being passed yet.
