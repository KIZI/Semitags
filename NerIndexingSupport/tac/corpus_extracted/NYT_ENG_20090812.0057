Robert Pattinson -- he of the wild, teased mane -- may stand alone
in this summer's teenage-adulation market: Us Weekly published its
first-ever "bookazine" about him and his "Twilight" co-stars, a
decision Janice Min, then the editor, chalked up to a "hunk
recession."

His hair, however, has plenty of competition. There is a minor
eruption of major hair atop the country's young male populace --
and, as hair is wont to do, it's growing.

Curiously, the look is not one of style as much as degree. There
is no army of winsomely tousled RPattz clones. Instead, there are
Afros, mohawks, dreadlocks and pompadours. There are "Idol"-ized
punky pincushions, Allman-esque hippie cascades (with matching
beards) and Bowie-style, parti-colored shags. And these are just
the styles that have names. Often enough, these clever young
dandies are crossbreeding styles into hybrids unknown to the Rock
'n' Roll Hair Hall of Fame.

As one might expect, they are proud of the fact.

Victor Jeffreys II, who has a giant Afro, refers proudly to what
he calls his "non-normative hair." Cameron Cooper, a fashion
stylist, refers to his creatively shaved skull as "the exclamation
point at the end of my sentence."

These men are what Malcolm Gladwell might call hair outliers
(and his own Afro would get him right into the club). Still,
spotting them is not hard. Just nip into an edgy salon like Woodley
& Bunny in Williamsburg, or run some fatally hip gantlet like the
summertime Warm Up parties at P.S.1 in Queens or openings at 3rd
Ward in Bushwick, and you are all but sure to run headlong into an
expressive excrescence or two.

"All of a sudden, a big wave of guys just want to experiment,"
said Marguerite Jukes, a stylist at the Bumble and bumble salon in
the meatpacking district, where the shagadelic manes of the
Broadway cast of "Hair" are faithfully kept up. "No one just
wants a trim anymore. There isn't one particular look: It's a
little bit of everything." She has even become an expert at
getting the look not quite perfect, "so it looks like they cut it
themselves in their bathroom."

Often guys who are after a more extreme look will drop the name
of some rocker -- Robert Plant, Simon Le Bon, Robert Smith, Anthony
Kiedis -- as inspiration. But what makes this curious trend even
curiouser is how little connection the hair actually has to the
moment, the man or the music that spawned it. That guy with the
long, brown hair and beard may well have techno on his iPod, and
the guy with the dyed blue shag is as likely to be drumming his
fingers in time to death metal.

"You can never tell what they're into from their hair," Jukes
said. She pointed out that her boyfriend, Ben Koller of the
metalcore band Converge, has gone for the early-1970s look of the
teenage John Michael Osbourne (back when he was the lead singer of
Black Sabbath). His band, however, favors a chaotic clash of punk
and metal that makes Black Sabbath's 1970 hit "Paranoid" sound
like Doris Day. And however you thought Adam Lambert's hairstyle
pegged him, it was clear to "American Idol" audiences that
musically, at least, the man's got range.

Once upon a time -- say, 40 years ago this week, when long-hairs
thronged to Woodstock by the hundreds of thousands -- you got a
hairstyle to show the world your affiliation, to brandish a
cultural identity defined by your musical tastes, your political
views or how depressed you were. But such literal interpretations
of hair appear to be utterly passe, even if the hairstyles
themselves are not.

"I don't think it defines people at all anymore," said James
Carpinello, who, six nights a week, dons a long blond wig and
skintight white leather pants to play the fictional 1980s rocker
Stacee Jaxx in Broadway's hilarious hair-metal musical "Rock of
Ages." Practicing for the role never felt quite right, he said,
until the day he got to put on "the hair." (He never calls it a
wig.)

"I needed something, and it was the hair," he said, chuckling.
"It makes everything come together."

And now that "the hair" covers up his own, he has been
inspired to let his own grow. He slicked it into a 1930s style for
the Tony Awards, but that was only the beginning. "I've got this
thick pomade," he said, "and I used that and kind of pulled my
hair out so I looked like I'd stuck my finger in a socket. On the
train people were looking at me like I was out of my mind, but I
thought it was hysterical. Now I want to grow it out so I can have
a ponytail."

Even though he swings a blond wig around for work, Carpinello
may represent the more average guy, simply experimenting rather
than going for an out-there style that, should an in-law or a job
interview pop up, would call for a hat. Fashionable hair-care
companies like Kiehl's, Shu Uemura and Bumble and bumble report
that sales of the more extreme products -- strong gels, pomades,
pastes and waxes -- are up sharply of late, with male customers
accounting for much of the increase. But what comes out of the
bathroom is anyone's guess.

"Back in the 1960s, the only important thing was length," said
Michael McDonald, the costume (and hair) designer for the "Hair"
Broadway revival. "It wasn't until the 1970s, and the disco era,
that men's hair started to really have 'style.' And then every
moment had its look, so that now, in the 21st century, we've pretty
much seen everything wacky you can do to your hair. It's all there
to go back to and interpret."

McDonald can generally spot the inspirations. "There's a little
bit of everything," he said. "Maybe it's a little Flock of
Seagulls, maybe a little Backstreet Boys." But there the trail
goes dead. If the hair is goth, the clothes might be
skater-cum-prep, and the shoes rockabilly. "It's all mixed up so
beautifully," he said. "It's really neat the way they can just
cut and paste."

It may be jarring to casual onlookers -- those of us accustomed
to thinking that hippie hair goes with pacifism and the Grateful
Dead, while mohawks go with "Anarchy in the U.K." -- but the guys
who are taking the do but leaving its roots have no more qualms
about it than a DJ who samples from other songs.

"I know I'm not a trailblazer," said Cooper, the fashion
stylist. "To me, it's just personal. It's a creative outlet."

And for some, having statement hair can be a way to avoid being
pigeonholed. Jeffreys, who works as a hedge fund analyst and
moonlights as a fine arts photographer, has had his Afro for
several years, through college and various undergraduate jobs,
because, first and foremost, it is easy to maintain -- just an
occasional brushing.

"But it would be a lie to say I didn't like the way it looks,"
he said. Having been a cultural anthropology major at Duke who
spent time in Ghana, he has long noticed how hair works as a kind
of ID.

"Hair really links you to community, whether you're a punk
rocker or a woman who braids her hair a certain way because she's
from Klikor," he said. As the son of a Costa Rican mother and a
white American father, Jeffreys grew up keenly aware of the tiny
visual cues people search for in determining approximately who a
person is. His Afro, he said, kind of shorts out the process.

"Those things that our culture puts a lot of value on -- gender,
race, sexuality, socio-economic class -- I've had to mediate them
all to get anything done in my life, so I've tried not to get
fixated on any of them."

For a generation that is, courtesy of the Internet, both
disconnected from and connected to the past like no other before
it, it makes sense that this point-and-click, cut-and-paste
attitude should be present even in the one arena of style in which
virtually every man grows his own.

So what if you find yourself wondering: Who is that guy? What's
the deal with that hair? What does it all mean? To turn an old ad
slogan on its head: Not even his hairdresser knows for sure.
