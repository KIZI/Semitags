Basic facts about the Arab Republic of Egypt which is holding a parliamentary
election on Sunday.

GEOGRAPHY: The Arab republic of Egypt is located on Africa's northeast corner,
with the Sinai peninsula bridging over into Asia. Egypt borders Libya to the
west, Sudan to the south, and Israel and the Gaza Strip to the east.

AREA: 997,738 square kilometres (385,228 square miles).

POPULATION: With about 83 million residents according to the World Bank, Egypt
is the Arab world's most populous country.

CAPITAL: Cairo.

RELIGION: Most Egyptians are Sunni Muslim. Islam is the state religion. Coptic
Christians make up six to 10 percent of the population.

HISTORY: After a period of British rule, Egypt gained independence in 1922 under
the reign of King Fuad I.

In 1952, Gamal Abdel Nasser overthrew the king and a republic was declared on
June 18, 1953 headed by Mohamed Naguib. Nasser became president in 1956, the
same year the Suez Canal was nationalised.

After Nasser's death in 1970, his vice president Anwar Sadat took over as
president. Sadat became the first Arab head of state to sign a peace treaty with
Israel (1979). He was assassinated two years later by Islamists.

Current president Hosni Mubarak has been in power since 1981.

POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS: A presidential system, with the president serving
unlimited six-year terms.

In May 2005, constitutional reforms led to the first ever multi-party elections.
Four months later Mubarak was re-elected for a fifth term.

Egypt has a bicameral legislature overwhelmingly dominated by the ruling
National Democratic Party (NDP).

The People's Assembly (Magles al-Shaab), which currently has 444 elected members
and 10 appointed by the president, is responsible for passing laws and
supervising the government.

In Sunday's election, 508 seats are being contested, after a new law was passed
last year that reserved 64 seats for women MPs.

Members are elected every five years in popular ballots rights groups say are
consistently marked by fraud and intimidation in favour of government
candidates.

The Muslim Brotherhood is the largest opposition force, with one fifth of
parliament made up of its members sitting as independents since religious
parties are banned in Egypt.
