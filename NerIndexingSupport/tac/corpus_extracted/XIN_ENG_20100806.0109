The Ghanaian ruling party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), extended its
warm felicitation on Friday to the largest opposition, the New Patriotic Party
(NPP), which will go to the polls on Saturday to elect a flag bearer to lead the
party in the national election in 2012.

A statement issued here by NDC communications director James Asante urged the
NPP to demonstrate its ability to maintain internal cohesion required to promote
multi-party democracy in the West African country.

"The election should be contested on the terrain of tolerance and freedom so
that whoever emerges as winner would be seen as a credible choice to underscore
the essence of a viable opposition needed in the 2012 elections," it said.

It advised the NPP that they should return from their flag bearer selection
contest with a sincere attitude to adhere to the rules of fair and healthy
democratic competition.

"We hope they do not come out of this exercise more fractious than they
currently are since a weak opposition does not serve the interest of Ghana and
the NDC."

The ruling party in Ghana promised as ever to adhere to the rules of decent
campaigning towards the 2012 elections.

Five contestants are vying for the NPP presidential slot in the ground-breaking
elections to be supervised by the national electoral commission on Saturday.

NDC came to power after the national elections towards the end of 2008 while the
NPP ruled the West African country from 2001- 2009.
