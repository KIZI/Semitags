Deep US voter anger at Washington propelled insurgent "Tea Party" darling Rand
Paul to victory Tuesday in Kentucky's Republican Senate primary over a hand-
picked establishment candidate.

Paul, an eye doctor and conservative activist, routed Trey Grayson, Kentucky's
secretary of state and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's
anointed favorite.

"Tonight is a great victory, and I thank you all," Paul told cheering
supporters.

"I have a message, a message from the Tea Party, a message that is loud and
clear and does not mince words: We have come to take our government back."

Paul's easy victory ranked among the sweetest triumphs of the "Tea Party"
movement, angry that Republicans in Washington have not more successfully
blocked President Barack Obama's agenda.

"Washington is horribly broken," said Paul. "We are encountering a day of
reckoning, and this movement, this Tea Party movement is a message to Washington
that we're unhappy and that we want things done differently."

Paul -- the son of Texas Representative Ron Paul, a maverick Republican
candidate for president in 2008 -- will face Democratic state attorney general
Jack Conway for the seat held by retiring Republican Senator Jim Bunning.

Some analysts have warned that the "Tea Party" could split Republican supporters
or alienate swing-voters in hard-fought races to be decided in November
elections, costing Obama's critics potential victories.

With almost all official results recorded, Paul had an insurmountable 59 percent
to 35 percent edge over Grayson.

In his victory speech, Paul sharply assailed Obama for attending global climate
change talks in Copenhagen, and accused him of siding with leaders like
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and Bolivia's Evo
Morales in blaming capitalism for global warming.

"The president, by attending Copenhagen, gave credibility and credence to these
folks," charged Paul, who said Obama should not have joined the more than 120
heads of state in attending the summit. "America's a great country."

Obama did not side with Chavez, Morales and Mugabe, who bitterly criticized him
at the summit, and has called instead for a market-based approach to tackling
climate change.
