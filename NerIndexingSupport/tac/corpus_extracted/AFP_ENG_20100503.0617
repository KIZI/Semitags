Gary Mott steers his boat past four oil skimmers forced to anchor in the
Mississippi River by rough seas and wonders how many more fish he'll be able to
snare before a massive slick reaches shore.

"There's no oil here yet - no oil that we've seen," he said. "But we all feel
that if it ever got in this interior marsh it would be very, very difficult to
clean up."

Like many residents of this costal town, Mott takes his motor boat into the
marshes which fan out from the mouth of the Mississippi to catch a few fish for
dinner.

He often forgets just how beautiful the bird-filled marshes are. But today, he
realized he could lose it all to a sea of crude gushing up from an offshore well
at a rate of 200,000 gallons a day.

"It's going to be bad," he says as he steers the boat across the shallow marsh
towards his fishing line where five fat redfish were waiting for him.

"This is one big huge maze," he explains. "They would be literally like rats in
a maze running around trying to get it cleaned up if the oil got into this
interior marsh."

Nobody knows when the oil will stop gushing from a deep-water well cracked open
after an offshore oil platform run by British energy giant BP sank on April 22,
two days after a massive explosion that killed 11 workers.

Rough seas and high winds have hampered efforts to contain the spill - which has
spread across a huge swath of the Gulf of Mexico - and skim it off the surface
before it reaches the fragile coast.

Mott is hoping that the strong currents from the Mississippi will keep the oil
from leeching up river until it is either collected from the sea or gets carried
to less sensitive coastal areas.

"If we could get some help from Mother Nature - if we could get this weather to
lay down - it would be much easier," he told AFP.

Environmentalists say it could take decades for the fragile marshes -- more than
40 percent of America's wetlands -- to recover if waves simply wash the oil over
miles of boom set up to protect the coast.

Louisiana's 2.4-billion-dollar a year commercial and recreational fishing
industry was dealt its first major blow Sunday when the US government banned
activities in some areas for at least 10 days due to health concerns.

Dozens of anxious fishermen lined up outside a high school in the coastal town
of Venice waiting for a chance to get trained to work on the cleanup.

"We're trying to get some work, but too many people are looking for work," said
John Chiem, 51, as he sat on a bench in the shade with two other Vietnamese
shrimpers.

"I might be homeless. There are too many bills and the bank could take my
house."

Hundreds have already attended the briefing sessions in hopes of netting work
laying out protective booms or mopping up oil-soaked wetlands.

The oil spill couldn't have come at a worse time for Louisiana, which is still
recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and decades of
coastal erosion.

Chiem's boat was badly damaged in the storm and it was six months before he
could get it back in the water.

Shrimping is not an easy life, he said. Most shrimpers head out in crews of
three or four people and spend a week to ten days at sea.

The waters can be rough, and so is the work, as they drag their nets through the
rich waters fed by the mouth of the Mississippi River.

Chiem tried going out last week when officials opened shrimping season early to
give the fishermen a chance to catch what they could.

But the seas were rough. The weather was bad. And Chiem came back with empty
nets.
