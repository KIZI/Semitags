 Think Progress » Census worker hanged with the word âfedâ scrawled on his body. 

 
The AP is reporting that Bill Sparkman, a 51-year-old part-time Census field worker and occasional teacher, was found hung to death in Kentucky with the word fed was scrawled on the dead mans chest. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive, but law enforcement officers have told the agency the matter is an apparent homicide. Our job is to determine if there was foul play involved  and thats part of the investigation  and if there was foul play involved, whether that is related to his employment as a census worker, said FBI spokesman David Beyer.

 

Great, so one of the nutjobs who is all about watering the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants finally went and killed someone?

I'm sure Michelle Bachmann will be pleased.
 
 
but they aren't inciting anyone or anything like that.....

that's just goofy. right?

Anyone here really surprised?

Of course, calling these people Anti-American and trying to help advance the Socialist Agenda isn't going to incite anyone or provoke anyone.

What the idiots who have those signs and slogans fail to realize is that the tree of liberty is never happy, you can continue the bloodlust all you want but it will never be quenched.
 
 
I'll wait for the facts to come in but it does look like the rabble rousing voices of the right might have their first bit of blood on their hands.
 
 
Michelle Bachmann is probably ROFLing and LOLing.
 
 
its Kentucky, they likely were moonshiners
 
 
hey, but way to turn this into a political motive with ZERO proof
 
 
 
 
I,ll wait for the facts to come in but it does look like the rabble rousing voices of the right might have their first bit of blood on their hands.

 

There probably wasn't much blood since it was a hanging.

Unless the word "fed" was carved onto his chest.

And again, if the carving was postmortem, there wouldn't be a lot of blood either.
 
 
I HOPE this is not what it looks like.

it was the proverbial "blood" as in this mans death.

You make a good point.

Maybe he was gay, but very ashamed, and he killed himself because he knew that he could never have a relationship with his co-worker - Fred.

So he wrote his true love's name over his heart...but unfortunately misspelled it.

It's probably a suicide, just like Vince Foster.

and if the people that did it were moonshiners, and they thought he was a "fed" aka "revenuer"

how would that be "political"

this did happen in Kentucky, remember?
 
 
 
I'll wait for the facts to come in but it does look like the rabble rousing voices of the right might have their first bit of blood on their hands.

 

yeah, SURE you will
 
 
 
 
its Kentucky, they likely were moonshiners

 

Because a CENSUS worker is going to have FED what is likely carved onto his body?

After all this rousing about the Census and how it's corrupt, how Obama's going to use it to turn the country Socialist, and you would be surprised by the fact that someone actually went and killed a Census worker for that same reason?

like i said," points to" it could be anything at this point, but i would say if moonshiners killed him and wrote fed it would still be a kind of political killing just from a different area.

Enough of the bickering! After all...a man is dead!

Let's put our difference aside and send our condolences to his wife, Maggie Sue, and his kids Billy Joe, Jim-Bob, and the twins, Dale and Dwayne.
 
 
Alright, so it says scrawled and not carved, my mistake. However, there is still a dead Census worker with the word fed scrawled on his body.

Any theories over there? Other then the fact it's the moonshiners supposedly?

that's just goofy. right?  

 

As a matter of fact, it's idiotic to think there is inciting. Unless you want to start burning books and music albums/discs. Start with The Catcher in the Rye and Double White/Helter Skelter.

islamofascists who got chased away before finishing scrawling "fedayeen" on him.
 
 
I'm sure there's less to this story then meets the eye.

It went through the "Hysterical Librul Magnifying Glass" so you first have to say, "Did this really happen?" then "Did this happen the way it was reported?"

If it did happen as reported, however unlikely, then its a cautionary tale that we won't go gracefully into the Good Night of Socialism

Oh really? So all these people carrying signs saying that the blood of tyrants must be spilled to water the tree of liberty wouldn't shoot Obama if given the opportunity?

If you actually are that naive, you are pathetic.

Nice pathetic deflection. Going to answer my question there bucko?

Here's the thing. After the months of this spill the blood bullshit, you'd actually be surprised that one of the nutjobs actually went ahead and went through with it?  
 
 
It's possible that it's because he was a teacher. Some political parties are not very fond of education these days.

Actually no, I made my opinion that a nutjob who believes in this "spill the blood" bullshit probably did this.

Nothing partisan about that. UNLESS you're saying that all of the nutjobs are Republicans.  
 
 
Sounds like a mob killing to me.

The only inciting I see is going on in this thread. Whacked out lefties who drool whenever someone dies mysteriously so they can accuse the right of "inciting" it. What a laugh.

No, all those persons carrying signs would not off the POTUS given the chance, you fear-mongering dolt.

Funny, I never thought that these idiots would have taken out the last POTUS, but I'm not prone to panty-wetting, dolthood, panic either. I have a spine.

 

 

 

How ridiculous your panic is.

Indeed. And many parts of West Virginia. TVA mistrust, prohibition, mining/unions, etc. I have to wonder if folks even get to know their own country at all.

For someone saying all the facts haven't come in, you seem to have already made up your mind.
 
 
For those who obviously don't know about the history of the area, here's a start:

 
....

But late in the 19th century, mining, logging and railroad companies moved into the area, often uprooting families and devastating the land.

"They took the people off the land and transferred ownership to owners outside the region who raped the land," says Curtis Wood, a professor of history at Western Carolina and co-author of "From Ulster to Carolina: The Migration of the Scotch-Irish to Southwestern North Carolina." "Rivers were damaged, land wouldn't hold water and forest fires were incredible -- epic forest fires. All this is well-documented."

When the commercial interests had extracted what they could from the area, says Wood, "they pulled out, and the people they left behind were jobless."

In 1911, Congress passed the Weeks Act authorizing the U.S. government to purchase land and create national forests. Millions of acres were acquired and eventually entrusted to the U.S. Forest and Park services and, Wood notes, putting the land out of the reach of local people.

In the 1930s, the Tennessee Valley Authority was created to control floods, improve navigation and provide electrical power in the Southeast. While credited with improving conditions in the area -- including the elimination of malaria -- Wood points out that the TVA also forced many people off their land and flooded entire towns.

"There are very few regions where white people have been forcibly removed from their lands as they have been in southern Appalachia," he says. "The attitudes of Southern mountain people toward the government have been shaped by their experiences.... They've seen their land taken out of their control and put into big programs, leaving them with diminished resources and not much in return."

Government initiatives aimed at dealing with the poverty in the region have often been at "at cross-purposes," he says, and were managed by Washington bureaucracies. "They were never guided by people in the region, and the attitudes of Southern mountain people have been shaped by this, seeing their land taken out of their control and given to big programs."

Another touchy subject, he says, is taxes. Although the federal government is by far the biggest landowner in many western North Carolina counties, it pays no county taxes. It does pay the counties a fee, but it is well below what the land would bring on the open market.

A culture of distrust for government

One of the region's best known industries was the fruit of Appalachian ingenuity and an expression of the contempt some felt for the government.

Today, the streets of downtown Andrews are quiet, and many storefronts lie vacant as merchants move to a stretch of strip malls near the main highway.

"Do you remember what they used to do in these mountains in the '20s and '30s?" area resident David Luther told USA Today. "Moonshine. Who do you think it was that used to lock up our grandfathers for making moonshine?"

The result, says Brown, is a culture thoroughly prepared to distrust the government. "One of the worst things you could hear around here," she says, "was a knock on the door and someone saying, 'I'm from Raleigh, and I'm here to help you.' "

Alright, so it says scrawled and not carved, my mistake. However, there is still a dead Census worker with the word fed scrawled on his body.

Any theories over there? Other then the fact it's the moonshiners supposedly?

 

Plenty, meth lab, pot grower, illegal tobacco field, unlicensed chinchilla ranch, hell, it could have been just about anything.

Robert, you're getting to be as bad as CNN...I might have to start calling you Nancy.

Seriously though, I think to assume that it was some illegal growers of anything were the killers doesn't make much sense. Why would they kill a Census worker and draw heat to the area? They may be stupid some of them but not that stupid.

Some may not be too educated or too bright, but they have a very tight community. Few will talk and/or rat in that sort of environment. And the criminals know they can count on that.

wow, and bobby brings yet another Palin LIE
 
 
 
Some may not be too educated or too bright, but they have a very tight community. Few will talk and/or rat in that sort of environment. And the criminals know they can count on that.

 

It doesn't matter whether the people will rat or not. That area will now be under a lot more police watchful eyes for a good amount of time.

 Think Progress » Census worker hanged with the word âfedâ scrawled on his body. 

 
The AP is reporting that Bill Sparkman, a 51-year-old part-time Census field worker and occasional teacher, was found hung to death in Kentucky with the word fed was scrawled on the dead mans chest. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive, but law enforcement officers have told the agency the matter is an apparent homicide. Our job is to determine if there was foul play involved  and thats part of the investigation  and if there was foul play involved, whether that is related to his employment as a census worker, said FBI spokesman David Beyer.

 

Great, so one of the nutjobs who is all about watering the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants finally went and killed someone?

The AP is reporting that Bill Sparkman, a 51-year-old part-time Census field worker and occasional teacher, was found hung to death in Kentucky with the word “fed” was scrawled on the dead man’s chest. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive, but “law enforcement officers have told the agency the matter is ‘an apparent homicide.’” “Our job is to determine if there was foul play involved — and that’s part of the investigation — and if there was foul play involved, whether that is related to his employment as a census worker,” said FBI spokesman David Beyer.

Once again, according to the official notices by US Gov't, Census begins with Jan 10.

 

The census conducts ongoing work throughout other times of the year, not all for the decennial census.

"He worked part-time for the Census, usually conducting interviews once or twice a month.Sparkman has worked for the Census since 2003, spanning five counties in the surrounding area. Much of his recent work had been in Clay County, officials said.
Door-to-door operations have been suspended in Clay County pending a resolution of the investigation, Scurry-Johnson said."

From the above link:

"...Gilbert Acciardo, a retired Kentucky state trooper who directs an after-school program at the elementary school where Sparkman was a frequent substitute teacher, said he had warned Sparkman to be careful when he did his Census work."I told him on more than one occasion, based on my years in the state police, 'Mr. Sparkman, when you go into those counties, be careful because people are going to perceive you different than they do elsewhere,'" Acciardo said.
"Even though he was with the Census Bureau, sometimes people can view someone with any government agency as 'the government.' I just was afraid that he might meet the wrong character along the way up there," Acciardo said.
Acciardo said he became suspicious when Sparkman didn't show up for work at the after-school program for two days and went to police. Authorities immediately initiated an investigation, he said.
"He was such an innocent person," Acciardo said. "I hate to say that he was naive, but he saw the world as all good, and there's a lot of bad in the world."
Lucindia Scurry-Johnson, assistant director of the Census Bureau's southern office in Charlotte, N.C., said law enforcement officers have told the agency the matter is "an apparent homicide" but nothing else.

Are you referring to Southie today or back when Bulger ran things? Because there were certainly rats during Whitey's day, they were just taken care of. Just wondering  

Also, yes, it is a high crime area. However, the arrival of MORE FBI and more police is not going to help things. I assume you can agree with that common sense statement?

I read the article...

The Retired State Trooper warned sparks about the mountain folk, base on "his years of service" working that area.

 
Gilbert Acciardo, a retired Kentucky state trooper who directs an after-school program at the elementary school where Sparkman was a frequent substitute teacher, said he had warned Sparkman to be careful when he did his Census work.

"I told him on more than one occasion, based on my years in the state police, 'Mr. Sparkman, when you go into those counties, be careful because people are going to perceive you different than they do elsewhere,'" Acciardo said.

"Even though he was with the Census Bureau, sometimes people can view someone with any government agency as 'the government.' I just was afraid that he might meet the wrong character along the way up there," Acciardo said.

 

Obviously (I seem to be using that word a lot lately) this distrust long predates the Obama Administration...so there's that hypothesis up in smoke.

Now, allow me to give you an analogy you lily-white city-slickers can absorb without too much background information on the hill folk culture.

Sending an uninitiated, non-local, naive, unknown census worker into the backwood of Kentucky, or Arkansas or Missouri, or Tennessee is the equivalent of ---

Sending an uninitiated, non-local, naive, unknown census worker into Cabrini Green Housing Project in Chicago, or Compton, California or Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, or the worst neighborhoods of the Five Boroughs in New York.

Remember the Mayor of Chicago moved into Cabrini-Green back in the 80's, vowing to clean it up...even with a contingent of bodyguards and police...she only lasted three weeks.

In some areas of the backwoods, it's the same philosophy, just different topography.

Great point.

I'd wager that the reason most libs don't or won't get it is because they don't live in those places either in the city or the country. It's easy to have high ideals when they're never tested.
 
 
 
 
i never said it "was" i said it "could be"
we dont know since we dont have the FACTS yet

 

We don't have all the facts yet, we got a good number however. I'm just saying, if it turned out to be a nutjob, would you be surprised?

 

 
Oh really? So all these people carrying signs saying that the blood of tyrants must be spilled to water the tree of liberty wouldn't shoot Obama if given the opportunity?

If you actually are that naive, you are pathetic.

 

Jefferson was a nutjob, right?

"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."

Seriously though, I think to assume that it was some illegal growers of anything were the killers doesn't make much sense. Why would they kill a Census worker and draw heat to the area? They may be stupid some of them but not that stupid.

 

My young friend, the reason you find it hard to believe is because you haven't seen.

You stumble on a meth lab out here, those guys will kill you and never lose a minute of sleep.

There's a phenomenon in criminal investigation which goes by various names but basically it's a form of jumping to premature conclusions. It's like the situation where you get to a murder scene and the victim is a woman and straight away the investigators suspect the husband. They - getting a form of tunnel vision - focus on their suspect and - consciously or not - gather evidence which seeks to support their suspicions he did it while - again consciously or not - ignoring or minimising exculpatory evidence.

This is a case that lends itself to that sort of approach, but I'm sure the investigators won't allow themselves to take that path.

Missourian's posts have been informative and provided a lot of cause to think that this may have nothing at all to do with the current political climate. However the fact that the man was a census-taker and not a revenue-affliated officer (eg ATF) may, just may, mean that the motivation was political, but that's pure speculation on my part.

Motive, method, opportunity - so far we're discussing motive, there's always a lot more to be found out.

exactly
 
 
 
so, are you beginning to see the errors in your OP?

 

I begin to see the error of not including other theories in my OP. All I offered up was a theory. Whether Missourian or I was right, there is a motive that lies in the fact that this person was with the Government.

Diuretic hit the money really. My only real complaint was how some people in this thread act like they would be surprised if a nutjob who has been listening to all of this stuff the past couple weeks finally went out and did something.

You can't discount both what Missourian said and what I said until they have more evidence I suppose. However, you can ask Missourian, I agree he makes plenty of great points.

apparant homicide? there's a doubt? Maybe he was just writing FED across his chest, slipped going to the bathroom, his head fell into a noose that was just lying around and wrapped itself around the board on the cieling.
 
 
The body was left where it could easily be found wasn't it? There was a sort of message scrawled on the body. Why might this be? I only ask because I can think of a couple of reasons why that might be and they're obvious.

1. A political statement
2. A criminal statement

Now, the best evidence available has been left out where investigators can see it, examine it and obtain evidence from it. That means, I think, that the perpetrators were of the mind that they thought they could do so without threatening their apprehension. That's pretty ballsy. Or stupid. Or blatant. Or reckless. But who knows?

so, are you beginning to see the errors in your OP?

 

I begin to see the error of not including other theories in my OP. All I offered up was a theory. Whether Missourian or I was right, there is a motive that lies in the fact that this person was with the Government.

Diuretic hit the money really. My only real complaint was how some people in this thread act like they would be surprised if a nutjob who has been listening to all of this stuff the past couple weeks finally went out and did something.

You can't discount both what Missourian said and what I said until they have more evidence I suppose. However, you can ask Missourian, I agree he makes plenty of great points.

 

First of all, I'd say that anyone who views a census worker as so much of a threat is a nutjob by default.

Secondly, there are always nutjobs in society, and there will always be nutjobs in society, violent or otherwise.

Third, nutjobs, because they ARE nutjobs, have serious perception issues. Jodie Foster loves me, The Catcher in the Rye was my guidance, Helter Skelter told me to start a Black revolution, the purple Teletubby is a subliminal attempt to make our children gay - the list goes on.

Finally, you can advocate censorship in a classic church-lady style, or just accept the fact that there is no way of protecting us all from the nutjobs.

Don't butt into my free speech or anyone else's because of your misplaced altruism (general you) to keep me or my neighbor safe or make my life better. I am safer when I have free speech. I am an adult and I can make my own decisions - good or bad - none of your business or the government's business to decide for me. Least of all with censorship. I do not want us to go down the path of so much of the rest of the world in more and more limits on a fundamental human right of free speech. That sort of crap will be a breaking point for me (and several others I know). "Hate speech" is forbidden, my ass!

Save yourself and turn it off, but don't dare tell me what I can or cannot say or listen to. Boycotte, continue to speak out, etc. - practice your right to speech as well. Keep your (general you) grimey paws off of my speech and choices in information sources. And the funny thing is, I don't even listen to any of these guys.

We DO have a way of knowing...the article reports that the body was already in an advanced state of decomposition by the time authorities discovered it.

Clearly the man was dead long before the 12th.

 
She said investigators have given her few details about her son's death  they told her the body was decomposed  and haven't yet released his body for burial. "I was told it would be better for him to be cremated," she said.

The story relays that the mother said the body was decomposing. Whether this was 12 days after the fact she received this news, we don't know.
By then it would surely be decomposing.

But, we don't know from the story. Details will emerge. Soon, with hopes.

i think there are multiple issues... people refer to the 9/12 or teaparty types as a certain mindset...not necessarily someone incited by watching the particular event... the lead up was pretty nasty, too.

and one can't discount the possibility that the person was incited by all the talk about how the census takers and the ridiculousness from michele bachman which basically told people that the census takers were there to spy on them.

it's difficult to separate the poor guy's death from politics because of the way he died and the message written on him. so clearly the murderer at least wanted us to THINK it was political.

that said, i'm all for sitting back and seeing what the investigation discloses.

If it turns out that whoever killed this man was in fact a right wing nutter you can bet your ass that's what will be written over at WND.

heh.
 
 
As we're looking at political nutjob possibilities, here's another leftwing nutjob who actually has quite the record of violence. Ah, the conspiratorial possibilities are endless when we let our imaginations run away from focus. And since this is once again turning into a partisn issue without any supporting information, I'll join in tossing out reasonable analysis and just keep it partisan.

 

Of course, more tempered individuals might just think let's all just wait before we do any wild political speculations and leaping to conclusions.

but they aren't inciting anyone or anything like that.....

that's just goofy. right?  

 

So provide ANY evidence that A) the supposed murder was committed by a rightwinger. B) that the murder was because he was a Census worker. C) That anyone incited this to happen.

Isn't it funny how the left on this board will scream bloody murder about facts and evidence and how even when presented with them they somehow do not apply if it has anything to do with a leftoid position. But a murder in Kentucky, in a State known for moonshiners and idiots is suddenly, sans any evidence, any facts, the actions of right wing loons bent on overthrowing the Government.
 
 
     

 
 
 
 
 
 
I've said nothing of the sort, except:

Without further information, we have no way of knowing.

You seem to want to carry that to say something it isn't. Why is that?

(and if I were saying that, which I'm not, you're scenario is stupid. People didn't have to be at the event to 'have something to do with it.' Hoards who never attended, or had any plans to, were emotionally caught up in the sentiment.
The build up by Beck, et al went on for weeks and weeks before that. Be a 9-12er!)

Now try one more goddamn time to understand this completely benign statement:

Without further information, we have no way of knowing.

 

ah, so they find the man dead on the 12th, and something that happen on the 12th has even a REMOTE possibility of having an effect on the mans death

 

It could.

How do we know whoever killed man wasn't watching the tea parties on TV all day before the killing?

How do we know the census worker didn't knock on the killer's door while they were watching the 9/12 protests on TV?

Again, we don't know so you can't dismiss that possibility.

 

Ahh yes, I knew you couldn't resist jumping on that wagon.

While that may be true (wouldn't know I don't read WND) there are already pages here where no proof was required to say things just as wacky from a left perspective.

You ever see kids at the mall that try to just step on 1 color of tile, usually the 1 there's a lot less of? So you see them hopping wildly to stay on just that 1 color and avoid the others.

I like you A15, but that's what your post reminded me of.

If you want to point out wackiness there's no reason to wait and see what's proven, we've got pages of wackiness right here and none of it required any proof at all.

why would i do research on a county in VA when this happened in KY?

besides, if you actually read this whole thread you would know this census man was advised to be careful going into that area
 
 
I already posted a link and quoted part of the article showing that the region doesn't trust the federal governement - period.

I don't think where I'm from is quite as backward as the Appalachians but in places where law enforcement or government is seen as a threat it doesn't make much diff what agency you say you're representing, they all get the same welcome. And here's some food for thought that every redneck hick I know already knows: The cops can lie to you.

So put together a general mistrust of the government with the knowledge they can and will lie to you (ask Randy Weaver) and this guy showing up claiming to be from the census...

It's not really hard to imagine how the situation could go very badly.

And if it does turn out to be someone that was "incited" then I think CrusaderFrank made a good point.
 
 
 
I already posted a link and quoted part of the article showing that the region doesn't trust the federal governement - period.

 

Which means it wouldn't take much hateful, inciteful rhetoric to push them over that edge.

Who knows if it was moonshiners or not. The folks in the area did not trust ANYONE from the feds. Look, the cops even told him while he was still aliive to be careful because the folks in the area do not like feds:
 
From the above link:

"...Gilbert Acciardo, a retired Kentucky state trooper who directs an after-school program at the elementary school where Sparkman was a frequent substitute teacher, said he had warned Sparkman to be careful when he did his Census work."I told him on more than one occasion, based on my years in the state police, 'Mr. Sparkman, when you go into those counties, be careful because people are going to perceive you different than they do elsewhere,'" Acciardo said.
"Even though he was with the Census Bureau, sometimes people can view someone with any government agency as 'the government.' I just was afraid that he might meet the wrong character along the way up there," Acciardo said.
Acciardo said he became suspicious when Sparkman didn't show up for work at the after-school program for two days and went to police. Authorities immediately initiated an investigation, he said.
"He was such an innocent person," Acciardo said. "I hate to say that he was naive, but he saw the world as all good, and there's a lot of bad in the world."
Lucindia Scurry-Johnson, assistant director of the Census Bureau's southern office in Charlotte, N.C., said law enforcement officers have told the agency the matter is "an apparent homicide" but nothing else.

 

[Emphasis added]

NO ONE has been inciting to violence at the tea parties

Ah, "hate speech" drove a backwoods Appalachian ridgerunner to hate the feds.

Ban "hate speech", eh?

And who decides what that 'hate speech' is? And, when the GOP is in power, are you going to be cool when they define what that 'hate speech' is? Or when some corporation lobbies legislators to define new 'hate speech', you'll be cool with that?

We don't know for sure, but that is certainly a reasonable possibility. Not because people recently peacefully protested drunken sailor spending; not because they protested the war the last administration and called for the death of GWB; not because of OKC; not because of the TVA; not because of a recent toxic mining spill covering hundreds of miles; but because they are the government. THAT is a rational possiblity.

Yup, that's a pretty good indication, eh? Unless there is some other factor that comes up in the course of the investiagtion, the locals and the feds would be fools to pursue pie-in-the-sky possibilities. And IF any of the investigators approached this with the same sort of partisan agenda we have seen here, they should be immediately separated from their service.

I mean, they didn't write "tea", "Rush/Beck/Fox/whatever", or "Obama" on the dead guy.

Didn't read all this bullshit, after the first three posts it was clear where it was going, the inane 'the right is stiring up this' nonsense.

They said the same thing about the left when the war was protested, the anti-globalism protests, the 2004 elections ect.

Proof again that both sides are the same, behave the same way for the same goals.

Why?

People saying stupid things they know are wrong to support a party happens here all the time, there is no reason to read 6 pages of it.
 
 
This is the same bullshit that Clinton did with OKC: he blamed it on Limbaugh and Republicans when in fact John Doe #2 was Jose Padilla and McVeigh and Nichols were working with Al Qaeda.

What next: did the killer prefer Limbaugh to Glenn Beck?
 
 
 
If it did happen as reported, however unlikely, then its a cautionary tale that we won't go gracefully into the Good Night of Socialism

 

 
 
 
I suppose we should assume this guy is a democrat that lynched him, after all they are the party of Robert KKK "lynch those people" Byrd.

Now doesn't my statement sound as ridiculous as the first 3 posts in this thread?

Yep.

I fucking hate politics sometimes. People take themselves way too fucking seriously. I always think of pinky and the brain. "What are we doing today brain?"

"We're going to try to take over the worlllldd!!!"

That's what everyone thinks when their side's not in power. It makes me giggle, but also sad at the same time. These otherwise tough-guy wannabees hear a sensationalized news story (which the guy sensationalizing it is doing his JOB in hyping it up) and they get all pussy like   and think their whole shit's going to be over-run.

So the 2 right wing nutters that did oklahoma city bombing were working with Alqaeda?    
 
 
I have to say two things. CrusaderFrank is a fucking nutjob that should be scrutinized by the FBI.

I would not, in this political climate, even consider going door to door and claiming I represented the government. Which is sad, because that means the terrorists are winning.
 
 
 
its Kentucky, they likely were moonshiners

 

ACtually that was my first thought, too.

But if I were moonshinging and decided I had to kill a guy who stumbled onto my still, I would't hang the guy up with a sign like that.

I'd bury the body deep.

Wouldn't you?

No, I do think this was either some right wing nutter, or somebody hoping to throw off the cops (which might then means that you are right about those moonshiners as you and I first thought).

Hopefully this investigation will get a followup.

it occurred a bit ago...the fbi are handling the case and mum's been the word from them...even the poor man's mother has not been updated on what happened....just told his body was decomposed and she would need to creme-mate him when she does get to send him to his rest.

In his speech, Clinton referred to the anger in the country as evidenced on things people said on the airwaves. He was correct about that...and it's funny to note that the same seems to be going on once again.

He didn't mention right wing radio, that was how the right wing radio nuts took it, though. And it's also why ClusterFuck didn't link to the actual speech.

Hey seriously though to you have that link about rush's stuff or at least the date the show that he said it was on? I'm trying to find it but when you search for Rush Limbaugh Racist you get a TON of crazy results, none of which have had the context that I want to read/listen to.

I saw that a while back. Crazy people are going to do stupid and crazy things...i blame the person doing the action for making the decision to do the actions.

or pot growers...large business in kentucky....and they do not like anyone interferring...i would hate to think its pot growers...but i do know they boobie trap their fields...and have taken over the state parks when its harvest season...but most of the growing is now hydroponics..which is indoors...and then one must consider meth labs....booming business in kty and they are fucking nutzos who kill without remorse.

Gee, certainly makes one want to visit, doesn't it?
 
 
Well, that would also 'splain the "fed" scrawled on him, as it's unlikely that moonshiners or pot farmers would have any idea about the Federal Reserve.
 
 
 
 
Obama had an ACORN worker kill him to attempt to silence the right-wingers. They'll probably blame it on some poor white guy.

 

Just another night at the Xsited house, eh?

 

 

A nutter misses sarcasm.  

The hilarity of your posts is one of the reasons I keep coming back to USMB.  
 
 
obviously, whoever chose to do this, did so to make a STATEMENT against the Fed...and whether moonshiners, or pot growers, both would have a reason to not want the Fed to do their Census, thinking the census folk are just ATF or the DEA's pawns.

I am not certain we can negate that the civil disobedience and legal protests and radio and tv coverage of such did not have a "part" in all of this... speculation of ours.

Why would this happen on this census and not the previous one...was their less civil unrest now verses then?

I mean, the same families...the proverbial hatfield's and mccoys, lived there on the last census too and had the same operation of "whatever" more than likely back then, but i don't remember hearing about a census person being killed back then?

It took more than one to do this to the man murdered...he was not small and it would take more than one person to HANG A MAN.

And if it was for pot growing, then shouldn't we be talking about pulling these people in to the "system", the grid of gvt and make them share in our tax burdens? Or should they just be left alone to make their living, without government interference or gvt assistance?
 
 
it wouldn't surprise me one bit to find out a libral did this only to start another "war" on the classes.. kinda like Manson's race war. Kill the man, srite Fed and blame it on Republicans. There ain't no low that's too low for the left to go.

I read the topix forum thread for Manchester, KY on this. I think someone said 6 sets of footprints near where the body was found. A couple of students from a history class he substituted for a few weeks ago made comments and there is a lot of comments from people that live in that community. I'm sure the FBI will get to the bottom of it all of the who, what, when, where and why's that are involved. Another local forum for that area someone said this is the second murder there in less than 6 or 7 months.
 
 
Perhaps the killers had given him a big meal of grits and chitlin before they hung 'im and they wanted to make sure whoever found him knew he had been FED.

In his speech, Clinton referred to the anger in the country as evidenced on things people said on the airwaves. He was correct about that...and it's funny to note that the same seems to be going on once again.

He didn't mention right wing radio, that was how the right wing radio nuts took it, though. And it's also why ClusterFuck didn't link to the actual speech.

 

 

Because I've tried several combination of "Clinton hate radio speech" on Google and I get lemons
 
 
 
At least he ate before he died.

 

Actually wouldn't it be proper English to say he was "FED". Then again making fun of some poor soul who was hung is not exactly proper.

its Kentucky, they likely were moonshiners

 

ACtually that was my first thought, too.

But if I were moonshinging and decided I had to kill a guy who stumbled onto my still, I would't hang the guy up with a sign like that.

I'd bury the body deep.

Wouldn't you?

No, I do think this was either some right wing nutter, or somebody hoping to throw off the cops (which might then means that you are right about those moonshiners as you and I first thought).

Hopefully this investigation will get a followup.

 

My first thought was Pot Field, especially after I read the body was found near Daniel Boone National Forest.

Committee on Government Reform, United States House of Representatives

MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES:

Thank you for the opportunity to present the Department’s views on the impacts of drug production on public lands. I am Art Gaffrey, Forest Supervisor, Sequoia National Forest in California. Accompanying me today is Jerry Moore, Special Agent-In-Charge, Pacific Southwest Region in California.

Drug production and cultivation on Federal lands is a significant source of the domestic production and supply of illegal drugs, especially for marijuana (cannabis).

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has identified the major domestic outdoor cannabis cultivation areas in the United States the states of California, Hawaii, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri. Marijuana sites are typically found in the more remote locations on public lands nationwide.

Production is increasing on Federal and State lands as stepped-up law enforcement and drug eradication in urban and rural areas have forced traffickers to move to the seclusion of forests, parks, refuges, and other public lands. Additionally, growing marijuana on Federal lands offers the grower immunity from asset forfeiture laws.  USDA Forest Service - Testimony

no one knew this man, in the rural area where he was killed...

i think it is HIGHLY unlikely that someone killed him for his money and HUNG HIM and wrote FED on his chest/back to cover up the robbery?

it is NOT LIKE anyone even knew he would be in their ISOLATED area, and i seriously DOUBT some strangers were going to traverse THAT BACK COUNTRY to SET UP the backwoodsmen for a murder they did not commit, and NOT GET CAUGHT or killed by the backwoodsmen themselves?

unless you are thinking our own gvt set them up to now come in and raid them, to get to their ''operations''....?   !!!!!!

Not without precedent

"...in the spring of 1972, at Tulane University...students asked (Saul) Alinsky to help plan a protest of a scheduled speech by George H. W. Bush, then U.S. representative to the United Nations - a speech likely to include a defense of the Nixon administration's Vietnam War policies. The students told Alinsky they were thinking about picketing or disrupting Bush's address. That's the wrong approach, he rejoined, not very creative - and besides causing a disruption might get them thrown out of school. He told them, instead, to go to hear the speech dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan, and whenever Bush said something in defense of the Vietnam War, they should cheer and wave placards reading, The KKK supports Bush.' And that is what they did, with very successful, attention-getting results. --

Heh. That's the kind of friend of a friend crap you find there.

I do think this murder was at least encouraged by the talk you're hearing out of the Right Wing Radio. Folks have been warning that the political discourse in this country has turned toxic enough to turn violent and low and behold: a dead census worker.

I expect we'll see worse very soon.

Thank God I have confidence in the investigators not to be whacked out Konspiracy freaks from either end of the spectrum. The perp may actually be found and convicted.

Which, being from a similar area, I can assure is true.

I already posted a link and quoted part of the article showing that the region doesn't trust the federal governement - period.

 

Which means it wouldn't take much hateful, inciteful rhetoric to push them over that edge.

Ban "hate speech", eh?

So that all can remember your inanity - LMAO - you said, "Without further information, we have no way of knowing" in the context of your claim that this murder was motivated by the protests (nothing to support that claim, but you - like a trained seal - reactecd to it as TROOTH) even though the death occured before 9/12, the day of the protests.

They ARE paranoid about the "gubmint" and do believe the crap spewed from TV and talk radio. Those people who were polled and said they weren't sure Obama is a citizen and Hawaii is a state? Those numbnuts are my freakin' relatives  

Honestly, the only people in my family who didn't turn out whacked like the majority of those in this area were the ones who moved away (my Mom and one of her brothers). The rest are... *special*.

Man, I love this. Right-wing pundits make up giant conspiracies about Obama with nary a shred of motivation much less proof, and we're supposed to listen to them and not think they're crazy-assed conspiracy theorists.

But here we have a murder against a category of government worker that right-wing people have specifically railed against, especially Michelle Bachman, with "Fed" carved into his chest.

A Murder where the FBI is specifically investigating anti-government sentiment as a motive...

And WE'RE the "conspiracy theorists"?

ROFL.

OK, let's humor your theory. When is the last timem a Census worker was killed in this region with 'Fed' or something similar carved in their body?

If it's a "common occurence" among those people, it must have happened rather recently, right? So prove it.

Well, that's selective of you. They have hated the government for generations, irrespective of who is in office.

If that is what you mean - without any partisan angle to it - then I agee. But, what do you do? You only bring up recent rhetoric.

Indeed you are a kneejerk rectionary. You and so many others have such a tiny temporal world that revolves around your view alone.

The people of these areas have hated the government for generations.

See how easy it is to be thorough?

Konspiracy freaks rarely are. Kudos.
 
 
 
 
 
Yup, exactly what you wrote, however is:

Kneejerk Konspiratorial reaction. YOU have been no less illogical than any of them.

 

They ARE paranoid about the "gubmint" and do believe the crap spewed from TV and talk radio.....

 

Well, that's selective of you. They have hated the government for generations, irrespective of who is in office.

If that is what you mean - without any partisan angle to it - then I agee. But, what do you do? You only bring up recent rhetoric.

 

Only because it's, ya know, recent.
 
 
 
 
 
Most of my posts (and my initial posts) were regarding DC and the "revenuers" crap.

The only thing I said about hate speech was this:

 AP Source: Census Worker hanged with 'fed' on body 

Which, being from a similar area, I can assure is true.

 

Yup, exactly what you wrote, however is:

 
Ah, "hate speech" drove a backwoods Appalachian ridgerunner to hate the feds.

Ban "hate speech", eh?

And who decides what that 'hate speech' is? And, when the GOP is in power, are you going to be cool when they define what that 'hate speech' is? Or when some corporation lobbies legislators to define new 'hate speech', you'll be cool with that?

 

Kneejerk Konspiratorial reaction. YOU have been no less illogical than any of them.

 

They ARE paranoid about the "gubmint" and do believe the crap spewed from TV and talk radio. Those people who were polled and said they weren't sure Obama is a citizen and Hawaii is a state? Those numbnuts are my freakin' relatives  

Honestly, the only people in my family who didn't turn out whacked like the majority of those in this area were the ones who moved away (my Mom and one of her brothers). The rest are... *special*.

 

Take heart, at least you got your mom. MY mom forwarded a birther e-mail to me yesterday. NOW I've got to worry about her out there in some violent crowd, burning her social security card and flipping off the gubmint with the wrong damned finger. I knew it was a bad idea, her marrying that asshole and moving to Florida, but I never thought it would come to this.  
 
 
 
What 'hate speech" are you talking about?

And, your perception of 'hate speech' is subjective, yet all should have the same perceptions as you? Yeah, this backwooks Appalachian moutain dweller killed a fed because of Tea Party protests. Get over yourself. Irrational and kneejerk.

 

Michele Bachman's insane rants about the Census, which have appeared on just about every right-wing radio or television show.

Have you seriously not heard this woman's insanity? I'm sure I can find MANY examples if you need them.

Mom died in '96, but Dad moved back to that area and has become kinda crazy about this stuff. He doesn't believe the birthers, thank God, but he's not completely immune to the paranoia otherwise.
 
 
 
The people of these areas have hated the government for generations.

 

And hate speech from people like Michele Bachmann only inflame that hatred more.

If you already have a group that hates the government, hate-radio and hate-television is like throwing gasoline on a fire.

What part of that is 'Conspiracy Theorist", or "knee-jerk reactionary"???

If you can prove that things like this happen "all the time" (like maybe once every couple of years) then you have a point, but if not, there's a massive coincidence going on here. One that the FBI is looking into as we speak, I'm sure.

You and others are entering partisan politics in as a dependent variable into this analysis of hatred when it is a constant. The lack of logic is astounding.

My parents have been gone since the late 80's. Both were Reaganites. I remember thinking how my parents would be rolling over in their graves if they knew I voted for Clinton. But then after his first term I wised up and voted for that super old dube. Wasted my vote no matter who I voted for.

My wife grandparents watch that idiot Beck. I am about as conservative as they come but Beck is a fucking nut. I think he does more harm to the republican party than good. Same goes for that candy ass PC prick Hannity.
 
 
 
And, of course, you KNOW the perp used this as just the spark to caudse him/her to murder a fed in backwoods Kentucky.

Irrespective of which party is in power, this area has hated the government for generations.

 

No, I don't "know". I never claimed to "know".

But it's one hell of a coicidence that soon after people like Michelle Bachman fueled the normal hatred these people have for the government with insane rants about the census, this person was killed obviously because he was a census worker.

Now, anyone who knows the first thing about criminal investigation knows that when investigating a crime, one must assume that there ARE no coincidences.

This is not some crazy "conspriracy theory", this is simply stating the obvious.

Anyone who did not participate in the tea Party protest should be even more motivated to do so. With this sort of inane vilification of us, we should all be really pissed off.

Bachman's from the midwest. Farm country.

Backwoods hillbilly hooch brewers, when they vote, vote republican.

And if they listen to radio, you can be sure as hell that they'd gravitate to crazy anti-government conspiracy theorists like Michele Bachmann.

its Kentucky, they likely were moonshiners

 

He had been doing this job in this area for six years, He was Kentucky people. They Knew Him and He Knew Them. Whoever did this, it was either very personal, or one of the righty RWW NUTJOB CREEPO LOONIES got stupid and really ridiculous. It wa'n't random and Census folks from there don't care about moonshiners!

From the above link:

"...Gilbert Acciardo, a retired Kentucky state trooper who directs an after-school program at the elementary school where Sparkman was a frequent substitute teacher, said he had warned Sparkman to be careful when he did his Census work."I told him on more than one occasion, based on my years in the state police, 'Mr. Sparkman, when you go into those counties, be careful because people are going to perceive you different than they do elsewhere,'" Acciardo said.
"Even though he was with the Census Bureau, sometimes people can view someone with any government agency as 'the government.' I just was afraid that he might meet the wrong character along the way up there," Acciardo said.
Acciardo said he became suspicious when Sparkman didn't show up for work at the after-school program for two days and went to police. Authorities immediately initiated an investigation, he said.
"He was such an innocent person," Acciardo said. "I hate to say that he was naive, but he saw the world as all good, and there's a lot of bad in the world."
Lucindia Scurry-Johnson, assistant director of the Census Bureau's southern office in Charlotte, N.C., said law enforcement officers have told the agency the matter is "an apparent homicide" but nothing else.

The Moonshine and Marijuana argument makes no sense in this setting. They found the guy in the area he was known to be working. Killing him and hanging him from a tree with "Fed" on this chest means the FBI is coming in full force. If you want to hide your stills, or your crops, why take an action that you have to know will invite in the FBI en masse.

I still expect this to end with at least on Ruby Ridge style incident. Anyone willing to kill a Census Worker because he was a Fed is probably nuts enough to take a shot at the FBI Agent that shows up asking questions. Once that happens, its all over.

Has Nancy Pelosi’s Fear of Political Violence Been Realized?

9/24/09 at 10:35 AM <snip>

"...This even extends specifically to the census, the constitutionally mandated survey that occurs every ten years. You may recall recently hearing something about the evils of the census from some wide-eyed, hysterical woman — in the subway, perhaps? Nope, that was actually just Minnesota congresswoman Michelle Bachman. Here's Bachman, who had earlier claimed  she would refuse  to fill out her census form,  on Fox News  about three months ago: If we look at American history, between 1942 and 1947, the data that was collected by the census bureau was handed over to the FBI and other organizations, at the request of President Roosevelt, and that’s how the Japanese were rounded up and put into the internment camps. I’m not saying that’s what the administration is planning to do.
But I am saying that private, personal information that was given to the census bureau in the 1940s was used against Americans to round them up."  Has Nancy Pelosi’s Fear of Political Violence Been Realized? -- Daily Intel

I said that there was a good probability that these people, who already had a strong anti-government sentiment, were influenced by the highly inflammatory and very public remarks specifically concerning the US Census by Michelle Bachman and the hosts of the conservative talk shows she was a guest on.

I personally don't think this is my any means a stretch of the imagination, yet you seem to think that stating such an obvious thing is tantamount to some sort of "knee-jerk, conspiracy-theorist reaction" when you haven't even heard the comments involved.

In my view, it is you who are over-reacting, by immediately jumping to defend right-wing media, without even considering that we may have a point.

As I said, what numbers? They would not be relevant at all. If you have stipulated that there has been anti-government culture in the region for generations, then what the fuck are you going to do with numbers? Your strawman.

 

Right, because it's every day that people who have an anti-government sentiment in the United States KILL FEDERAL WORKERS.

In fact, everyone I know that distrusts the government has of course committed murder of a government employee. I mean, who hasn't killed somebody, right?

Your 'Constant' of anti-government sentiment does NOT equate to murder. If it did, there would be a bevy of murders happening continuously in the region.

Usually an escalation of this type has some sort of underlying cause.

 
Now, how is it you equate a constant to a dependent variable? How is it that coincidence is causation.

Don't dodge a third time. That might be embarassing.

 

And we are not talking about a dependent to a constant. Murder like this could in fact happen without the underlying constant, if there was another variable that caused the Murder to happen.

In this case, we are talking about an extreme escalation of what is usually a dull murmur.

What caused this particular escalation to occur? That is the question.
 
 
 
 
In my view, it is you who are over-reacting, by immediately jumping to defend right-wing media, without even considering that we may have a point.

 

I defend free speech. I don't care what your politics are, you have the freedom to assemble, to speak, and to oppose the administration.

Keep your idiotic assumptions about my views to yourself. You will look like a fool if you keep those up.

 

What idiotic assumptions would those be?

Did I call you right-wing? No. I said you were "defending the Right-wing media".

Stop trying to anticipate talking point tactics that are not even being used. You are "assuming", not I.
 
 
 
 
As I said, what numbers? They would not be relevant at all. If you have stipulated that there has been anti-government culture in the region for generations, then what the fuck are you going to do with numbers? Your strawman.

 

Right, because it's every day that people who have an anti-government sentiment in the United States KILL FEDERAL WORKERS.

In fact, everyone I know that distrusts the government has of course committed murder of a government employee. I mean, who hasn't killed somebody, right?

Your 'Constant' of anti-government sentiment does NOT equate to murder. If it did, there would be a bevy of murders happening continuously in the region.

Usually an escalation of this type has some sort of underlying cause.

 
Now, how is it you equate a constant to a dependent variable? How is it that coincidence is causation.

Don't dodge a third time. That might be embarassing.

 

And we are not talking about a dependent to a constant. Murder like this could in fact happen without the underlying constant, if there was another variable that caused the Murder to happen.....

 

Ah. You don't even grasp the concepts. (ummmm....that's dependent variable, not dependent). *shaking my head*

Or, on th off chance...

As it is a given that there is hatered of governement in this reagions, that is a constant - a given. However, when the kneejerk reactionaries say that coincidence is causation, they treat a constant as dependent on the current administration (the variable being the party in control). What you did.

Or, you and others could become rational in this - don't go spouting about ACORN or Tea Party protests causing this. Look at all reasonable possibilities, but concluding or even implying such, is irrational. Your choice on which group with whom you want to associate.
 
 
 
 
 
Read the thread and get better informed. One often looks foolish if they don't.[Emphasis added]

 

And you fuss at us for being conspiratorial  

 

Absolutely. Your ignorance in your (as you said "us") kneejerk reactions is ugly. As ugly as the backwoods ridgerunner who kills a fed. I would wonder how that feels, but I have no interest in knowing.

 

You should know, as you stated the knee-jerk conspiracy theory that these backwoods types hate all gubmint peoples.

Interesting. You're arguing that the region does not have a distrust of the government in general.

Read up, then; and get informed.
 
....

But late in the 19th century, mining, logging and railroad companies moved into the area, often uprooting families and devastating the land.

"They took the people off the land and transferred ownership to owners outside the region who raped the land," says Curtis Wood, a professor of history at Western Carolina and co-author of "From Ulster to Carolina: The Migration of the Scotch-Irish to Southwestern North Carolina." "Rivers were damaged, land wouldn't hold water and forest fires were incredible -- epic forest fires. All this is well-documented."

When the commercial interests had extracted what they could from the area, says Wood, "they pulled out, and the people they left behind were jobless."

In 1911, Congress passed the Weeks Act authorizing the U.S. government to purchase land and create national forests. Millions of acres were acquired and eventually entrusted to the U.S. Forest and Park services and, Wood notes, putting the land out of the reach of local people.

In the 1930s, the Tennessee Valley Authority was created to control floods, improve navigation and provide electrical power in the Southeast. While credited with improving conditions in the area -- including the elimination of malaria -- Wood points out that the TVA also forced many people off their land and flooded entire towns.

"There are very few regions where white people have been forcibly removed from their lands as they have been in southern Appalachia," he says. "The attitudes of Southern mountain people toward the government have been shaped by their experiences.... They've seen their land taken out of their control and put into big programs, leaving them with diminished resources and not much in return."

Government initiatives aimed at dealing with the poverty in the region have often been at "at cross-purposes," he says, and were managed by Washington bureaucracies. "They were never guided by people in the region, and the attitudes of Southern mountain people have been shaped by this, seeing their land taken out of their control and given to big programs."

Another touchy subject, he says, is taxes. Although the federal government is by far the biggest landowner in many western North Carolina counties, it pays no county taxes. It does pay the counties a fee, but it is well below what the land would bring on the open market.

A culture of distrust for government

One of the region's best known industries was the fruit of Appalachian ingenuity and an expression of the contempt some felt for the government.

Today, the streets of downtown Andrews are quiet, and many storefronts lie vacant as merchants move to a stretch of strip malls near the main highway.

"Do you remember what they used to do in these mountains in the '20s and '30s?" area resident David Luther told USA Today. "Moonshine. Who do you think it was that used to lock up our grandfathers for making moonshine?"

The result, says Brown, is a culture thoroughly prepared to distrust the government. "One of the worst things you could hear around here," she says, "was a knock on the door and someone saying, 'I'm from Raleigh, and I'm here to help you.' "

....

 

 CNN.com - Hard times in the mountains - March 5, 2001 

That's just an intro. There is plenty of information available about the general distrust of government in the region and the history associated with that. It's pretty close-mined; just as your general distrust of the opposition is. Great growth medium for the conspiracists, though.
 
 
 
Or, on th off chance...

As it is a given that there is hatered of governement in this reagions, that is a constant - a given. However, when the kneejerk reactionaries say that coincidence is causation, they treat a constant as dependent on the current administration (the variable being the party in control). What you did.

Or, you and others could become rational in this - don't go spouting about ACORN or Tea Party protests causing this. Look at all reasonable possibilities, but concluding or even implying such, is irrational. Your choice on which group with whom you want to associate.

 

I did not mention that it is dependent on the administration. In fact I don't believe I mentioned anything about specific hatred of this administration.

I was talking specifically, about certain people in the media that were drilling up hatred against a specific sector of government workers, Census workers.

Further, I was saying that these people, specifically, were likely to be listened to by this particular group of people. And thus it was likely that the radio programs in question had an incendiary effect on an already touchy situation.

Since neither murders of census workers or Michelle Bachmann's anti-census rants are common occurences, and since they happened at roughly the same time, it seem likely that the two are related.

And trying to prove your point using some made up set of logical variables and equations looks impressive and all, but I have seen people logically disprove the existence of the universe.

Your assertion, put in layman's terms, is that Michelle Bachmann's hate-speech and this muder are simply a coincidence, and the murder would have happened anyway. Mine is that there is a very good chance that the two are indeed related. It seems we will have to agree to disagree.

And there you go with your equating coincidence with causation. Anything is possible, really.

 
.... And trying to prove your point using some made up set of logical variables and equations looks impressive and all, but I have seen people logically disprove the existence of the universe....

 

If you want to be convinced that I made up the concepts of constants and dependent variables and the fallacy of correlation (let alone coincidence) equating to causation, I will be pleased to take that credit.

 
... Your assertion, put in layman's terms, is that Michelle Bachmann's hate-speech and this muder are simply a coincidence, and the murder would have happened anyway.....

 

My 'assertions' are that it is a reasonable possibility based on generations of history with the area and as such, should be included in any thorough analysis of the situation. Some would rather hold their hands over their ears and sing 'la la la' and go after anyone who dares mess with their small world view.

 
.... Mine is that there is a very good chance that the two are indeed related. It seems we will have to agree to disagree.

 

As I said, that is also a possibility, and clearly presenting it as such is much wiser than stating it as a fact.

Has Nancy Pelosis Fear of Political Violence Been Realized?

9/24/09 at 10:35 AM <snip>

"...This even extends specifically to the census, the constitutionally mandated survey that occurs every ten years. You may recall recently hearing something about the evils of the census from some wide-eyed, hysterical woman  in the subway, perhaps? Nope, that was actually just Minnesota congresswoman Michelle Bachman. Here's Bachman, who had earlier claimed  she would refuse  to fill out her census form,  on Fox News  about three months ago: If we look at American history, between 1942 and 1947, the data that was collected by the census bureau was handed over to the FBI and other organizations, at the request of President Roosevelt, and thats how the Japanese were rounded up and put into the internment camps. Im not saying thats what the administration is planning to do.
But I am saying that private, personal information that was given to the census bureau in the 1940s was used against Americans to round them up."  Has Nancy Pelosis Fear of Political Violence Been Realized? -- Daily Intel 

 

More nutter crap. You guys really crack me up.
 
 
 
As I said, that is also a possibility, and clearly presenting it as such is much wiser than stating it as a fact.

 

Looking back, perhaps my statements at points did lead to the hyperbolic, stating a belief that there was a definite connection.

My apologies. My belief is that a connection is strongly likely.
 
 
 
 
 
Bachman's from the midwest. Farm country.

Backwoods hillbilly hooch brewers, when they vote, vote republican.

And if they listen to radio, you can be sure as hell that they'd gravitate to crazy anti-government conspiracy theorists like Michele Bachmann.

 

Wow....Didn't know you were that into keeping up on the voting patterns of hillbillies.

Checked a map lately??...How far is it from the Mason-Dixon line to Bachman's district, and on which side of the line is that district?

 

Kentucky's a border state  

 

how close is it to Michelle Bachmans district

All this being said...

In my opinion, there is a strong possibility that Michele Bachmann and friends threw a lit match onto a pile of dry tinder in this case. It is by no means a certainty, but a strong possibility.

That being the case, it may be wise for authorities to watch for patterns of these types of crimes in the near future, to make sure that things don't go haywire.

It might also be wise for some people in the media to tone down their crazy-talk a bit.

If I was a media personality, or a politician with populist tendencies, and there was the strong possibility that what I say could lead to someone's murder, I think I would be a little more circumspect in what I said on the air in the future.
