Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

 
MIAMI  State figures show that hundreds of welfare applicants in Florida have declined to take drug tests that have been required for the assistance since mid-July.
Thirty-two applicants failed the test, 7,028 passed and 1,597 didnt take it, according figures released Tuesday the Department of Children and Families. People who decline to take the test arent required to explain.

Proponents of the law have suggested applicants would be deterred because they knew they would test positive. Critics say applicants may not have taken the test because they couldnt afford the fee that can be as much as $35 or didnt have easy access to a testing facility.

 

Not sure how I feel about this.

Here's how I feel... then don't take the welfare. If you want the welfare, take the test.
 
 
If it's okay to drug test someone applying for a job it's okay to do the same for someone applying for a handout of other taxpayers' money IMO.

are they doing alcohol testing, too?

either way... are you going to starve people for smoking a joint? pure harassment, imo.
 
 
What is a drug test going to prove? and why is it relevant to receiving welfare? If you're on drugs your kids dont have hunger?
 
 
Why don't all of the state representatives and senators take the test first. Some individual who works for a paper in FL. offered to pay for the testing, not the state, if all went to take the test.
They are on government pay.

You demonstrate the problem in our Government today. Zero common sense.
 
 
Well if they aren't taking the drug test that must mean they have money to buy drugs. Just a guess. I guess they will have to use their drug money and buy food and pay rent. So sorry for the poor downtrodden underdogs. NOT.

The Welfare roles have dropped down her in Florida. Bout time.

Pure harassment? lol nobody is forcing them to take the hand out... to call this harassment is either not knowing what harassment is or just straight diluted thinking

Anyways this is ultimately futile because most people who take drugs know how to get around the test. Well at least the smart ones and the ones able to play the system.

And I'm not sure of your point about alcohol? Do you want them to test for that or not?
 
 
thats crazy crackheads are never waiting for the check

So Sorry.  Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law - The Washington Post 
 
 
Amazing the human race evolved without government welfare. Equally amazing is how America became the richest country in the world without welfare. But then, we did have all those people starving in the streets before welfare took hold in the 60s....right?

Screw the test. Stop the welfare.

That would be a pretty stupid test. As said already, the test costs money which many applicants may not have, not to mention accessibility problems. But why should we bother to take all factors into consideration? We're more interested in selectively using only those factors that give easy answers to our simplistic political demands.

Does being poor in America enough to provide the government with "reasonable cause" under the Constitution for mandatory drug testing?
 
 
 
What is a drug test going to prove? and why is it relevant to receiving welfare? If you're on drugs your kids dont have hunger?

 

How about if you are spending money on drugs that should be spent on food and clothes.
And if you have kids what does it say about you. I remember one couple that would rather by coke than spend money for diapers for their baby. Are you ok with that?
If you want to do drugs go ahead. Just pay for them with your own money.

No, being poor is not "reasonable cause" for mandatory drug testing.

Neither is applying for welfare mandatory.

Both are voluntary.

If you are assaulted, there is no mandate that you report the crime to the police. It's a voluntary act. Should the police start mandating drug tests to ensure that you are sober, and thus giving an accurate reporting?

welll...in an effort to compare apples to apples..

If your NOT reporting the crime cost the government (taxpayer) money, then I can certainly see someone making an argument for what you say...yes.

Furthermore, you are ignoring the one thing that makes this law "for the good" of the recipient....

No drug test means that a drug user could use the money to purchase drugs...in essence, the taxpayer is enabling a drug habit.
Stopping the welfare will give the drug user more "impetus" to seek help...

SO I think it is best you look past the ideological views...and look at the pros of such a law.

Report a crime to the police and your sobriety is certainly judged to lawful standards, if there is probable cause to believe your sobriety is in connection to certain crimes than yes they will "mandatory-ily" drug test you.

I'm quite certain the state of Fla. has the capacity to decide if their laws work for the state of Fla. We don't need you doofus to decide. Like I said. spend your drug money on food, test clean and if you still need help.. well then we'll take your applications.

Checks can be cased for money.

Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

 
MIAMI  State figures show that hundreds of welfare applicants in Florida have declined to take drug tests that have been required for the assistance since mid-July.
Thirty-two applicants failed the test, 7,028 passed and 1,597 didnt take it, according figures released Tuesday the Department of Children and Families. People who decline to take the test arent required to explain.

Proponents of the law have suggested applicants would be deterred because they knew they would test positive. Critics say applicants may not have taken the test because they couldnt afford the fee that can be as much as $35 or didnt have easy access to a testing facility.

 

Not sure how I feel about this.

 

1,597 + 32 + 1,629 stoners who have been sucking up taxpayers money. Now they ain't.

What if they die without assistance.

SO I think it is best you look past the ideological views...and look at the pros of such a law.

 

Reporting crime to the police DOES cost taxpayer money. Investigating the crime, time spent filling out paperwork, time in court if the perp is found, detention costs if convicted, etc. All because you reported someone taking your wallet, and all of its $5, at gun point.

There is a vested interest in the government, and for the taxpayer, to minimize false or inaccurate reports to police. So why can't that be sufficient to require people to take drug tests before reporting crimes to police?

The problem with "looking past ideology" is that the "ideology" we're talking about is constitutional rights. If we are ready to agree that our constitutional rights are drastically reduced from what they have previously been understood to be, then what good was the constitution in the first place?

I worked nearly 30 years before I retired....I never had to take a drug test for any job that I held.

Upper management NEVER has to take drug tests, and the corps that I worked for did not test their corporate office or field workers either. they only drug tested the employees that worked in the distribution center, because a lot of dangerous equipment to move the goods were present and needed to be operated.

No one in an office setting was drug tested. If they did not performed their job, then they were fired after the proper amount of write ups. they were not fired for doing drugs on their time off....they were fired if they could not perform the job they were paid to do...period.

As upper management, not once did I ever fire a person because of drugs....and I fired 11 out of the 12 employees I inherited at a new managers job once....leaving me and the 1 employee running the show until I could hire more...but again, not one of these people were fired for doing drugs, but for not doing their job and a few for stealing.

WIC checks CANNOT be CASHED!

Food stamps CAN be sold just like anything else like pussy or blow jobs. Will a Drug Dealer take food stamps over money, no? Will he take pussy or blow jobs, maybe but not always... but that has shit to do with your last point, which I agree with. They should take care of their kids but dont. So, what about the kid?

First I don't care if they have children or not. If you are getting any assistance you should not be buying anything that is not needed to live. No drugs, booze, soda, junk food, video games or any such.
If you do have kids though and are buying drugs instead of other things like clothes you are pure scum. Or you are gaming the system, which makes you worse than scum because you are stealing money. Money that could be used for those that really needed.

Upper management NEVER has to take drug tests, and the corps that I worked for did not test their corporate office or field workers either. they only drug tested the employees that worked in the distribution center, because a lot of dangerous equipment to move the goods were present and needed to be operated.

No one in an office setting was drug tested. If they did not performed their job, then they were fired after the proper amount of write ups. they were not fired for doing drugs on their time off....they were fired if they could not perform the job they were paid to do...period.

As upper management, not once did I ever fire a person because of drugs....and I fired 11 out of the 12 employees I inherited at a new managers job once....leaving me and the 1 employee running the show until I could hire more...but again, not one of these people were fired for doing drugs, but for not doing their job and a few for stealing.

 

So I take it then that you are fine with doctors, nurses, firemen policemen, teachers, truck drivers, and bus driver taking drugs.. everyone should be able to take drugs and not have their privacy invaded.... whoooopppeeee, then why did they pass a "DRUG FREE WORKPLACE" legislation????
 
 
 
 
 
How about if you are spending money on drugs that should be spent on food and clothes.
And if you have kids what does it say about you. I remember one couple that would rather by coke than spend money for diapers for their baby. Are you ok with that?
If you want to do drugs go ahead. Just pay for them with your own money.

 

I dont get it, drugs arent paid for with WIC checks and food stamps. Money pays for it.

Even if a couple is a drug user and spends all their money on drugs, what does that have to do with their child?

 

First I don't care if they have children or not. If you are getting any assistance you should not be buying anything that is not needed to live. No drugs, booze, soda, junk food, video games or any such.
If you do have kids though and are buying drugs instead of other things like clothes you are pure scum. Or you are gaming the system, which makes you worse than scum because you are stealing money. Money that could be used for those that really needed.

 

okay, taking ALL OF THAT in to consideration, how do you feel about corporations and banks taking TARP bail out monies, isn't that assistance with tax payer's money? and how about any company that gets a tax subsidy? Should they be required to be drug tested as well or their companies receive no gvt assistance?

What about all of you with children that takes the gvt $1000 child credit, should they be drug tested as well? Or on unemployment, them too? or on food stamps, them too? or receiving SS for goodness sakes...how about them, should we be drug testing them?

Where will it end, when no one is left standing?
 
 
 
 
 
it is an invasion of privacy....and as someone who does not do drugs, I would still not take the test....on principle alone....and hopefully win my case in court. Innocent people should not be forced to do this....under any circumstances in my book.

 

it is commonplace in the working world...as it is a necessity for the safety of co-workers.

Do you not see the upside for the user in this case? It may prompt the user to seek help.

And it will eliminate the taxpayer from being the enabler of the habit.

times have changed.
Here in NY, if an employee has drugs on his/her possession while in the workpolace, the employer may be held liable as an "accessory" if that person is arrested on the premises.
If a drug transaction takes place on the premises, the business owner IS held liable.

Maybe if we go back to a world of personal responsibility, we could get rid of the drug testing idea all around.

But in the meantime, you cant expect to NOT be respoinsible for yourself but get all oif the freedoms associated with being reponsible for yourself.

You're not being forced to take the drug test because no one is forcing you to go on the dole. One has to apply for benefits and the test is simply part of the application process.
 
 
 
You demonstrate the problem in our Government today. Zero common sense.

 

Jillian has the intellect of a bag of hammers.

I support full legalization of drugs. Along with this I support the ability of employers to test to protect themselves as well as the testing of those on public assistance.

Freedom, a concept the left just can't grasp.

This is a drug trest.....and in return you can get something.

You opt to not take the drug test, no arrest, no fine....you just dont get what it is you wanted.

Sort of like the sign of a restaurant....."no shirt, noi serviice"

Does that take away ones freedom?

I just don't see it that way.

and if you take it that way, then anyone applying for gvt assistance, those in agriculture receiving subsidies, in the oil business receiving gvt subsidies, or any business reciving gvt assistance needs to have all employees drug tested or at least all of upper management in these businesses that receive gvt money, or those taking a child tax credit, or unemployment or social security should have to take a drug test in order to receive that assistance....

fair and just, no?
 
 
 
 
 
I dont get it, drugs arent paid for with WIC checks and food stamps. Money pays for it.

 

Checks can be cased for money. Food Stamps can be sold, usually they are sold as some reduced value (say $20 in food stamps sells for $10 in cash, the purchaser can then buy $20 of Food Stamp eligible food, or, sell the stamps for $15 and make a 50% profit on investment - not a bad return as long as you don't get caught).

 
Even if a couple is a drug user and spends all their money on drugs, what does that have to do with their child?

 

If the money is being paid to support the child, then it should be used to support the child not buy drugs.

>>>>

 

WIC checks CANNOT be CASHED!

Food stamps CAN be sold just like anything else like pussy or blow jobs. Will a Drug Dealer take food stamps over money, no? Will he take pussy or blow jobs, maybe but not always... but that has shit to do with your last point, which I agree with. They should take care of their kids but dont. So, what about the kid?

Its easy to say what the parents should do, but when they dont, what are you for?

 

Any exchange medium can be "cashed", whether it's conversion directly to money or to goods that are sold it's still "cashed".

Didn't say the drug dealer would take food stamps over cash (although they could). There are probably criminals that deal directly with scamming Food Stamps for cash.

I don't have a problem with it as it's voluntary. You voluntarily apply for government hand outs not one person has ever been forced to take government aid.

Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

 
MIAMI  State figures show that hundreds of welfare applicants in Florida have declined to take drug tests that have been required for the assistance since mid-July.
Thirty-two applicants failed the test, 7,028 passed and 1,597 didnt take it, according figures released Tuesday the Department of Children and Families. People who decline to take the test arent required to explain.

Proponents of the law have suggested applicants would be deterred because they knew they would test positive. Critics say applicants may not have taken the test because they couldnt afford the fee that can be as much as $35 or didnt have easy access to a testing facility.

 

Not sure how I feel about this.

 

Its a total waste of time and energy. Synthetic piss can be bought for less then 20$ in any city that will pass any drug test.

I know from experiance.

I hold a Director level position, I was drug tested. Everyone on my staff was drug tested (IT.) Our facilities manager was injured, he was tested. Our current president was hired as a production manager, HE was tested, I know, I filled out his clinic slip.

Most companies drug test, at every level. A company that tested line workers and not management is setting themselves up for a lawsuit.

I'm sure. FUCK EM

If you can't pass a piss test for your job you don't get to work. Why should these people be allowed to do nothing, get high and then get paid?

It will force many to get clean which will only have positive effects.

are they doing alcohol testing, too?

either way... are you going to starve people for smoking a joint? pure harassment, imo.

 

alcohol is legal. They are testing for illegal drugs or drugs they are not prescribed  
 
 
 
I don't think welfare is a constitutionally guaranteed right so the state has the ability to hold recipients to whatever criteria they please.

 

Well, seeing as nobody has said anything about welfare being a constitutional right, would you like to move along to the constitutional protects of searches without reasonable cause?
 
 
 
But it's not freedom if you are FORCED to take a drug test for no reason of your own accord, in my book.

 

In theory, the police cannot randomly stop people on the street and search them. BUT if you go into an airport, you WILL be searched. By going into the airport, you agree to be searched. Same with welfare, by accepting welfare, the recipient agrees to be drug tested.

It's implied consent.

Does being poor in America enough to provide the government with "reasonable cause" under the Constitution for mandatory drug testing?

 

I think it's perfectly reasonable when asking for free, taxpayer provided dollars, to be reasonably certain you're not spending the money on drugs.

Welfare is not a mandatory program.
 
 
The state of Georgia takes welfare every second of every day from the Feds.
Do we all have to take a drug test?
Do they test for prescription dope where they do not have a prescription?
No.
And prescription drug overdoses now lead illegal drugs at emergency rooms 10 to 1.

I don't think you known much about search and seizure law. The government has a limited ability to conduct searches that are LIMITED in scope, for a limited set of purposes and criteria. In the case of airport security, there is a compelling government interest to preserve public safety which outweights the limited intrusion to privacy of a routine security screening at an airport. (As a personal note, my opinion is that the new body scanner devices cross that line of "limited" search and tip the scales back to the side of privacy. But that's just me and I don't believe it's been in the courts.) Accordingly, the legality of government searches in the scope of airport security screening does not arise from the notion of voluntariness, but of falling within a limited field of reasonableness for the purposes of the 4th amendment.

Good point.
Problem is the drug tests do not reveal any prescription drug levels even if they are 10 times over what they should be.
Drug testing is a joke. Everyone that does it in my line of work knows it. Anyone can pass them as most do not hair follicle test which is the only reliable way to do it.

Okay, one of two things are happening here:

1) You're intentionally being dishonest by equivocating "reasonable" into a new meaning that does not actually apply in the relevant context.

2) You are ignorant of what "reasonable cause" means in the constitution.

Which is it?

The article doesn't specifically state that those who declined to take the test did not get their welfare check.

I know that would be a reasonable assumption, but...
 
 
No one wants to address who the welfare benefits?

Drug users are bad but a drug users kid has nothing to do with it.
 
 
 
Should
Doctors
Nurses
Bus Drivers
Teachers
Firemen
Policemen
Be drug tested?

 

Most jobs have mandatory drug testing to get the job and then random drug testing during the year
 
 
 
 
The state of Georgia takes welfare every second of every day from the Feds.
Do we all have to take a drug test?
Do they test for prescription dope where they do not have a prescription?
No.
And prescription drug overdoses now lead illegal drugs at emergency rooms 10 to 1.

 

You are wrong. And besides that.. your ass has it bass ackwards.. The Government is the Welfare state.. They get their money from the States.. So Georgia pays into the kitty and gets a share back.. got that now? Thanks.

 

"their fair share"      
"They get their money from the States"      
Uh, earth to Willow, come in.
The states PAY NO TAXES. PEOPLE pay taxes.
Politicians redistribute taxes. And it IS NOT equitable EVER.
Every cent given back to the states is the same as welfare. Taxes collected at the point of a gun by government, plundered from working folks,sent to Washington and redistributed according to partisan political decisions both Democrat and Republican.
You are a closet liberal.
 
 
 
No one wants to address who the welfare benefits?

Drug users are bad but a drug users kid has nothing to do with it.

 

Then take the kid til the user stops using. Then give the kid back. But do not under any circumstances subsidize drug use. That's not fair to the taxpayers. Some day in the world the fucking taxpayer should catch a break and someone should give them a little consideration instead of just pissing the money away willy nilly.

Drug tests are JOKE. I have been in the security/detective business for 32 years.
Most of the worst prescription drugs are not tested. HIPPA bans them from asking what you are on if you take prescription drugs. It bans them from even asking if you have a prescription for it. You can eat all of those pills you want.
All that is tested are the illegal opiates-some of the opiates that are prescription WILL show up but most other legal drugs with a prescription will not.
Buy all those on the internet all day long without a prescription and do as much as you want and there will be nothing shown on the drug tests.
 
 
 
 
Does being poor in America enough to provide the government with "reasonable cause" under the Constitution for mandatory drug testing?

 

I think it's perfectly reasonable when asking for free, taxpayer provided dollars, to be reasonably certain you're not spending the money on drugs.

Welfare is not a mandatory program.

 

Being mandatory or not is not the issue - just because some Americans are poor is not "reasonable cause" that they are all drug users.

If receiving "taxpayers dollars" is the criteria, then why aren't ALL individuals on the government payroll, including the president, his/her staff, members of Congress, Supreme Court Justices, etc. subject to the same rules.

That would open up a constitutional "can-of-worms" of those who would resent having "big government" intrude into their personal lives without "reasonable cause."
 
 
 
 
Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

 
MIAMI  State figures show that hundreds of welfare applicants in Florida have declined to take drug tests that have been required for the assistance since mid-July.
Thirty-two applicants failed the test, 7,028 passed and 1,597 didnt take it, according figures released Tuesday the Department of Children and Families. People who decline to take the test arent required to explain.

Proponents of the law have suggested applicants would be deterred because they knew they would test positive. Critics say applicants may not have taken the test because they couldnt afford the fee that can be as much as $35 or didnt have easy access to a testing facility.

 

Not sure how I feel about this.

 

are they doing alcohol testing, too?

either way... are you going to starve people for smoking a joint? pure harassment, imo.

 

Drugs are expensive, nay...drugs are REAL expensive.
So just maybe a person who can afford drugs can afford food. Or just maybe the welfare money is just enough to support the drug habit.
Either way...the government shouldn't give taxpayer money to people who can afford expensive drugs.
 
 
 
anyone who fills out the irs long form should be drug tested...

 

The IRS long form violates the 4th Amendment, yet your concern is with those who take welfare...

 
they are taking deductions that make them pay less taxes than me which means my taxes go towards supporting them...DRUG TEST THEM NOW!  

 

Idiocy

 
who would have thought that our personal right to privacy would be blown to smithereens just because of taxes....?

 

Says the one who just spoke in favor on the 1040...

Forget what you feel... what do you think?

The taxpayers deserve to know that thier funds garnered by taxation is going to go for it's intended purpose, (food, clothing, shelter)...and nothing else.

After all weren't they being responsible when they paid the taxes? Why shouldn't recipients be responsible for the proper use of thier funding?

Oh, and uhm...it's a hand-up...not a way of life...no making the safety net a hammock.
 
 
 
Drugs are expensive, nay...drugs are REAL expensive.
So just maybe a person who can afford drugs can afford food. Or just maybe the welfare money is just enough to support the drug habit.

 

Or maybe, more logically under your premises, drugs are TOO EXPENSIVE in the first place for anyone who falls into the income qualifications for public assistance.
 
 
You want to a job working at my plant? You will be required to pass a criminal background and a drug test.
Deal with it.
 
 
 
[The taxpayers deserve to know that thier funds garnered by taxation is going to go for it's intended purpose, (food, clothing, shelter)...and nothing else.

 

Maybe we should require STD testing too. You know, because we wouldn't want people using their food stamps to buy hookers.

"Doctors, Teachers, Nurses, Firemen Policemen, truck drivers" are all in positions of added responsibility when it comes to safety/wellbeing of the public. Many are already on government payrolls, and those who aren't are subject to government licencing which could be used to require "drug testing."

"Drug testing" welfare recipients is an easy target, how about "drug testing" anyone/everyone who receives a government "tax cut" - the Republicans/Tea Party would suddenly be tripping all over each other trying to protect the constitutional rights of that group!
 
 
Next the lefties here will say it's racially motivated and that these folks civil rights are being violated because they are being asked to take a drug test in order to get assistance.

It really belongs to the government and we cheat them out of what is rightfully theirs every time we get paid.

I can't believe how many on the left have such an issue with Americans wanting to keep as much of our money as possible.

Alcohol is an illegal drug?

What next - ? Tobacco?

If you're smoking/taking something illegal, you shouldn't be entitled to law abiding taxpayer's dollars.

I could almost be about the same... in not having an opinion yet but some things do bother me at the onset of this.

ONE: Poor people are sometimes most obviously the farmed ones. What does that mean? That means that sometimes 'we' that fall within or under the poverty levels within our states are left to self-medicating or coming up with our own healthcare alternatives. Yes, sadly, that does sometimes mean tapping into the yet to be legal things...

TWO: The classification that poor people deserve to be tested. This is sometimes a biggy because many poor people genuinely have no clue what the testing is really about. Does poor mean ignorant? I don't mean such, I mean that they may not be exposed to the things in which the corporations examining the test results are looking for.

THREE: A HORRID waste of money. Yep... another one of 'those' things deemed necessary by the higher officials.

Is drug usage and/or alcoholism a problematic issue in the given area(s)? Is gang violence? What about Domestic Violence? Seriously? Before I would completely support this kind of testing it seems so many more questions should be sufficiently answered. It is ONE thing to have known drug usage and/or alcoholism within area(s) and quite another to have problematic violence issues potentially stemming from such things.

I don't have these thoughts from ignorance or lack of exposure. My experience and exposures have taught me that there can be and HAS BEEN much hope in these supposedly bad and/or disdainful habits for some individuals who have them.
 
 
 
Or maybe, more logically under your premises, drugs are TOO EXPENSIVE in the first place for anyone who falls into the income qualifications for public assistance.

 

Do you think cocaine and heroin should be subsidized by the government, you know, for the needy?

because you are letting them keep their tax monies by giving a certain group a deduction or credit while NOT giving another person a credit to reduce their taxes? is that fair?

Do you think cocaine and heroin should be subsidized by the government, you know, for the needy?

 

Why in the world would you even propose a question like that? Nobody has even suggested anything like that, it has nothing to do with the discussion. Is this your M.O., to randomly make comments and ask questions as if to imply people who disagree with you have said outlandish things that they never said at all? You know what, don't answer. Get on topic or stay on the sidelines.
 
 
 
What is a drug test going to prove? and why is it relevant to receiving welfare? If you're on drugs your kids dont have hunger?

 

If you're on drugs, the money you get from the taxpayers is paying for them when it should be going to support your kids.

That said, I don't think they should be required to pay $35 for the test or to travel somewhere to get the test. If the government wants them tested, they should go to them.

Ah brilliant logic...

So anyone not robbed at gun point should be drug tested to see if they are worthy of keeping the funds they were not robbed of...

NO they don't have the right to invade another's right to privacy, just "because", imho. And as it has shown much more than a majority, actually much much more than a majority of these people are law abiding citizens and YOU have no right to treat them or presume that they are, like scum of the earth, drug addicts. Mind your own business. If you want to get rid of welfare, then shoot to do that....but to have the gvt invade their privacy just because you don't like them or the welfare they receive is simply wrong and a very very very slippery slope.

Drug testing was initially allowed by employers for jobs of responsibility and or dangerous jobs....I was against it then because I KNEW IT WOULD LEAD to this kind of crap...I suppose as long as it is not you personally, you are okay with it.... well, I am not....it gives power to the government that is not in our constitution imo.
 
 
 
 
No one wants to address who the welfare benefits?

Drug users are bad but a drug users kid has nothing to do with it.

 

Then take the kid til the user stops using. Then give the kid back. But do not under any circumstances subsidize drug use. That's not fair to the taxpayers. Some day in the world the fucking taxpayer should catch a break and someone should give them a little consideration instead of just pissing the money away willy nilly.

 

So you're against something you have no proof is happening. Welfare doesn't subsidize drug use, until you prove such you're lying to make a point that doesn't exist.

No one is invading their privacy. They dont have to sign up for the assistance if they dont want to test. Just as if you dont have to test if you dont want the job. It is a personal choice to take the check...just as it is a personal choice to take a job. You know going in what the requirements will be. Take it or leave it.

it's simply wrong.

shoot to get rid of welfare if you don't like giving it out....that's how I view it.
 
 
 
 
I don't think welfare is a constitutionally guaranteed right so the state has the ability to hold recipients to whatever criteria they please.

 

Well, seeing as nobody has said anything about welfare being a constitutional right, would you like to move along to the constitutional protects of searches without reasonable cause?

 

The searches are voluntary.

People consent to the search as part of the process of applying for government hand outs.

No one is being forced against their will to apply for a hand out.
 
 
 
Most jobs have mandatory drug testing to get the job and then random drug testing during the year

 

False.

As an overall percentage, very few companies do pre-employment drug tests. And of those, even fewer do random drug tests.
 
 
 
 
[I don't have a problem with it as it's voluntary. You voluntarily apply for government hand outs not one person has ever been forced to take government aid.

If you want tax payer money then take the drug test. Your choice 100%

 

Same thing could be said about reporting crime to the police. Do you have no problem with police requiring drug tests for you to report a crime?

 

Not the same thing at all.

You really don't believe the cops and a welfare office perform the same function do you?
 
 
 
No one wants to address who the welfare benefits?

Drug users are bad but a drug users kid has nothing to do with it.

 

Then the kids can be removed from the drug addicts care as they should be anyway.
 
 
why not? if one person making 80 grand gets to pay less taxes than another person making 80 grand because of some tax credit or write off then the one person without the write off is paying more of their pay in taxes than you are, therefore, they should have the right to demand from you, a drug test.....that's basically what you are saying about the welfare crowd...

slippery slippery slope.

No, i dont think so Care. It is still voluntary.... yes, they have a choice. The don't have to apply for the assistance. No one is forcing them to take the assistance.

I am not in any way saying that any of the people are on drugs. If they have nothing to hide...they also have nothing to worry about. It will however, winnow out the ones who ARE on drugs and do NOT deserve government money to help them continue on drugs.

Getting rid of welfare is not a good idea. Getting rid of the ones who don't deserve it or are abusing the system is a good idea.
 
 
Shouldn't recipients of corporate welfare be drug tested as well? Certainly no one could argue against those CEOs being tested.
 
 
 
The searches are voluntary.

People consent to the search as part of the process of applying for government hand outs.

No one is being forced against their will to apply for a hand out.

 

And as we've already addressed, that's as good as saying that the police have a right to require you to take a drug test before you can report a crime. Nobody is forcing you to report the crime.
 
 
 
 
No one wants to address who the welfare benefits?

Drug users are bad but a drug users kid has nothing to do with it.

 

Then the kids can be removed from the drug addicts care as they should be anyway.

 

who's gonna fund that? and shouldn't that be up to a social worker whether a child gets removed from the family?

the point is that you want to treat many many many many innocent, drug free people as if they were criminals, just because some of your taxes, very very very very little of those taxes btw, goes towards welfare for them.

that's bull crud from the get go.
 
 
 
Not the same thing at all.

You really don't believe the cops and a welfare office perform the same function do you?

 

Logically, it is the EXACT same thing. The same rationale is being used. Police are providing government services. The Social Services office is provided government services. The underlying element to all of this, which you simply don't want to admit, is that the "voluntary" nature of using government services does not alleviate the government of constitutional protections when it requires services be predicated on a search.
 
 
 
False.

As an overall percentage, very few companies do pre-employment drug tests. And of those, even fewer do random drug tests.

No one wants to address who the welfare benefits?

Drug users are bad but a drug users kid has nothing to do with it.

 

Then the kids can be removed from the drug addicts care as they should be anyway.

 

Yep.
 
 
 
 
 
No one is invading their privacy. They dont have to sign up for the assistance if they dont want to test. Just as if you dont have to test if you dont want the job. It is a personal choice to take the check...just as it is a personal choice to take a job. You know going in what the requirements will be. Take it or leave it.

 

YOU know that's just bulloney syrenn....they have no choice in this...they wouldn't be applying for it if they made enough to support themselves and their children....so you are forcing them to submit to their gvt for something that is NONE of their gvt's business.....it's none of the gvt's business, PERIOD. and as shown, many times over, the majority of these people are NOT taking drugs....and probably never have taken drugs and probably never will take drugs....yet YOU seem to want to treat them like they are guilty....

it's simply wrong.

shoot to get rid of welfare if you don't like giving it out....that's how I view it.

 

No, i dont think so Care. It is still voluntary.... yes, they have a choice. The don't have to apply for the assistance. No one is forcing them to take the assistance.

I am not in any way saying that any of the people are on drugs. If they have nothing to hide...they also have nothing to worry about. It will however, winnow out the ones who ARE on drugs and do NOT deserve government money to help them continue on drugs.

Getting rid of welfare is not a good idea. Getting rid of the ones who don't deserve it or are abusing the system is a good idea.

 

they have to take the assistance or starve or let their children starve...they wouldn't be there if they had the means to support themselves...it has a cap of 2 years only.

and yes, there may be SOME, or a FEW that are not in that kind of bind and are trying to game the system....but they will be there whether you drug test the innocent or you don't.

if you choose to drug test this one small group just because they are getting a drip of your taxes paid, then you will need to drug test every single soul that receives gvt subsidies, gvt bailouts, gvt EICredits, gvt child tax credits, gvt grants for college....etc etc etc etc etc....all of those things above can then be drug tested based on this precedence and that will never happen, or you hope that will never happen....more of our taxes will be going towards drug testing than the subsidies or assistance itself....it is ridiculous! And wasteful. I don't want my tax dollars going towards drug tests on the innocent....nor should you, again, imho.
 
 
It sound's like some people presume that if you apply for public assistance for your family you are a "mooch, criminal, drug user"....etc etc etc.

Some of you want to punish the poor for being poor. What else is new?

Removed by who? Big Government?

Or they could, you know, like not use their money to buy drugs.....

 
they wouldn't be there if they had the means to support themselves...it has a cap of 2 years only.

Your alleged logic is beyond faulty.
 
 
I work for in a small, poor, rural county where joblessness is at 22%. Without UI, food stamps and cash aid a lot of children would starve. We have drug problems in our community too. Meth labs out in the hinterland of the county, and we have a medical marijuana initiative that allows anyone with a 215 card to grow six plants.

And for all of that Care... Welfare is still voluntary, it is a choice to apply for the assistance. They are not forced.

If they refuse to test they dont get a check. The rules are clearly stated before they apply. Just as with any job, you want a job that requires a drug test, you take the drug test....or you dont get the job. If you dont want to test....don't apply. Personal choice.

This is the thing, the fact that they are "voluntarily" applying does not magically make the REQUIRED search constitutionally permissible. That would be like saying that since you choose to drive a car, the government can stop you any time they want and search you and your car. Yes, you choose to drive. But that does not mean the government can simply adopt requirements attached to it that will force you to forsake your constitutionally protected privacy.
 
 
 
 
False.

As an overall percentage, very few companies do pre-employment drug tests. And of those, even fewer do random drug tests.

Interesting claim to be sure. But I wish they would've given more detail about the actual survey since it conflicts with everything I've ever read. I've yet to be given an employment drug test, nor do I know anyone personally that has ever had to take one.

Your alleged logic is beyond faulty.

 

no it is not faulty, it is realistic...

AND AS THE RESULTS SHOW, you are not drug testing just drug users, you are drug testing thousands of innocent people.....

are you willing to allow the gvt to drug test you, just because you are taking a $1000 dollar child tax credit?

Are you willing to allow the gvt to have you submit to a drug test because you are receiving a college grant?

Are you willing to have the gvt force corporate ceos to a drug test that received bail out money?

Where will it end?

Or are you just concerned with the poorest among us?

what's the purpose of the drug test? if you say they are getting your tax money...then so are alot of other people and entities, are you really willing to have our gvt drug test all of them monthly and pay for it?

it's bullcrud uncensored! It really is..

I take it you have never heard of a field sobriety test. You want to drive... they have the right to test you. However you have a good point... drug testing should be required for all drivers licenses.

Sure it it permissible. The requirements of receiving a check are a clean drug test... no one is forcing them to test.

And personal responsibility.
 
 
Amazing the hurdles repubs advocate for (welfare drug testing, voter picture ID's) while screaming for less government. The fact that Florida wasted a Ron of money on drug testing since very few were users, and still claim fiscal conservatism as well.
 
 
 
 
I worked nearly 30 years before I retired....I never had to take a drug test for any job that I held.

Upper management NEVER has to take drug tests, and the corps that I worked for did not test their corporate office or field workers either. they only drug tested the employees that worked in the distribution center, because a lot of dangerous equipment to move the goods were present and needed to be operated.

No one in an office setting was drug tested. If they did not performed their job, then they were fired after the proper amount of write ups. they were not fired for doing drugs on their time off....they were fired if they could not perform the job they were paid to do...period.

As upper management, not once did I ever fire a person because of drugs....and I fired 11 out of the 12 employees I inherited at a new managers job once....leaving me and the 1 employee running the show until I could hire more...but again, not one of these people were fired for doing drugs, but for not doing their job and a few for stealing.

 

I hold a Director level position, I was drug tested. Everyone on my staff was drug tested (IT.) Our facilities manager was injured, he was tested. Our current president was hired as a production manager, HE was tested, I know, I filled out his clinic slip.

Most companies drug test, at every level. A company that tested line workers and not management is setting themselves up for a lawsuit.

 

True, insurance is cheaper. Any injury on the job requires it.

Doesnt change the fact that anyone that wanted to pass a piss test could for less then 20$. Same with a hair folical test.

Just more false sense of security.
 
 
 
 
Society has every right to demand limits be set when they are footing the bill. The moochers should be thankful.

 

This is ASSUMING, of course, that the MOOCHERS are not already serving some purpose toward society. What of community service and volunteers? What of the farming facts? What of the many young and beautiful girls that come from such grounded bases?  

 

Calm yerself. The responsible ones that lost thier jobs for no fault of thier own for whatever reason and are still being responsible and looking aren't really the ones that I'm speaking of.

I speak to the ones squirting out babies just to get a check...subjecting themselves to inept and absent fathers...using the funds for other than the purposes they are meant...you know? Irresponsibility.

But if anyone takes the public dole...they should also be subject to the same thing. Those paying the bill have every right to demand it.

Lady justice wears a blind for a reason.
 
 
I had a few sticking points before answering this important question about drug testing for entitlement checks. What if they didn't take the test because a) the testing facility was not convenient for them, b they had no transportation or c) they didn't have money to pay for the test.

Any one of those situations does not make them poor candidates for the funds. I would suggest that those without transportation get in touch with a DTD Drug Testing Driver, a van who could pick up those and take them to a the drug testing facility and retun them home. If they were unable to pay for the test, $35.00 would be deducted for the test and the could have the remainder in a check form. The DTD would not be costly considering there would be fewer people taking the drug test and fewer people taking the checks.

This is tax payer money intended to help people in need to feed, clothes and provide shelter for themselves and their children. If the money is used for other purposes, drugs for example, it violates the purpose of the law. If the person tests positive for drugs, either recipient isn't using entitlemnt money and they have enough funds to provide for their family or they are using tax payer funds. No check.

Grow up and get clean. It's time society stops enabling.

workplace drug testing laws are governed by each state. I have never been drug tested, nor my husband, in massachusetts or maine.

here is my state laws now on it

 
Maine State Law--Drug Testing
Contact Information: Law and Legislative Reference Library

Augusta, ME
207-287-1600
SAID Item No.: 715 Topic(s):Laws and RegulationsSub-topic(s): State Laws and Regulations Summary of Law(s) and Regulation(s):
There is a comprehensive statute which governs workplace drug testing in Maine. There are restrictions on all types of testing and specific requirements that must be met with regard to drug testing procedures. All substance abuse programs must be approved by the Maine Department of Labor. Prior to conducting any type of drug testing, the employer must provide an employee assistance program or participate in an EAP consortium. Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. Tit. 26, 681-690 (Supp. 2005) [note: to see sequential sections of the Code, change the number at the end of the URL in your browser address field]  Title 26, §681: Purpose; applicability  The State Employment Practices Law regarding testing for substance abuse among temporary workers was amended. The use of consent forms is prohibited. An employer may not require, request, or suggest that any employee or applicant for employment sign or agree to any form or agreement that attempts to (1) absolve the employer from any liability that may arise out of the imposition of the substance abuse test or (2) waive an employee's or applicant's rights, or eliminate or diminish an employer's obligation, under the State Revised Statutes Annotated, except as provided by State statute. An employment agency, as defined by State statute, may request a written waiver for a temporary placement from an individual already in its employ or on a roster of eligibility, as long as the client company has an approved substance abuse testing policy and the individual has not been assigned work at the client company in the 30 days previous to the request. The test must otherwise comply with both State standards and the employment agency's approved policy regarding applicant testing. The agency may not take adverse action against the individual for refusal to sign a waiver.

 

every state varies, several states do not permit workplace drug testing under their own constitution's right to privacy of the individual....Mass might be one of them....?
 
 
This law is designed not to punish, but weed out the users and abusers of the system. The theory being, if you have money to support a drug habit, you have money to pay your bills and feed your children, and the tax payers don't wanna support your lazy stoned behind.

The flaw in the law is that it is not mandatory and they expect recipients to pay for it. Make it mandatory and free if the idea is to truly weed out the slackers. Make it as impossible as feasible for them to get around the test, even if it means having a medical attendant watch them piss. Make it as uncomfortable as possible for them to get over on the system. Anyone who truly needs the assistance, does not have a drug habit, has an ounce of self respect for him/herself, and wants better for his/her family, would not mind taking the test.
 
 
nothing like proving ur innocent before trying u to be found guilty. Love that totalanistic viewpoint u freedom loving, smaller government intrusionist people

and who's gonna pay for all that big gvt?

and if the idea is that it is your money paying for their welfare and the illegal drugs makes them scummy lazy bastards then why aren't you testing them for alcohol or the pharmaceuticals they could be taking in mass?

and it's simply untrue that the innocent people don't mind doing this kind of testing....i don't do drugs but i have always been against workplace drug testing, and the states i have lived in as of late, don't support the privacy invasion either. of drug testing.

If the first month is any sign, 16,000 people did not pick up $300.00 checks. If that continued for the year, and they found that they did not want those checks, Florida just decreased their entitlement outlay $57 million annually.

Did I recall accurately that almost 50% of our citizens are on some kind of entitlement?

ENTITLEMENT NATION: NOW 50% OF AMERICANS RECEIVE GOVERNMENT BENEFITS
Published 09/17/2010 - 11:54 a.m. CST

 
The Wall Street Journal today is reporting that for the first time in history nearly half of all Americans receive some form of government benefits.The percentage of U.S. households that do not pay into federal income taxes has also grown to 45% this year. That number is up from 39% just five year ago, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan organization.

The WSJ reports that Keith Hennessey an economic advisor to President George W. Bush said, "We have a very large share of the American population that is getting checks from the government and an increasingly smaller portion of the population that's paying for it."

The article goes on to report, “The dimensions of the budget hole were underscored Monday, when the Treasury reported that the government ran a $1.26 trillion deficit for the first 11 months of the fiscal year, on pace to be the second-biggest on record.”

It's amusing to see day after day, month after month, year after year, post after post, thread after thread, by the right wing nuts about freedom....

...yet in this instance, they want testing.

Funny thing is, I agree with the premise...if you have enough money to buy drugs or alcohol, why are my tax dollars supporting you?
 
 
No alcohol and prescription drugs are cool to abuse because if you have money for those but no food, you deserve the help.

If this was about being lazy, or spending money on drugs instead of food, you'd hear repubs push for those tests too.
 
 
 
I take it you have never heard of a field sobriety test. You want to drive... they have the right to test you. However you have a good point... drug testing should be required for all drivers licenses.

Sure it it permissible. The requirements of receiving a check are a clean drug test... no one is forcing them to test. [/COLOR]

 

I take it you missed the part of the constitution that requires reasonable cause for a search to be permissible. Field sobriety tests cannot be administered at any time for any reason. And officer must develop a reasonable suspicion that a person is driving intoxicated in order to administer one. And even then, the person has the right to refuse the test.

But this drug testing is entirely different from that. It requires the test absent any reasonable cause to suspect that the person is going to use their benefits to buy drugs. Simply applying for government assistance is not sufficient to presume a person is going to use the assistance for illegal activity. Furthermore, the requirement does not actually serve a legitimate government interest, which is a necessary element to justify an infringement upon a person's 4th amendment rights.

I, too, agree that it's reasonable to want entitlement funding to be used responsibly. This scenario just goes to show the danger of taking extreme stances over otherwise good ideas. By holding onto the extreme, the right only invites backlash and partisan bickering that slows progress.
 
 
So 1500+ refused testing? You can bet your last welfare dollar that less than 10% of them refused so on principal. And anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that to be true.

It is not unconstitutional, nor is it an invasion of privacy, I've pissed in more bottles than I can remember. Especially in the military. But I also filled a few as terms of civilian employment.

If you truly need assistance, you will take the test or clean up and take the test. If you refuse you must not need the offered assistance. Move along and find someplace else to run your scam.

If you are an addict there are hundreds of programs you can enroll in voluntarily. I'll bet if you really needed assistance for food, shelter, or clothing, then you would register and dry out in order to get it. I bet the state will even assist you........

Of course many simply do not want to stop taking their drugs. The real world scares the piss out of them....
 
 
Dr. Grump,

First of all I like your post and want you to know that. But I have a qualm with this:

"You know, the one thing that peeves me about Obama haters and neocons in general is that they live on sound bites. There is no substance to their argument. They think a throw away sentence from the likes of Beck, Rush, Hannity or O'Reilly is some intriguing insight, when all it is is a partisan, insipid few words with no hard data or research to back them up." Me

"Obama haters annd neocons." I never really understood the term neocon so I will simply admit my stupidity on that. But would like you to define "Obama hater" for me. I would not vote for the president for I think he has been a failure and we cannot take any more time with his agenda and administration than we have to. Does the make me an Obama hater? I think he is a lovely man and would welcome him and family as neighbors. Just not the leader of our country.

So I would assume I am bunched in with an entire group of people that have no substance to my arguments, use throw away sentences I've heard from conservatives with no hard data to back my thoughts or arguments.

No you didn't say this, but I am left to assume, that those who's arguments you agree with, you have no problems with their arguments and you see no faults with their limited language skills, data and and sometimes less than thought out issues, as exemplified by the OWS.

I'm just thinking that this bias you have may actually be more on target on an individual basis rather than a group of people and on both sides of the aisle..
 
 
 
Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

 
MIAMI  State figures show that hundreds of welfare applicants in Florida have declined to take drug tests that have been required for the assistance since mid-July.
Thirty-two applicants failed the test, 7,028 passed and 1,597 didnt take it, according figures released Tuesday the Department of Children and Families. People who decline to take the test arent required to explain.

Proponents of the law have suggested applicants would be deterred because they knew they would test positive. Critics say applicants may not have taken the test because they couldnt afford the fee that can be as much as $35 or didnt have easy access to a testing facility.

 

Not sure how I feel about this.

 

What's the point if they aren't required to take the test? Let the government pay for it, but make them all take it, and they should become ineligable for welfare if they test positive.
 
 
 
This law is designed not to punish, but weed out the users and abusers of the system. The theory being, if you have money to support a drug habit, you have money to pay your bills and feed your children, and the tax payers don't wanna support your lazy stoned behind.

 

The punishment is that innocent people are being forced to surrender their constitutional rights to privacy for the sake of uncovering the wrong doing of others. This is the very antithesis of American concepts of freedom and our constitutional protections.
 
 
If you want entitlements spent responsibly sounds like you want someone to check on that, expanding govt. Drug testing doesn't have shit to do with spending entitlements responsibly.
 
 
 
This is tax payer money intended to help people in need to feed, clothes and provide shelter for themselves and their children.

 

And what of corporate welfare to the oil industry? This is tax payer money intended to help an industry that is vital to the public good and economy remain sustainable and viable. Should we invoke drug testing of every employee and invested in oil companies, to make sure that they're not using the portion of their paychecks that comes from government subsidies on things like drugs? If you say no, then the same argument is not valid on individual welfare.
 
 
 
 
Society has every right to demand limits be set when they are footing the bill. The moochers should be thankful.

 

The constitution also prohibits unreasonable searches. Also, if you feel this way, why are you opposed to my suggestion for STD testing to ensure that food stamps aren't being used to buy prostitutes?

 

I hate to break it to you, but prostitutes aren't the only ones you get STDs from.
 
 
 
So 1500+ refused testing? You can bet your last welfare dollar that less than 10% of them refused so on principal. And anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that to be true.

It is not unconstitutional, nor is it an invasion of privacy, I've pissed in more bottles than I can remember. Especially in the military. But I also filled a few as terms of civilian employment.

If you truly need assistance, you will take the test or clean up and take the test. If you refuse you must not need the offered assistance. Move along and find someplace else to run your scam.

If you are an addict there are hundreds of programs you can enroll in voluntarily. I'll bet if you really needed assistance for food, shelter, or clothing, then you would register and dry out in order to get it. I bet the state will even assist you........

Of course many simply do not want to stop taking their drugs. The real world scares the piss out of them....

 

in many cases, here in maine, it is against the state laws to drug test....for right to privacy reasons....i posted this earlier....then again, mainers are a breed of their own...my state even refused to adhere to the federal gvt's push to make certain our driver's licenses comply with homeland security measures.

people seem to forget we live in a Republic, and States Rule.

any federal gvt requirement for drug testing truck drivers of hazardous wastes or things like that are met by the state, but not without resistance.

obviously, floridians don't have the same state constitution or rights or limited gvt powers that we do up here in maine, but you can bet your bottom dollar that this will be challenged in the courts, even there!.

so that's it? that's all you are going to require from them to prove they are spending it responsibly? just a drug test? not an alcohol use test, or a going to McDonalds too many times a week test? Or a: are you looking for a job with your gas money spent test?

i guess you DO believe in small gvt!!!!

States rights are a good thing. And yes I expect it will be tried in the courts, but I don't think it will be overturned. I would vote for it myself if it came to that here in Ohio.

if we didn't have a constitution that proctected us from that gvt over reach, i'd personally be for it too, i think???  
 
 
 
Not sure how I feel about this.

 

If we had 4.4 percent unemployment and a booming housing market this wouldnt even be an issue.

Otherwise its a violation of the 4th Amendment; its a presumption of guilt, as the state can provide no compelling interest to test those applying for benefits nor is there any evidence applicants for public assistance are more prone to use illegal drugs than the general population.

 
Pure harassment? lol nobody is forcing them to take the hand out... to call this harassment is either not knowing what harassment is or just straight diluted thinking.

 

 
I don't think welfare is a constitutionally guaranteed right so the state has the ability to hold recipients to whatever criteria they please.

 

The Court struck down as un-Constitutional a Georgia law requiring drug testing of state officials:

 
Our precedents establish that the proffered special need for drug testing must be substantial--important enough to override the individual's acknowledged privacy interest, sufficiently vital to suppress the Fourth Amendment's normal requirement of individualized suspicion Georgia has failed to showa special need of that kind.

 Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997) 

 

That will be the case for Florida as well, as testing public assistance applicants has even less merit than the Georgia statue.

 
I'm quite certain the state of Fla. has the capacity to decide if their laws work for the state of Fla. We don't need you doofus to decide. Like I said. spend your drug money on food, test clean and if you still need help.. well then we'll take your applications.

 

Fortunately Florida is subject to the US Constitution, and whether or not ones rights are violated is not determined by the majority.

A drug test doesnt show if welfare is being spent outside of it's intent, try again ACE.
 
 
 
What is a drug test going to prove? and why is it relevant to receiving welfare? If you're on drugs your kids dont have hunger?

 

If you have money for drugs, you have money for food for your kids and don't need welfare.
 
 
 
 
 
False.

As an overall percentage, very few companies do pre-employment drug tests. And of those, even fewer do random drug tests.

 

You just make shit up, doncha?

{Drug testing, legally required for many public employers, has become widespread in the private sector over the past two decades. A 2006 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management found that 84 percent of employers required new hires to pass drug screenings, and 39 percent randomly tested employees after they were hired. In addition, 73 percent tested workers when drug use was suspected and 58 percent required testing after accidents on the job.}

 Job Applicant? Expect a Drug Test | TheLedger.com 

 

Interesting claim to be sure. But I wish they would've given more detail about the actual survey since it conflicts with everything I've ever read. I've yet to be given an employment drug test, nor do I know anyone personally that has ever had to take one.

 

I'm guessing you haven't changed jobs in the past 10 years, or known anyone that has. Everyone I've ever applied to in the last 10 years has required a drug test.

it all depends on which state you live in....

my state limits workplace drug testing based on our right to privacy....his state does the same, i presume? While your state does not protect it....i presume again! i lived in his state and worked there several years, and my hubby had 4 different jobs in the 9 years living there, not one was drug tested....

like i said earlier, it depends on the state you live in.
 
 
Come on folks, let us get in the REAL WORLD.
You work for a professional organization and there is a top salesman from another entity that is not happy with his deal with the company he is with. Another competitor in this high tech or high WHATEVER company could use this gun that is a closer and a deal maker.
And the competitor that lands this guy is YOUR COMPANY.
After the legal matters involving any covenant not to compete agreements either implied or in writing are disposed of, the young gun is let go and he/she brings in 1.5 mil in business the first year.
Sometime after that, before the deal was done, after half the deals were done, half past the hair on the elbow OR WTF, the business '"finds out" the hot shot has/"had" a drug problem. Snorts, runs it, eats it, inhales it, crams it up their ass. His client list has expanded and his sales are estimated at 2.1 mil in 2012. Or more.
Does this individual EVER get drug tested?
Remember, we are talking REAL WORLD here.
Or does a team of experts including the intelligence that was hired since this dude was hired to cover his actions and report, advise management NOT to drug test and let everyone know?
Not saying this is right but this is what HAS been done for the last 40 years.
And it will NEVER change.
Real world.
 
 
 
 
Should
Doctors
Nurses
Bus Drivers
Teachers
Firemen
Policemen
Be drug tested?

 

Most jobs have mandatory drug testing to get the job and then random drug testing during the year

 

most jobs WHERE? Not in my state, nor the previous state that I lived in....

maybe in your state this is the case, but each state has their own laws and protections on this....
 
 
 
 
The searches are voluntary.

People consent to the search as part of the process of applying for government hand outs.

No one is being forced against their will to apply for a hand out.

 

And as we've already addressed, that's as good as saying that the police have a right to require you to take a drug test before you can report a crime. Nobody is forcing you to report the crime.

 

Not the same at all.

Using government service is not at all the same as receiving a government check
 
 
 
 
 
No one wants to address who the welfare benefits?

Drug users are bad but a drug users kid has nothing to do with it.

 

Then the kids can be removed from the drug addicts care as they should be anyway.

 

who's gonna fund that? and shouldn't that be up to a social worker whether a child gets removed from the family?

the point is that you want to treat many many many many innocent, drug free people as if they were criminals, just because some of your taxes, very very very very little of those taxes btw, goes towards welfare for them.

that's bull crud from the get go.

 

Funding it isn't the issue. I have no problem with the government removing kids from an unsafe household.

We get treated like criminals by the fucking government all the time when we don't want a tax payer funded hand out and I don't care how little of my taxes go to welfare as long as what taxes do aren't used for some losers drug habit.
 
 
 
It sound's like some people presume that if you apply for public assistance for your family you are a "mooch, criminal, drug user"....etc etc etc.

Some of you want to punish the poor for being poor. What else is new?

 

Not at all by screening out the druggies there will be more money for those that are law abiding.
 
 
 
 
 
No one wants to address who the welfare benefits?

So it's better to leave kids in the care of drug addicts who use public money to get high?
 
 
 
Not the same at all.

Using government service is not at all the same as receiving a government check

 

Wow, that was stupid!! They're they exact same thing!!!      
 
 
A welfare fuck refusing to take a drug test is like a person refusing to pay for their cheeseburger at burger king...

The cheeseburger ISNT a right and neither is welfare - especially when you're a 3rd generation welfare recipient...

They want the taxpayers to fund them for free yet they think it's out of line if the taxpayers have expectations of them????

I'm a libertarian to boot....

You want the taxpayers to fund you - guess what? prove you're not a crack head and we can talk...

You know what this proves tho??? most welfare fucks are on drugs and use taxpayer money to BUY DRUGS...

I have no problem with drugs or those who like to smoke a little weed as a sleep sedative - but these motherfuckers are expecting taxpayers to fund their drug habit and when questioned they're telling the taxpayers to fuckoff..... It's your responsibility to buy them their crack rocks, their heroin and their ice...

Of course progressives are like "yes we will, yes we will, yes we will, yes we will"

Of course they will deny it but yet it's happening right in front of their faces..

Let me guess liberals will respond with nothing more than a 4 line sentence regarding their support for such evildoing.
 
 
 
 
This law is designed not to punish, but weed out the users and abusers of the system. The theory being, if you have money to support a drug habit, you have money to pay your bills and feed your children, and the tax payers don't wanna support your lazy stoned behind.

The flaw in the law is that it is not mandatory and they expect recipients to pay for it. Make it mandatory and free if the idea is to truly weed out the slackers. Make it as impossible as feasible for them to get around the test, even if it means having a medical attendant watch them piss. Make it as uncomfortable as possible for them to get over on the system. Anyone who truly needs the assistance, does not have a drug habit, has an ounce of self respect for him/herself, and wants better for his/her family, would not mind taking the test.

 

and who's gonna pay for all that big gvt?

and if the idea is that it is your money paying for their welfare and the illegal drugs makes them scummy lazy bastards then why aren't you testing them for alcohol or the pharmaceuticals they could be taking in mass?

and it's simply untrue that the innocent people don't mind doing this kind of testing....i don't do drugs but i have always been against workplace drug testing, and the states i have lived in as of late, don't support the privacy invasion either. of drug testing.

 

Well, if a one-time payment for a drug test turns up positive for one being on drugs, then it is a lot more cost effective than continued taxpayer support of their drug habit. I believe pharmaceuticals, at least some of them, would also turn up in the test. As far alcohol...that may come next next, but this is a good place to start.

Work place drug testing keeps folks safe, not only the employees themselves, but fellow employees, and consumers of their products as well, if it is service industry, and insures that the products or services they produce met quality standards and are not being performed/provided by someone who is impaired. Somewhere along the line, folks on the job have proven that drug testing is a necessity and the honor system no longer is effective.

Interesting how folks parade out 'their rights' to justify wrong doing. I'm sick to death of folks pulling this crap and stretching the true meaning of their rights all out of proportion to justify moronic acts, that in this case, are just a drain on the entire society.

I know of what I speak. I know for certain there are folks receiving this assistance who do nothing to better their situation except come up with more creative ways to get over on the system. I'm all for folks receiving this assistance who truy need it, but one must also be held accountable for their own situation and move toward getting off the assistance.

Aside from that, drug usage is illegal. I don't know how folks reason with themselves that it is okay to rape the system to enable their illegal activities. What kind of example are they to their kids?

Wow, that was stupid!! They're they exact same thing!!!

Using a government service is done as you live your life.
Receiving a government check is a way of life.

Well, I have hired and fired hundreds of people over my career, and not once did I ever have to or need to have them drug tested to keep them under my hire or to fire them. All that was done under my direction/management, was done due to their quality of work.

It's naive to believe that drug testing only, can make your workplace safe.

Good on hand management, makes your workplace safe...with or without drug testing.

It's an invasion of privacy....and I will never, ever change my mind on this....

there are exceptions to my rule of not drug testing in the workplace and that is when employees are doing a dangerous job....and or if there has been an accident in the workplace.....

as I had mentioned earlier, in the corporations that I have worked for, there was no drug testing for any of our employees except the employees that worked in our distribution center, where heavy lifting and machinery to move the goods was or could be, dangerous.

In Maine, workplace drug testing is very, very limited and very controlled with rules and regs that restrict this practice by the gvt if they do.....because my state believes it breaks the constitutions right to privacy.

Florida, has their own rules and obviously does not believe it breaks privacy rights.....

welfare drug testing WILL have its day in court.....we will see how it comes out.

Yeppers, reckon we will have to agree to disagree with this issue. I never contended that drug testing alone will insure a safe workplace, but obviously employees themselves proved there was a need for some kind of accountability. You are citing specific instances...I'm speaking about the system as a whole and how it effects all of our lives. I do not think anyone's right to privacy was meant to emcompass enabling them to rape taxpayers and engage in illegal activities, and they are not only taking advantage of the system, but their rights as well, are fully aware of it, and counting on folks like you to plead their case for them.

I know of what I speak. I know for certain there are folks receiving this assistance who do nothing to better their situation except come up with more creative ways to get over on the system. I'm all for folks receiving this assistance who truy need it, but one must also be held accountable for their own situation and move toward getting off the assistance.

Aside from that, drug usage is illegal. I don't know how folks reason with themselves that it is okay to rape the system to enable their illegal activities. What kind of example are they to their kids?

 

Well, I have hired and fired hundreds of people over my career, and not once did I ever have to or need to have them drug tested to keep them under my hire or to fire them. All that was done under my direction/management, was done due to their quality of work.

It's naive to believe that drug testing only, can make your workplace safe.

Good on hand management, makes your workplace safe...with or without drug testing.

It's an invasion of privacy....and I will never, ever change my mind on this....

there are exceptions to my rule of not drug testing in the workplace and that is when employees are doing a dangerous job....and or if there has been an accident in the workplace.....

as I had mentioned earlier, in the corporations that I have worked for, there was no drug testing for any of our employees except the employees that worked in our distribution center, where heavy lifting and machinery to move the goods was or could be, dangerous.

In Maine, workplace drug testing is very, very limited and very controlled with rules and regs that restrict this practice by the gvt if they do.....because my state believes it breaks the constitutions right to privacy.

Florida, has their own rules and obviously does not believe it breaks privacy rights.....

welfare drug testing WILL have its day in court.....we will see how it comes out.

 

I am not sure why you see drug testing for welfare as anm invasion of privacy.
No one is making them take welfare and thus no one is making them take a drug test.

Is it invasion of privacy when an automobile insurer seeks out your driving record?
Is it invasion of privacy when a lending institution wants to see your w-2's?

No....as it is necessary information for those two entities to efficiently service you.

Likewise, the government has the respoinsibility to service the taxpayer and ensure the tax money is being spent wisely.

Let me ask you this....if you donated money to a charity and you found out that charity was not what they claimed, but instead was using the money to enable drug users to purchase drugs....would you continue donating to that charity?

Well...doesnt the taxpayer have the right to knowing where their money is actually going?
 
 
 
 
 
and who's gonna pay for all that big gvt?

and if the idea is that it is your money paying for their welfare and the illegal drugs makes them scummy lazy bastards then why aren't you testing them for alcohol or the pharmaceuticals they could be taking in mass?

and it's simply untrue that the innocent people don't mind doing this kind of testing....i don't do drugs but i have always been against workplace drug testing, and the states i have lived in as of late, don't support the privacy invasion either. of drug testing.

 

Well, if a one-time payment for a drug test turns up positive for one being on drugs, then it is a lot more cost effective than continued taxpayer support of their drug habit. I believe pharmaceuticals, at least some of them, would also turn up in the test. As far alcohol...that may come next next, but this is a good place to start.

Work place drug testing keeps folks safe, not only the employees themselves, but fellow employees, and consumers of their products as well, if it is service industry, and insures that the products or services they produce met quality standards and are not being performed/provided by someone who is impaired. Somewhere along the line, folks on the job have proven that drug testing is a necessity and the honor system no longer is effective.

you speak of safety in the workplace as a viable reason and I agree...

But that is referring to just physical safety.

What about safety as it pertains to the company?

What if an employee is so strung out he/she deos something that costs the company its licensee to operate?
Or costs the company thousands of dollars putting them under...and the employees out of jobs?
Or steals from the company to support his/her habit?

No one forces an employee to take a drug test. The person has a right to not take the job.

And companies that initiated drug testing here in NY?

All of my clients grandfathered existing employees as that would have been inappropriate....they are simply tests for those that opt to take a job there.
 
 
The politicians steal more $$ than the welfare cheats. Local patronage in your county and municipality wastes more cash. Does anyone believe they will ever drug test all of those folks?
Drug testing is a joke. Drugs are A HEALTH PROBLEM.
Smokers cause more damage to society than dope heads. Will they test for tobacco use?
Add on the unreliability of 95% of these drug tests as you can mask weed and other dope and they are about useless. Hair follicle tests are expensive as hell. State and Fed crime labs are backed up as it is now so who will do these tests and where is the $$$?
As usual, a well intentioned idea that has no basis in reality.

I agree. But as I pointed out earlier the top gun sales guy or top exec will be allowed to snort all the dope he wants in most cases. They will be advised to hide it and get them help, not test them or fire them.
OK with me to allow businesses to make what ever requirements they want.
But if the idea is to equally apply a drug testing requirement in most companies, believe me as I have seen it first hand for 30 years, it is never done with the big boys. Profits come first. Not saying that is wrong.

I must disagree.

Anyone at any level that I have hired through my recruiting efforts must have a drug test to get hired if the company (my client) drug tests.

As for intermitent drug testing once you are employed.......HR laws make it very difficult to do as you say. All you need is one disgruntled employee who leaves to whistle blow and it could put you out of business.

good management solves all of those problems Jarhead...if there was an employee that was so strung out that they could not do their job without harming the company, SURELY this can be spotted by the Director or Manager before it gets out of hand, and the employee would be let go....

Hello? What in the world did us business people do before drug tests were even available?????? We managed our staffs.

this is how I feel:

 
If you dont use drugs, you have nothing to hide  so why object to testing?

Drug testing allows employers to intrude upon the private lives of their employees. The right to be left alone is, in the words of the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men. Both the actual taking of urine samples and the analysis of the sample, which may disclose private information, violate this right to be left alone.

As stated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, there are few activities in our society more personal or private than the passing of urine.4 The drug testing process subjects individuals to an offensive and degrading process. Some employers even require the employee to strip and urinate into a cup in the presence of an observer in order to prevent cheating.

In addition, analysis of a persons urine can disclose many details about that persons private life other than drug use, including personal medical information. It can tell an employer whether an employee or job applicant is being treated for a heart condition, depression, epilepsy or diabetes. It can also reveal whether an employee is pregnant. Drug testing may provide employers with a periscope through which they can peer into an individuals behavior in her private life, even in her own home....5 For all of these reasons, the Supreme Court has found that urine testing, like blood testing, constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment.6

 

please read this link, it expresses many of my concerns.....

 DRUG TESTING IN THE WORKPLACE 

in addition to this, the gvt has high guidelines that they must follow on testing an employee, more so than a private sector employer....it is the GVT that is drug testing recipients of welfare....there is no workplace hazard risk.....

as i said, we will see what happens in the court on this..
 
 
 
A welfare fuck refusing to take a drug test is like a person refusing to pay for their cheeseburger at burger king...

 

  That is, by far, the dumbest thing yet said in this entire thread. There is absolutely no logical compatibility to the two situations, other than the fact that you just don't like either one.

 
The cheeseburger ISNT a right and neither is welfare

 

Until you can show me a statute that says that people qualify for free Burger King cheeseburgers based on low income, leave the fast food out of this.

 
especially when you're a 3rd generation welfare recipient...

 

So what you're saying is that we should condemn people for the inadequacies of society. Well, at least we're not engaging in class warfare.  

 
They want the taxpayers to fund them for free yet they think it's out of line if the taxpayers have expectations of them????

 

You know, when I was a kid I expected my parents to provide me with food, housing, clothing, and pretty much all my needs and a great many of my wants. I expected to pay nothing for this. But never once would I, or anyone of a sane mind, think that this would give my parents a right to invade the privacy and sanctity of my body.

 
I'm a libertarian to boot....

 

You say that as if it were a good thing. But really, it ranks right up there with saying "I'm a socialist to boot."

 
You want the taxpayers to fund you - guess what? prove you're not a crack head and we can talk.

 

Why do you hate the constitution so much? The constitution clearly protects a person from baseless searches by the government. The simple fact that you dislike entitlement programs, and you hate poor people, and are completely biased against anyone who doesn't make at least a certain amount of money, and want to engage in class warfare, does not give you grounds to simply dismiss people's constitutional rights just because you want it to.

 
You know what this proves tho??? most welfare fucks are on drugs and use taxpayer money to BUY DRUGS...

 

This proves that you are irrationally prejudiced, a class warfare participant, and are devoid of any logical basis for your arguments here. There is nothing here that proves anything more than a small minority of FLORIDA (and only Florida) welfare recipients did use some kind of drug relatively recently before applying (32 out of 7028 = 0.005%). Nothing proves that their use was part of a repetitive or regular habit, that they spent any money on those drugs, or that they spent any welfare funds on those drugs. Nothing here proves even a single instance of drug usage occurred among those who did not take the test. Nothing here definitively establishes a reason why those people declined to take the test, though the article did suggest that many of them may have had difficulties paying for the test or obtaining travel.

Thus, based on all available information, 0.005% of Floridians applying for welfare seem to be potential drug users, though we don't know how they finance those drugs. And from this, you conclude that "most" recipients are habitual drug users and that they are using welfare funds.  

 
I have no problem with drugs or those who like to smoke a little weed as a sleep sedative - but these motherfuckers are expecting taxpayers to fund their drug habit and when questioned they're telling the taxpayers to fuckoff

 

What is with your blatant hostility toward the poor? What's the problem, are you jealous that they have something you don't?

 
It's your responsibility to buy them their crack rocks, their heroin and their ice.

 

Citation needed. Unless you can prove what drugs those 32 people tested positive for, stop saying this shit.

 
Of course progressives are like "yes we will, yes we will, yes we will, yes we will"

 

And wing-nut conservatives like you are saying "yes we will....engage in class warfare without regret, but then bitch that anyone who disagrees with us is committing an evil of engaging in class warfare. It's this kind of idiocy that got Obama elected and will keep him in office.

 
Of course they will deny it but yet it's happening right in front of their faces.

 

Again, prove it. The only thing that we have here is that 0.005% percent of Floridians who APPLY for benefits use drugs recently before applying. This is an incredibly small amount as it is, and there is nothing to suggest that they used welfare funds to pay for those drugs. After all, they didn't have welfare funds at the time because they're applying now.

 
Let me guess liberals will respond with nothing more than a 4 line sentence regarding their support for such evildoing.

 

I think that I'd prefer their 4 lines to your irrational, angry tirade. But whatever they do, maybe you can chew on this reply for a while. But let me guess, you're going to respond with noting more than a 10 page spewing of hate and ignorance that basically amounts to "I want things a certain way so give it to me now, dammit!"
 
 
 
Using a government service is done as you live your life.
Receiving a government check is a way of life.

 

In other words, because YOU don't like entitlement spending, you're going to label it negatively and engage in class warfare, and expect people to embrace your emotionally drawn lines of distinction based on a need and desire to distinguish between the services you deem acceptable to receive and the services you deem unacceptable to receive.

Nice try but you dont know me nor my sentiments or you would not have...well....ranted as you did.

There are three different people in my eyes.

Those that can and do
Those that can but dont
Those that cant

Those that can and do get to live their lives as they please and in return pay taxes so those that cant get to enjoy as much of life as possible. They are forced into a way of life that is not necessarily the way they prefer, but they are happy to be able to move forward and I am glad that we, as Americans, have systems in place to help them oput. I see drug testing as an inconvenience for them, but a necessary one to weed out the next group...

.....Those that can but dont.
They have opted to have the way they live their lives dictated to them..and thus why I have no issue making them take drug tests to get their free stuff. If anything, we should blame this group for the instiutution of drug testing for welfare assistance.
 
 
 
The politicians steal more $$ than the welfare cheats. Local patronage in your county and municipality wastes more cash. Does anyone believe they will ever drug test all of those folks?

As usual, a well intentioned idea that has no basis in reality.

 

Smoking is legal, drug use is not. Drugs are a societal problem.. effects health of those who use and the health and welfare of children exposed and it exposes all of us to potential dangers of employees performing jobs who are impaired, as well as exposes all of us to the sometimes acts of violence, theft, personal injury, etc., coming from folks who cannot support their habits.

Explain to us again why hard working taxpaying American citizens should be forced to subsidize drug use?
 
 
I don't get it, getting drug abusers off the dependency of assistance is a win-win, for them and all of us paying to support their habit. It forces them to clean up their act...or suffer the consequences, and helps keep the rest of us being so taxation-poor paying for their continued habit and illegal activity.
No one's right to privacy cancels out your duty as a citizen to be a productive and vital asset your life, your country and a parent to provide YOUR kids with the best YOU are able to provide for them. That's the problem, folks expecting a free ride and when it is challenged they parade out their rights...give me a break.

or we can look at it this way...

if I found out a charity I give to annually is using the funds to buy drugs for drug users, I woiuld stop donating to them as such was not what I entrusted tghem to do with the money I give to them.

Well, as a taxpayer, it has been brought to my attention that a small percentage of welfare recipients are using the money to either buy drugs, or to replace other money they had and bought drugs with..

I would like this action with the money I give to the government to stop as it is not what I entrust the governemnt to do with the money I give to them.

So how can we get it to stop?

Or do those against the "drug testing" not want it to stop?

The government is not obligated to give anyone free money for the asking.

People requesting a hand out must prove their income is low enough that they cannot provide adequate food, clothing or shelter for them or their family.

If the government finds the person requesting help has been spending money on illegal drugs instead of providing the necessities, they no longer are obligated to help fund them as they have demonstrated they have enough money for their needs in addtions to drugs.

Is not biases or politics. It's common sense. Some people have it and some just don't. Perhaps its a result of the drugs.
 
 
 
 
Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

 
MIAMI  State figures show that hundreds of welfare applicants in Florida have declined to take drug tests that have been required for the assistance since mid-July.
Thirty-two applicants failed the test, 7,028 passed and 1,597 didnt take it, according figures released Tuesday the Department of Children and Families. People who decline to take the test arent required to explain.

Proponents of the law have suggested applicants would be deterred because they knew they would test positive. Critics say applicants may not have taken the test because they couldnt afford the fee that can be as much as $35 or didnt have easy access to a testing facility.

 

Not sure how I feel about this.

 

are they doing alcohol testing, too?

either way... are you going to starve people for smoking a joint? pure harassment, imo.

 

So.....are you OK with your tax dollars feeding someone else's "weed" habit?

And then you would have to ask yourself why, 'cause for me the ol' right to privacy thing does not fly, just like with freedom of speech, it's true meaning and intent is being stretched far beyond it's original intent to justify idiocy, not to mention illegal and immoral activities.
 
 
 
This is the thing, the fact that they are "voluntarily" applying does not magically make the REQUIRED search constitutionally permissible.

 

I'll tell you what, Onthefarleft; next time you are in an airport, refuse to go through the metal detector and use that argument.

Get back to us with the results.

 
That would be like saying that since you choose to drive a car, the government can stop you any time they want and search you and your car. Yes, you choose to drive. But that does not mean the government can simply adopt requirements attached to it that will force you to forsake your constitutionally protected privacy.

Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

Not sure how I feel about this.

 

 
are they doing alcohol testing, too?

either way... are you going to starve people for smoking a joint? pure harassment, imo.

 

Ha, this is nieve...these folks are much more resourceful than you give them credit. Besides government assistance, food stamps, etc., there are food banks all across the nation where they can get free food and househould items and believe me, they know where to locate them and how to even deceive those programs. They are not going to starve, but perhaps they might starting paying for their own life if forced to stop abusing drugs and the system.

Doctors

Be drug tested?

 

Most jobs have mandatory drug testing to get the job and then random drug testing during the year

 

most jobs WHERE? Not in my state, nor the previous state that I lived in....

maybe in your state this is the case, but each state has their own laws and protections on this....

 

I live in Washington state, what state do you live in?

I don't know what your food bank is like, but during our "3 years of hell" we didn't qualify for foodstamps and were forced to go to the local foodbank. Lot's of pastries and bread and very little of anything else. I never ate so many pastries in my life. On the other hand, I got to have bobboli pizza, something I can't afford now.
 
 
 
no it is not faulty, it is realistic...

AND AS THE RESULTS SHOW, you are not drug testing just drug users, you are drug testing thousands of innocent people.....

 

So?

When I took the job I have now, some 22 years ago, (not the teaching, I do that part time for fun.) I had to be drug tested. I didn't use drugs, but everyone had to test. Big deal, pee in a cup.

 
are you willing to allow the gvt to drug test you, just because you are taking a $1000 dollar child tax credit?

 

Tax credits are not welfare.

Try again.

 
Are you willing to allow the gvt to have you submit to a drug test because you are receiving a college grant?

 

Might be a good idea, a student on drugs won't generally do well in college.

 
Are you willing to have the gvt force corporate ceos to a drug test that received bail out money?

 

Yes, absolutely yes. Let's drug test Obama before he hands out the bail out money.

What do you figure his coke habit costs each month?

 
Where will it end?

Or are you just concerned with the poorest among us?

 

My employer is cruel and mean, they expect me to DO things, like get up really early and go to work, show up and NOT be hung over. It's an infringement on my rights..

Come on, nothing is without strings, nothing. Want free money? Then you have to submit to a drug test.

 
what's the purpose of the drug test?

 

To not have taxpayer money support the drug trade and enrich the cartels.

Why do you ask?

 
if you say they are getting your tax money...then so are alot of other people and entities, are you really willing to have our gvt drug test all of them monthly and pay for it?

 

No, a test with the application is sufficient.

 
it's bullcrud uncensored! It really is..

 

I support legalization of drugs, but with freedom comes responsibility.

So.....are you OK with your tax dollars feeding someone else's "weed" habit?

 

you see...that is where I sit on the fence. I respect how it may be intepreted as invasion of privacy for those that are not doing drugs but forced to collect welfare as they have no other means of survival.

But the thought that I am assisting someone in breaking the law and possibly killing themselves?

You know....using an analogy...

A lending intstitution who asks for my financial infomation is invading my privacy....but not in an effort to "invade my privacy" and not in an effort to see that I am telling them the truth on my application for a loan...but in an effort to weed out those that do not desrve the ploan or cannot afford the loan.

So, in essnece, the invasion of my privacy is designed for other people...but I have to deal with it....

I see the same thing with the drug testing for welfare recipients.

Quality is not a right, it's something you work to attain. You want better than pastries and bread, get off the drugs and your ass, and get a job.
 
 
 
 
Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

 
MIAMI  State figures show that hundreds of welfare applicants in Florida have declined to take drug tests that have been required for the assistance since mid-July.
Thirty-two applicants failed the test, 7,028 passed and 1,597 didnt take it, according figures released Tuesday the Department of Children and Families. People who decline to take the test arent required to explain.

Proponents of the law have suggested applicants would be deterred because they knew they would test positive. Critics say applicants may not have taken the test because they couldnt afford the fee that can be as much as $35 or didnt have easy access to a testing facility.

 

Not sure how I feel about this.

 

are they doing alcohol testing, too?

either way... are you going to starve people for smoking a joint? pure harassment, imo.

 

God forbid we actually teach people there are negative consequences to bad behavior. It isn't harassment at all. It's essentially saying if you're on welfare, money provided to you that was taken by force from someone else, you have an obligation to those people to not waste it by buying weed.

You and I know, although you pretend otherwise, that welfare cannot be traded for drugs. Ever seen a drug dealer take groceries?
 
 
 
The punishment is that innocent people are being forced to surrender their constitutional rights to privacy for the sake of uncovering the wrong doing of others. This is the very antithesis of American concepts of freedom and our constitutional protections.

 

Onthefarleft, are you equally incensed that government requires people to detail where they live, whom they live with, how much they earn, how much they have in the bank, who they have sex with, the results of the sex act, how much they spend on education, how much they invest with the failure to do so resulting in long prison terms?

You leftists always scream about privacy, yet the most glaring and intrusive invasion of privacy most of you would fight to the death to keep.

That is of course, the IRS 1040 form where every person must detail every intimate part of their life to the government.
 
 
 
corporate welfare to the oil industry? employees invested in oil industries making sure that they are using the portion that comes from gov't subsidies? Can't follow that. Think we are talking apples and oranges, friend. Out of my league, lol.

I donate to our local food bank. They want canned goods. I suspect the breads and pastry are donated by bakeries. But as an individual, they want canned and boxed foods. I usually buy a couple of cases of soup, canned chicken and such at Sam's and donate them. I'm sure this is because these foods keep well.

Actually, it is neither ours or theirs. It is money we earned and in turn paid to the government in return for UNDEFINED services.
I use the term undefined as it is not like FICA or UI that is defined for the purpose...and no, I dont want to get into the debate about FICA and how it is used  

But whether they have worked or not, they can still be eligible for welfare.....so to say it is THEIRS is not accurate.

They are entitled to it as American Citizens....but they did not earn the money nor did they pay for the service.

I will say this...and I will be blasted by my conservative friends on here.

I just completed my 2010 taxes (extension).

My Real estate taxes and my interest on Mortgage amounted ot over 31K...(I pay over 11K in real estate taxes)....add in the college tuition tax credit and my two kids, wife and me as dependants....

Heck.....My taxable income dropped by over 45K.

The system is not fair to those that can not afford a home.
 
 
 
hmmmmmmm....if you want the deduction it gives you.....  

 

There was a good reason that the founding fathers opposed direct taxation. Taxes MUST be anonymous to be fairly and evenly administered. If the taxpayer is known, favors will be bought, no way around it.

 
I don't have to tell them anything other than what we make....the home is paid for now, so there is no interest deduction for us so we no longer have the opportunity to have enough deductions for the long form....

 

Why should you have to reveal your personal finances to the central authority? And don't you have to tell them how many children you have (results of sex acts) and the status of those?

 
but yes, I do agree with you that this is intrusive....but it is not a "search" which a urine analysis is, according the courts....

truth is, you dont have to reveal anything but your income.
If you opt for the write offs, you must reveal other infomration such as how many dependants you have.

But that is purely an option....if you prefer not telling the IRS how many kids you have simply file with only you as a dependant.

Agreed. Yeah, welfare's intent was to be a temporary thing...but, there are countless individuals who have made it their way of life because they grew up in a household that also made it their way of life. Their main purpose in life is finding ways to beat the system and stay on it and they are experts at it. It's unfortunate they do not focus all that effort in some kind of training, education or actually looking for a job. I do also put a lot of the blame on the system itself. I don't think in it's inception they predicted the amount of fraid and abuse that occurs today and has for years, and they do not have adequate checks and balances in place to prevent it....but this does not justify those folks who are taking advantage of the system's short-comings... to my mind they're scum, living off the backs of working folks to support their way of life. They're cheating fellow Americans, and they're are making it difficult for those who truly need to get the assistance to do so without shame...that's beyond low and no way to justify it.

Likewise, we do not write off the car my wife uses for work she does for 1099 income. We do not feel the IRS has the right to know where she drives and what she does......and take your mind out of the gutter...what she does on the side is legit!

i don't think kids should be taken away from their parents and given to the state to support under most cases, especially if there is no drug abuse or abuse of any kind....i don't think being poor is a reason to take them from the parents nor do i think having an occasional drink or joint is a reason to take someones kids away....which you suggested earlier....

a drug urine test is not accurate 10% of the time and up to 30% of the time....it also does not tell you anything of importance....sure they could test positive if a workplace tested them on a monday and they had smoked a joint with a friend a week ago, but at the same time another employee could snort a gram of coke monday morning on his way to the office, and made to take a urine test, and it would come out negative, because the coke had not metabolized in their system....so the cokehead keeps his job, while stoned at work and the person who smoked 1 jay a week earlier on his own time off, who is straight as an ace while working loses his job, or welfare or kids according to you....

that's just not right.

and you have no proof that the pot head paid for such with their welfare, a friend could have shared one, and no proof that even the coke head in my example purchased his coke with welfare money either.....your presumptions is what i have a problem with....

and IF the parent on welfare IS TRULY a drug ADDICT, who is unrecoverable, and they are harming their kids, then yes....their kids should be taken away, by social services....and you DO NOT need to subject them to a drug test to see that their kids are being harmed....

I am a realist....if you were to take the kids away from all parents that have used an illegal drug, then there would not be enough orphanages to take care of them all....more than 50% of our country is estimated to have done illegal drugs at one time or another from the last thing i read on it...

i see it, as none of your business....or the gvt's business.

the government making a citizen who does not even work for them in a dangerous job, be subjected to this kind of search and seizure is unacceptable, and a gvt over reach imo....and it is like the gvt making them testify against themselves too imo...so that's a double whammie, breaking the 4th amendment and the 5th amendment, again, in my opinion.
 
 
 
There are three different people in my eyes.

 

Whoont, whoont, whoont. Nothing you've said there justifies the word games you are playing. All you're doing is "justifying" your prejudicial and hate filled class warfare mentality. Though you're doing a fool's job of it.
 
 
 
Explain to us again why hard working taxpaying American citizens should be forced to subsidize drug use?

 

Uhhh, no. I'm going to say no, I'm not going to explain that to you until you can prove that it's even happening on any meaningful scale. And class warfare rhetoric is not proof.

It's also a lack of liberty to toil your ass off all day then have to come home and hand over 30% of what you made so a drug user can abuse his children.

NO one to date on this thread has ever held a drug abusing welfare receipent responsible for the welfare of his or her child. that's what demonRats do.. they make the hard working taxpayer shoulder that responsibility and then whine about their loss of liberty.

No one's right to privacy cancels out your duty as a citizen to be a productive and vital asset your life, your country and a parent to provide YOUR kids with the best YOU are able to provide for them.

 

Eh, this is a novel concept, that people's constitutional rights are predicated on first fulfilling some kind of duty to society. It's also an asinine concept. Do you think that murderers are fulfilling whatever duty to society you would propose? Yet is someone commits murder they still retain their constitutional rights to privacy, among others.
 
 
 
The government is not obligated to give anyone free money for the asking.

People requesting a hand out must prove their income is low enough that they cannot provide adequate food, clothing or shelter for them or their family.

If the government finds the person requesting help has been spending money on illegal drugs instead of providing the necessities, they no longer are obligated to help fund them as they have demonstrated they have enough money for their needs in addtions to drugs.

Is not biases or politics. It's common sense. Some people have it and some just don't. Perhaps its a result of the drugs.

 

None of that tolerates the government invading people's constitutional rights to privacy. None of that gives rise to any reasonable cause to suspect any given individual of doing drugs or is going to use benefits to fund drug use.
 
 
 
 
Explain to us again why hard working taxpaying American citizens should be forced to subsidize drug use?

 

Uhhh, no. I'm going to say no, I'm not going to explain that to you until you can prove that it's even happening on any meaningful scale. And class warfare rhetoric is not proof.

 

what do you deem a meaningful scale?

If your tax dollars was responsible for one person being able to afford a fix...and that fix killed them.....and they left behind children......would it not bother you?

Now, dont get me wrong...the more we debate this, the more I understand your position...and that of Care4all...and the more I am leaning in that direction....

But if you gave money to a charity and you found out that the charity, on a very small scale, was using that money to buy drugs for some people...would you stop donating money to them?

Well, this is just insane...these folks aren't too concerned about their children in the first place or they wouldn't be doing drugs...and by providing this 'out' the system is it's own worst enemy, providing yet another avenue for abuse.

Truly, I don't get you're condoning folks taking from law abiding, hard working citizens, raising kids as impaired parents and condoning illegal activity. How does their right to that trump their right to not be subjected to drug testing?

 

i don't think kids should be taken away from their parents and given to the state to support under most cases, especially if there is no drug abuse or abuse of any kind....i don't think being poor is a reason to take them from the parents nor do i think having an occasional drink or joint is a reason to take someones kids away....which you suggested earlier....

a drug urine test is not accurate 10% of the time and up to 30% of the time....it also does not tell you anything of importance....sure they could test positive if a workplace tested them on a monday and they had smoked a joint with a friend a week ago, but at the same time another employee could snort a gram of coke monday morning on his way to the office, and made to take a urine test, and it would come out negative, because the coke had not metabolized in their system....so the cokehead keeps his job, while stoned at work and the person who smoked 1 jay a week earlier on his own time off, who is straight as an ace while working loses his job, or welfare or kids according to you....

that's just not right.

and you have no proof that the pot head paid for such with their welfare, a friend could have shared one, and no proof that even the coke head in my example purchased his coke with welfare money either.....your presumptions is what i have a problem with....

and IF the parent on welfare IS TRULY a drug ADDICT, who is unrecoverable, and they are harming their kids, then yes....their kids should be taken away, by social services....and you DO NOT need to subject them to a drug test to see that their kids are being harmed....

I am a realist....if you were to take the kids away from all parents that have used an illegal drug, then there would not be enough orphanages to take care of them all....more than 50% of our country is estimated to have done illegal drugs at one time or another from the last thing i read on it...

i see it, as none of your business....or the gvt's business.

the government making a citizen who does not even work for them in a dangerous job, be subjected to this kind of search and seizure is unacceptable, and a gvt over reach imo....and it is like the gvt making them testify against themselves too imo...so that's a double whammie, breaking the 4th amendment and the 5th amendment, again, in my opinion.

 

No one here has condoned or even mentioned talking kids away from their parents, and certainly not based on the fact that they are poor...that's a ridiculous conclusion you've come to on your own to justify your opinion. You are mixing apples and oranges here, but I will say, if you're doing drugs, absolutely you're kids deserve better, you have no right to subject your kids to the shortcomings as a parent that inevitably come as a result of being an impaired parent. If these parents are truly concerned about being separated from their children, they would not be engaging in illegal activities that put themselves in danger of being incarcerated and their kids being taken away to begin with.

I disagree, you do have to substantiate, at least on paper, they they are indeed using drugs, a mere accusation or hunch is not enough legally.

I also disgaree with your statistics, if the test was that inaccurate, it's implementation and continued use would be highly challengeable, subject to massive lawsuits, and in that case deemed ineffective and not used.

Government over reach is just another phrase folks use to justify being irresponsible morons. What about the rights of those folks who are paying for that lifestyle? Does your right to use drugs and rape of us our tax dollors override our rights to demand that you conduct yourself lawfully and do something to better your situation, or do you just expect us to bend over and just take it?

You wanna smoke a joint, use cocaine...be my guest, but do it with YOUR money and don't ask me to say hey, it's a-okay with me if you subject your kids to all the ramifications that come from it, not to mention sending a big fat message it's okay to be dishonest, irresponsible, and as long as your getting away with it, engage in illegal activities, while you get high, don't work and don't pay taxes...basically just a total waste of oxygen.

Care4all does not deserve the spin.

What she is saying is "liberty" trumps all.....she sees it as a loss of liberty

and it is.....but only if you OPT to take welfare.

So it is no more a loss of liberty than offering a lending institution your w-2 in an effort to get a loan.

 

It's also a lack of liberty to toil your ass off all day then have to come home and hand over 30% of what you made so a drug user can abuse his children. They just take what you have earned and then want to hold the children hostage. NO one to date on this thread has ever held a drug abusing welfare receipent responsible for the welfare of his or her child. that's what demonRats do.. they make the hard working taxpayer shoulder that responsibility and then whine about their loss of liberty. I think it street shitter mentality myself.

 

first off, you do not pay 30% in federal income taxes, those making over a million only end up paying 19% like terresa Heinz to 24%.

And secondly, TANF which is welfare, only spends 0.005% of the total federal budget....your supposed 30% in federal income taxes paid is going towards Defense spending to the tune of $900 billion a year, in total....drug test the Military industrial complex, why dontcha?  

when the hubby and I were pulling in $160k a year, we only paid about 14% in federal income taxes, once we took all of our right offs/deductions....(he worked out of our home at the time so there was lots and lots of stuff we were able to deduct,) even a portion of our lawn maintenance, mortgage, snow removal, repainting the house, his car etc....
 
 
 
I'll tell you what, Onthefarleft

 

This just goes to show how much of an extremist nut-job you really are. If you think I'm on the far left, then you must be about a half inch away from terrorism.

 
next time you are in an airport, refuse to go through the metal detector and use that argument.

Get back to us with the results.

 

We've already discussed airport security. I recognize that you're ignorant and uneducated on how 4th amendment rights work, so I'll explain it again. There are levels, or degrees if you will, of invasion to a person's privacy and liberty of movement. And under certain circumstances these levels can be constitutionally satisfied with varying degrees of legitimate government/public interest. For example, in certain areas of the country random traffic stops can be permissible for the sake of checking for legal status, yet impermissible in others. A cop can at times develop a "reasonable suspicion" that might warrant a pat down. But cannot use that reasonable suspicion to justify a strip search. At other times, similar circumstances might not amount to a "reasonable" suspicion.

There are several factors that go into weighing the reasonableness of a search, though the basic goal is to weigh the infringement of individual liberty against the public interest. In the case of airport security checks, the infringement of liberty is overall minimal. But the public interest is very high. Therefore, airport security screenings tend to be constitutional. I'll make one exception, which is the new body x-ray devices which I think are quite possibly unconstitutional, as they would most likely fail to remain within the narrow field of permissible infringement of liberty, when weighed against the public interest.

Now, all that being said, requiring a drug test to apply for entitlement benefits does not serve a legitimate public interest and does not give rise to a reasonable concern. There is no evidence present that there is a significant or meaningful amount of welfare funding that is being spent on illegal drugs. There is no reasonable basis to connect potential drug use being potentially funded by potential benefits, but to excise other equally possible abuses of benefit funds, such as alcohol use or prostitution, or even less repugnant abuses, like frequent sharing of excess food stamps with other people. A demand for bodily fluids is a relatively high infringement of personal liberty, and based on all evidence the public interest is at best a hypothetical concern. Accordingly, this drug testing policy does not come anywhere close to passing constitutional muster.

whatthe hell?

I did not write that. How the hell??????
 
 
 
Onthefarleft....

 

If you are going to continue to insist that I'm somehow on the far left, I'm going to decide that you must be of such radical right wing extremism that you are in line with the Tim McVeighs of the world, wanting to overthrow the government, and accordingly I'll simply add you to my ignore list. On the other hand, if you want to actually start contributing something more than throwing accusations simply because someone disagrees with you, then must maybe we can have a discussion worth having.

 
are you equally incensed that government requires people to detail where they live, whom they live with, how much they earn, how much they have in the bank, who they have sex with, the results of the sex act, how much they spend on education, how much they invest with the failure to do so resulting in long prison terms?

You leftists always scream about privacy, yet the most glaring and intrusive invasion of privacy most of you would fight to the death to keep.

That is of course, the IRS 1040 form where every person must detail every intimate part of their life to the government.

 

Again, this is a radically extremist view to take. First of all, the constitution authorizes collection of the income tax, so your complains are irrelevant. Second of all, your complains are, at best, marginally honest. The 1040 does not demand to know with whom I have sex. I simply asks my marital status. When you become an adult, you'll understand how silly it is to think that asking my marital status is like asking with whom I have sex.

Now, if you don't like the constitution, I invite you to move to Canada or some other place outside of US jurisdiction and leave us in peace. There's no reason to try overthrowing our government or trying to trample upon our constitution over nothing more than your personal preferences or feelings. You can leave any time you like. If you think that the people's will is sufficient to change the constitution, then I suggest you write your Congressperson to ask them to propose an amendment.

OK...Im convinced......there needs to be a better way than drug testing...

But what else is there?

 

Well, honestly, a complete reworking of the welfare and social services system.

In my "ideal" scenario, increased spending would be combined with increased services as well as increased accountability. I think we could do alot if we could help, for example, single mothers more. If we could increase services to give them better abilities to start working on education or vocational training (like funding for child care programs, possibly try to tie these to community organizations like YMCAs, etc.), while also holding a higher standard for accountability that requisites receiving benefits with taking additional steps to better your long term situation. It would provide both ability to develop yourself, as well as a powerful incentive to do so, because if you don't remain in school you'll lose your benefits. And it would go a long way toward breaking the cycle of multi generation poverty that often lands people on the welfare roles.

I know it's probably not a popular concept among the right of center crowd. But I think it would be a good long term investment that will see reductions in overall expenditures a decade from now, because people are getting off the system instead of lingering on it repeatedly throughout their lives.

They cant, their only deal in debates on urban legends
 
 
 
 
Based on what numbers??

 

Based on the numbers in the report. Are you even paying attention? Or just reacting, like a cockroach that runs into a frenzy when it sees light?

 
The fucking housing projects here in Chicago are NOTHING BUT drunks and drug addicts - and they all live on welfare..

 

We're talking about Florida.

 
I've known many people on welfare and the strong majority of them were drug users - actually all of them except for a couple of them..

 

I've known many people on welfare and none of them were drug users. Guess that got us nowhere, eh?

 
You're so full of shit...

 

  Because you've had so much to offer this discussion, eh?  

 

You think Miami is any different from Chicago?

You know people on welfare? yeah like who???? - yourself???

Yeah I bet you're living on welfare hence the program is all good and great - because you're getting free internet and vouchers for rent.. But you don't use drugs..

You see how that works...

You ever been to a housing project???

They have them in Miami too...

Except down there they're all smoking crack in the projects..

Now fuck them - if they want free housing they can take a fucking drug test. Florida taxpayers shouldn't be forced to pay for a bunch of crackheads..

If they don't like it they can stop using drugs or live on the streets or with someone what is NOT on section 8..
 
 
 
You think those in prison have privacy??  

Being stripped searched daily is privacy? having every piece of your mail opened and read is privacy?? having your items searched once a week is privacy??

 

I've already explained how the varying levels of infringement in privacy work on the constitutional level. Multiple times. I'm not going to go into again, go look it up for yourself. You're not being educated in this, you're just ranting.

well we've already explained to your dumb ass that most of the working taxpaying American citizens are drug tested as part of their employment and I see no reason why those individuals should work their axs off to subsidize the drug users..
 
 
 
Mr nick stays mad...lol

You need to go outside, bruv

 

It's raining, oh and I have a cold.

Of course I'm mad, some posters are basically saying welfare recipients have the right to do drugs while they live for free... If they live for free they're obviously getting drugs using their welfare check..

If they were opposed to my assertion then they would support drug testing welfare recipients..

As far as I see it if you're living off the taxpayer hence the government you are required to abide by the rules of those who provide free roof they live under and those who feed them..

You ever hear the old saying a parent tells a teenager: "if you live under my roof you will live by my rules because I pay the bills."

Well the same concept applies here..
 
 
 
 
OK...Im convinced......there needs to be a better way than drug testing...

But what else is there?

 

Well, honestly, a complete reworking of the welfare and social services system.

In my "ideal" scenario, increased spending would be combined with increased services as well as increased accountability. I think we could do alot if we could help, for example, single mothers more. If we could increase services to give them better abilities to start working on education or vocational training (like funding for child care programs, possibly try to tie these to community organizations like YMCAs, etc.), while also holding a higher standard for accountability that requisites receiving benefits with taking additional steps to better your long term situation. It would provide both ability to develop yourself, as well as a powerful incentive to do so, because if you don't remain in school you'll lose your benefits. And it would go a long way toward breaking the cycle of multi generation poverty that often lands people on the welfare roles.

I know it's probably not a popular concept among the right of center crowd. But I think it would be a good long term investment that will see reductions in overall expenditures a decade from now, because people are getting off the system instead of lingering on it repeatedly throughout their lives.

 

you are assuming the sytem would not be gamed.
Let me tell you what I experienced this past year.

NY State has a program...if you qualify, you can collect unemployment while taking courses in ICD-9 (medical coding). The state pays the tuition.

Schools that offer the course MUST accept these students to remain accredited schools in the eyes of NYS.

Now here is the problem...

The schools are bursting at the seams....sounds good. No?

No. Its the worst case scenario. You see, those schools must accept these students and as a result have to turn other students NOT on the NYS list away...Doesnt sound like a major problem...but look at what is happening...

Over 1/3 of the students do not show up for class. When the time comes to "pass or fail". well over 1/3 fail as they rarely attend class...and that ruins the "rating" of the school. Then...of those that show uyp for cl;ass and pass...they must go through an externship program. They get paid, and lose their unemployment for that period (it is deferred, not lost).....sounds OK...but the proiblem? Over 30% of them show up for the first day to the exterrnship, but prefer to not continue and no show after that and go back to their unemployment. So now the schools are losing their relationships with the medical facilities that offer their students externships as they have "no shows"...

So the outcome?

Those that WANT to take the courses cant becuase they are locked out.
Those that dont want to take the courses, have to "at least try"...and then no show to the classes and fail.
The schools that used to brag about 90% success rates now have less than 70% success rates
Medical facilities no longer trust the students coming out of the schools...

Oh yeah...and NYS is spending millions on the program.
 
 
Mr Nick the lazy pothead and drug dealer friend sure likes to generalize. I bet his whole family is on drugs

Furthermore you wouldn't know the constitution if it slapped you upside your head...

Also, I'm the libertarian here...

You know you're wrong when you have a true libertarian arguing that the state has a right to drug test those living off of the taxpayers...

This policy is a requirement for a FREE SERVICE - if you cant meet the requirements then you don't get the FREE SERVICE..

Besides, pissing in a cup isn't intrusive at all...

We regularly drug test where I work, in fact my job duties include administering the drug and alcohol program, so I am all for drug testing. The use of illicit drugs is forbidden and against the law. If you are not breaking the law you won't have anything to worry about. I have had to take several drug tests in my lifetime when getting hired for a job. If someone is giving you money whether it’s for actually working or for NOT working you need to play by the rules, that’s part of the gig. Don’t like it? Go elsewhere.
 
 
People who say that the drugs cost money and the people cant afford them. Do you know if you pass the test you do not have to pay it?? Only if you fail. How do I know I live so close to FL I get FL news.
 
 
Liberals and Personal Responsibility have never met.

Don't confuse libertarian with anarchy...

Requirements for entitlements DO NOT violate the libertarian premise...

As a matter of fact there would be no "welfare" under true libertarianism...

If you want to live off the taxpayer you have to answer to the taxpayer...

Now, no one will go to jail if they fail the drug test - their free money will just be revoked...

Quite frankly I believe drugs should be legalized, and even if they were legal - I would still support drug testing welfare recipients..

Remember we're talking about welfare recipients here not those collecting their social security...

I find drug testing employees to be highly intrusive...

These are people who are clearly supporting themselves and paying taxes (so welfare fucks can live for free)..........

They shouldn't be subjected to such an intrusion - especially if there is no reason to suspect the person is using drugs..

It's not a companies business what a person does in their private lives..

If they show up to work and do their duties as expected then thats all that matters.
 
 
 
 
 
Does being poor in America enough to provide the government with "reasonable cause" under the Constitution for mandatory drug testing?

 

No, being poor is not "reasonable cause" for mandatory drug testing.

Neither is applying for welfare mandatory.

Both are voluntary.

 

If you are assaulted, there is no mandate that you report the crime to the police. It's a voluntary act. Should the police start mandating drug tests to ensure that you are sober, and thus giving an accurate reporting?

 

You aren't I lawyer, and I would never try if I were you.

Apparently you don't understand that welfare is a choice - NOT a right..

It's NOT a Fourth Amendment violation - no one is forcing them to take a drug test.

Cops breaking into someones home without a warrant is a 4th Amendment violation - requiring a person to take a drug test in order to partake in a program is NOT a Fourth Amendment violation..

Do you know the armed services requires those who wish to serve our country to take a drug test before enlistment??

Is that a Fourth Amendment violation??

Whats the difference??

I don't see people bitching about new cadets having to take a drug test...

People are not forced to go on welfare and if they chose to - why the fuck should they be accepted if they're junkies??

Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

 
MIAMI  State figures show that hundreds of welfare applicants in Florida have declined to take drug tests that have been required for the assistance since mid-July.
Thirty-two applicants failed the test, 7,028 passed and 1,597 didnt take it, according figures released Tuesday the Department of Children and Families. People who decline to take the test arent required to explain.

Proponents of the law have suggested applicants would be deterred because they knew they would test positive. Critics say applicants may not have taken the test because they couldnt afford the fee that can be as much as $35 or didnt have easy access to a testing facility.

 

Not sure how I feel about this.

 

Not sure how you feel? Come on people, do we really think there are not a lot of people who collect Welfare and use a lot of their Money to support Drug Habits? Should we really have to care for even those who wish to use what we give them to do illegal drugs?
 
 
 
Truly, I don't get folks using the constitution as a means to justify illegal activity. Ya might consider putting down the bongs and come back to reality...brain cells are beginning to fade.

 

One big Problem with their Constitutional Argument. The Constitution Does not say anything about requiring Drug tests as a means to get something in Return. Our Right to not be searched or Drug Testes is Given up, when we apply for Assistance funded by Tax Payer Dollars. The entire Argument is Bogus, and clearly nothing but a way to protect people who use drugs and claim welfare.

You are an idiot, the 4th Amendment protects you from unwarranted searches, When you apply for Welfare drug testing is entirely warranted. You are not being singled out for no reason and given a random Test, you are asking for a hand out, and we are asking you take a test to get it. The Government has every right to make testing clean a requirement to receive Benefits.
 
 
I love how the conservatives er republicans favor the idea because its "illegal activity" while I favor the idea because tax dollars shouldn't be spent on those that will use the money to get high. If they want to do drugs they can get a job...

I could care less who does drugs nor do I care if they use drugs...

Who the fuck is the government to define what people can and cant ingest??

You must have missed my post that explained my hesitancy. I worried that some recipients may not live near a drug testing site and didn't have travel available to one. Either that, or the cost was prohibitive.

To take care of those problems, I suggested DTD's (Drug Testing Drivers) to pick up those who needed a ride and take them to and from the drug testing site. For the cost, if the recipient didn't have the money, the cost of the test could be deducted from their check.

With these problems out of the way, there would be no good reason for any one to pass up taking the test unless they knew they would fail it. Then no check.

The law was designed for those in need who could not provide for food, shelter and clothing for themselves or their family. If they had money for illegal drugs, obviously they had money for their needs provided for by that law. That means giving them a check would be in violation of the law.

Hope that takes care of your concern with my post.

At the same time - I'm not going to sit here and tell adults what they can and cant do.

First off a tax rebate would already be my money.... not something i was trying to get for free.

Now if the government said they were going to give out free money..... and all you and to do to collect it was to pass a drug test.... sign me up. Its my choice to sigh up and take the money... knowing the requirement for the free money is a clean test.

You're wrong on this. A contract freely entered into is part of the interaction between people. The seeker of welfare is free not to enter into the contract to receive public aid. IF they do though, they must abide by the terms.

there is no charity that would be free from such a thing....the charity certainly is not drug testing all of the poor they help...you donate for all the ones that need it, it is your heart that is in the right place....that's how I view it.....

and do you think the charity is KNOWINGLY doing this as you implied? their charitable contributions may end up going towards that with a few of who they take care of, but I seriously doubt they knowingly give money to a person to go buy their drugs with it.

The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution is the part of the Bill of Rights which guards against unreasonable searches and seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause.

This amendment is to be used against forced search and seizures. When the drug test is voluntary, the 4th amendment is not applicable.

No one is forced to accept welfare, nor take the test.

No one is forced to accept welfare, nor take the test.

 

uhhhh, you are just GUESSING on that....jackson....
 
 
 
I love how the conservatives er republicans favor the idea because its "illegal activity" while I favor the idea because tax dollars shouldn't be spent on those that will use the money to get high. If they want to do drugs they can get a job...

I could care less who does drugs nor do I care if they use drugs...

Who the fuck is the government to define what people can and cant ingest??

But it shouldn't be the taxpayers responsibility to make sure those on welfare are high...

 

Well, you aren't speaking for me, I agree with it not only because it is an illegal activity, but believe as you, taxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing their habits. I also agree with the idea because some of these folks are parents, aside from the obvious exposure to this lifestyle, they have an obligation to their children to be better examples as law abiding, productive members of society.
 
 
not forced search and seizure but ANY search and seizure by our gvt needs reasonable cause....

WHERE is that 'cause' jackson....?
 
 
 
 
Truly, I don't get folks using the constitution as a means to justify illegal activity. Ya might consider putting down the bongs and come back to reality...brain cells are beginning to fade.

 

lilbug, I don't do drugs, and never have, even though I did go to college!  

the constitution and the 4th amendment is not for YOU to decide to eliminate it.... every citizen has constitutional rights and protections from our government, whether they are doing something illegal, or not.... please take the time to read our constitution and some studies on what it really means....it's a beautiful document!!!

 

I'm not aksing for the 4th amendment to be eliminated at all. I'm asking that the true intent of it not be stretched, warped completely out of it's original intent to justify illegal and immoral activities and on top of that expect those of who don't imbibe in illegal substances, have jobs, pay taxes, to pay for their habits. Yeah, well, I wondered when the insults to my intelligence would be trolling out...another tactic folks use when they don't have a leg to stand on.

You are lucky she didn't call you a liar.. That's her usual response to those she disagrees with..
 
 
 
question...

What would be your response if you were told that the government was going to give all Americans a tax rebate....but you had to take a drug test to get it?

 

Thats fine.

But if the working poor on Food Stamps alone were required to take a drug test, that would be a potential violation.

 
The law was designed for those in need who could not provide for food, shelter and clothing for themselves or their family. If they had money for illegal drugs, obviously they had money for their needs provided for by that law. That means giving them a check would be in violation of the law.

 

Thats not the issue  the issue is being a public assistance applicant is not justifiable cause to suspect one of using illegal drugs, the motive for the testing is pure animus.

 
uhhhh, you are just GUESSING on that....jackson....

 

No, hes not guessing, he got it completely wrong.

 
Well, you aren't speaking for me, I agree with it not only because it is an illegal activity, but believe as you, taxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing their habits.

Thats the problem: you have no evidence one is involved in an illegal activity, save applying for public assistance. Preventing such action is the original intent of the 4th Amendment.

In essence you are advocating a doctrine of guilty until proven innocent.
 
 
 
 
OK...Im convinced......there needs to be a better way than drug testing...

But what else is there?

 

Well, honestly, a complete reworking of the welfare and social services system.

In my "ideal" scenario, increased spending would be combined with increased services as well as increased accountability. I think we could do alot if we could help, for example, single mothers more. If we could increase services to give them better abilities to start working on education or vocational training (like funding for child care programs, possibly try to tie these to community organizations like YMCAs, etc.), while also holding a higher standard for accountability that requisites receiving benefits with taking additional steps to better your long term situation. It would provide both ability to develop yourself, as well as a powerful incentive to do so, because if you don't remain in school you'll lose your benefits. And it would go a long way toward breaking the cycle of multi generation poverty that often lands people on the welfare roles.

I know it's probably not a popular concept among the right of center crowd. But I think it would be a good long term investment that will see reductions in overall expenditures a decade from now, because people are getting off the system instead of lingering on it repeatedly throughout their lives.

 

You know, it doesn't matter if you believe in the bible or not, but roughly 2000 years ago some wrote down that the poor will always be with you. Or words to that effect. So far they were right, no matter how much you give to the poor there are always more poor. So how much are you willing to give? I give to at least 3 local charities and 2 national ones, along with half a dozen veteran organizations.

This is complete bull. I'm not telling anyone how to live. Just one those blanket accusations that are meaningless.

In essence you are advocating a doctrine of ‘guilty until proven innocent.’

 

Innocent?! This idea had to come from somewhere. Evidently there has been a need recognized that measures to be taken to stop their abuse of drugs and the system as the honor system clearly is not working.

I'm advocating checks and balances, if this is most effective way to weed out abusers, then so be it, but I suspect abusers will pull out another one of their constitutional rights and get up on thier soapbox to any attempts that hold them accountable for their own actions.
 
 
Wow, long thread and here I am jumping in at the end. I've seen very little concern for the kids of those receiving government assistance. Don't they have a right to have parents that don't do drugs?? Why would anyone think it's OK??

Kids need help, kids need food,kids need a place to live and sleep, kids need clothes, that's what those checks are supposed to take care of, not their parents drug habits, drinking habits or smoking habits.

If you can afford drugs, booze and cigs you can afford to feed, clothe and give your kids a place to sleep. I should not be responsible for your drug habits. It's going to cost the same for me to support those kids in your home or in a foster home.

4th amendment rights do not apply when you are asking for help. I give a lot to charity, I've given a lot to friends and family that needed help. But you know what?? I pay the gas bill, go buy the groceries, and pay the landlord so the kids have food, heat and a place to live. I don't give the $ to the adult to do with what they want, why should I expect less of the government assistance they get???
 
 
 
not forced search and seizure but ANY search and seizure by our gvt needs reasonable cause....

WHERE is that 'cause' jackson....?

 

Hi! I'm back. "Cause" would be required if you are not volunteering. At the present time, when a person comes into a recruiting office to sign up for the service, they are required to take a drug test. There is no cause. But again, there is no draft, and the person is volunteering to be in the service. So again, I would not think that the 4th amendment applies.

I am not Judge Scalia, so we will actually see how this sorts out in Florida. But this is only my opinion.

Welfare is intended to provide the cost of food, shelter and clothing to those who cannot provide for themselves or their family. Fraud of welfare is when the government finds that they have the funds to purchase other expensive items, say a cruise, and still accept the welfare check.

One way to immediate catch abuse of the law is to check the recipient for drugs and that would signal an income that is not reported. If someone is going to say the are an "occasional user", they would certainly have had the intelligence to be clean on the day they come in for testing. Right?

Volunteer to accept welfare = volunteer to take a drug test

like i said in my rep jackson, there are some cases that relate to the military and gvt employees regarding drug testing that i would need to read completely before i could answer with any kind of assurance of accuracy....

BUTTTTT, if i were to venture to guess, the reasonable cause for drug testing the military is they have very dangerous jobs, or can be sent to war on a dime, they operate and fix machinery and arms....some positions hold secrets that need to be kept, and all of those kind of things would be ''reasonable cause'' to drug test.
 
 
Perhaps, as I am sure to have posted before, the biggest flaw in the system is so many considering 'the poor' of the land the weakest link. That is most likely WRONG.

That would make sense.
 
 
Just some final thoughts on this and then I'm done as I think I've stated my position on this pretty clearly. I think there has been a need recognized for the need for drug testing and the blame for that lies squarely on the folks who are guilty, and no one screams foul louder than folks caught with their hands in the cookie jar. I think if drug testing had been required on a regular basis at the outset of applying for assistance there wouldn't be such a fuss about it, but now when folks are demanding accountability, out trot the rights advocates. I also think this would have prevented a lot of the abuse we now see of public assistance services in the first place.

America is in a crisis, suffering from the slackers in society, and folks who are picking up the slack for these folks are damn tired and fed up. If you or someone you know is guilty of receiving assistance and also has a drug habit, or in some other way is abusing that assistance, if not this law, then one way or another, your day of reckoning is coming. This country is fed up with carrying your load. You have taken advantage of the shortcomings and loop holes, you're abusing the system and just stickin' it to the folks who are paying the taxes to enable you to skate. Shame on you all. You have become a malignancy of America, and your time to be cut out, cut off is coming. Not only have you abused fellow Americans, your actions have brought shame to the very idea of even receiving assistance. You have completely corrupted the system and it's orginal intent and you have denounced, snubbed the rights of folks who expect more from you. Those with children, have failed their children to be examples of productive, law abiding citizens and proud, hardworking Americans. So, trot out your rights if you must, but, mark my words, your day is coming, the free ride, one way another is coming to end. Better start dustin' off those resumes'.

To those who debated this topic with me without the insults to my intelligence, or some other kind of personal dig, it's been a good debate...to the others, your entire postion was muddied and held little credence by resorting to these tactics.
 
 
so we should have charities giving drug tests also?
 
 
 
well we've already explained to your dumb ass that most of the working taxpaying American citizens are drug tested as part of their employment and I see no reason why those individuals should work their axs off to subsidize the drug users..

 

You know, I agree. I see no reason why taxpayers should subsidize drug use. Okay, now go out and find my some evidence that it's happening. And collect that evidence without dismissing the constitution.
 
 
 
Nearly 1,600 Fla. welfare applicants decline to take drug test, fueling debate over new law

 
MIAMI  State figures show that hundreds of welfare applicants in Florida have declined to take drug tests that have been required for the assistance since mid-July.
Thirty-two applicants failed the test, 7,028 passed and 1,597 didnt take it, according figures released Tuesday the Department of Children and Families. People who decline to take the test arent required to explain.

Proponents of the law have suggested applicants would be deterred because they knew they would test positive. Critics say applicants may not have taken the test because they couldnt afford the fee that can be as much as $35 or didnt have easy access to a testing facility.

 

Not sure how I feel about this.

 

Simple, they refuse the testing they lose their handouts. Then investigate them for drug use and fraud, charge them if warranted and throw them in prison, where they still get free benefits.

are they doing alcohol testing, too?

either way... are you going to starve people for smoking a joint? pure harassment, imo.

 

Wrong. If they want to live on other peoples hard earned money they better take the test.
 
 
 
Oh you're so full of shit - you have explained nothing...

 

  Yes I have. Go look for it.  

 
Furthermore you wouldn't know the constitution if it slapped you upside your head...

 

  Then why am I the only one who has gone in depth into the constitution's 4th amendment protections? All people like you and Willow are doing is crying about how much you don't like the constitution.  

 
Also, I'm the libertarian here...

 

  You say that as if it's a good thing or makes you special.  

 
You know you're wrong when you have a true libertarian arguing that the state has a right to drug test those living off of the taxpayers...

 

Actually, I know that you're nothing but an emotionally raging class warrior.  

 
This policy is a requirement for a FREE SERVICE - if you cant meet the requirements then you don't get the FREE SERVICE..

 

Okay, so you have no problem with the police requiring a drug test before you receive their free services?

 
Besides, pissing in a cup isn't intrusive at all...

 

It's taking part of your body. You don't find that at all intrusive?  
 
 
 
If you are not breaking the law you won't have anything to worry about.

 

This is one of the most God awful arguments that people utter in support of government invasions of privacy. Using this argument we'd have to agree that the police should have the right to come into your house any time they wish and start snooping around. After all, if you're not breaking the law you won't have anything to worry about, right?
 
 
 
I find drug testing employees to be highly intrusive...

 

But not the government!  

 
These are people who are clearly supporting themselves and paying taxes (so welfare fucks can live for free)..........

 

Well, at least you're not engaging in class warfare.  

 
They shouldn't be subjected to such an intrusion - especially if there is no reason to suspect the person is using drugs..

 

So, private companies should have to abide by the concepts of the constitution, but the government should engage in class warfare even if it means violating constitutional rights.  

 
It's not a companies business what a person does in their private lives..

 

But it's very much government's business. You're really the true libertarian here.  
 
 
I have put a lot of thought into this debate...and I have read the responses to my arguments I laid out supporting both sides of the debate...and to be frank, MOST on welfare do not want to be on welfare...they have no other choice...for whatever reason...be it an intelligence issue, a physical disibility, economic issues, etc.....and for them to accept welfare, for many, is humiliating in itself...but a must for survival.

For those people to be forced to suffer further humiliation by peeing in a cup to "get their money" is wrong..

To punish the masses due to the actions of a few is not the direction we should be going.

That being said, I just wish the progressives would think the same way. They seem to want to punish the majority of business owners due to the actions of a few...but that is another debate for another thread.
 
 
 
if you don't want to be tested, walk away

 

Why should people simply abandon their constitutional rights? Why do you hate the constitution so much that you would expect people to give up their rights just so your ideological goals can win out? What makes you think that your ideology is more important than the constitution?

 
don't take our money honey. it's all good. it's your choice.

 

And what makes is your money?

In my eyes, constitutional rights is not the argument.
No one is forced to apply for Welfare. It is an option.

To me, the argument is....why humiliate people even more than they are already humiliated?

I did not accept unemployment years ago before I started my fuirst company. I was eligible....and I could have gotten enough to support myself while looking for a new position. But I preferred an 6.75 an hour job bagging groceries becuase I was humiliated to accept unempl;oyment.

Taking money you dont earn is a humliating experience. Lets not make it worse by punishing the masses due to the actions of a few.

Apparently you don't understand that welfare is a choice - NOT a right..

It's NOT a Fourth Amendment violation - no one is forcing them to take a drug test.

 

Driving is a choice, not a right. Yet, it's a fourth amendment violation if police forced you to submit to a search, without probable cause, before allowing you to drive.

 
Cops breaking into someones home without a warrant is a 4th Amendment violation - requiring a person to take a drug test in order to partake in a program is NOT a Fourth Amendment violation.

 

Er, yep, it is. You just don't have an understanding of how the fourth amendment works. Which is too bad for you, because you're quite vulnerable to having your rights trampled by an abusive government, because you won't recognize the abuse happening.

 
Do you know the armed services requires those who wish to serve our country to take a drug test before enlistment??

Is that a Fourth Amendment violation??

Whats the difference??

 

This is an employment matter, and is about as comparable to this discussion as keeping a lion on a nature preserve is to keeping a pet cat in your home.

 
People are not forced to go on welfare and if they chose to - why the fuck should they be accepted if they're junkies??

 

At best, your arguing that our welfare system needs new reforms. But that need does not alleviate constitutional protections.
 
 
 
they search the innocent by the thousands each and every day..

I guess youse never been on an aeroplane huh hunny?

 

I have, twice now, already explained in detail the constitutional application of airport security checkpoints. The fact that you're still trying to beat out this pathetically weak argument just goes to show that you're not here to say anything honest. You're just here to beat a drum. If you're not going to be honest, just stop. Go stand on a corner and shout the Gospel to cars passing by. Go babble to the Phelps family about the joys of gay sex. Go demonstrate in front of Congress. Either one of those those things would be slightly less a waste of your breath than to sit here and lie in this discussion.
 
 
I wonder how those that are for the drug testing would feel if the government started to drug test you before they let you through the security gates at an airport.
 
 
 
Truly, I don't get folks using the constitution as a means to justify illegal activity.

 

Nobody here is doing that. Why would you make such an accusation? The only thing people here are doing is affirming that the constitution guarantees us certain rights. For example, you have the right to legal council. If you commit a murder, your lawyer can argue your rights through the case. He might be able to successfully defend you from prosecution and gain a "not guilty" verdict for you, even though you did commit the murder. Based on your comment here, you seem to think that the constitution should cease to apply the moment an accusation is made. That is, however, not how the constitution works, and would leave the door wide open for the government to abuse its citizenry.

You also have no evidence of any significant amount of people being drug users. Based on the numbers that the article provided, only 0.005% of applicants were shown to have recently used drugs. You're thinking subjects thousands to unconstitutional invasions of privacy for the sake of 32 who used drugs recently.

 
Ya might consider putting down the bongs and come back to reality...brain cells are beginning to fade.

 

You might want to wake up from your totalitarian state dream fantasy and come back to reality. Your respectability is beginning to fade (anyone who willingly gives up their freedoms without a fight is not respectable).
 
 
 
Driving is a choice, not a right.

 

Bullshit. The ability to operate private property which I have legally purchased, to wit the vehicle, is a right, not a privilege granted by my rulers. You of the extreme left view government as your parent, to care for you, decide what you may do, allow you certain privilege and punish those who don't obey.

You cannot grasp the concept of liberty. You are a dependent.

 
Yet, it's a fourth amendment violation if police forced you to submit to a search, without probable cause, before allowing you to drive.

 

Really?

The California DMV does a very intrusive search in the form of a vision test, before providing a license to drive.

 
Er, yep, it is. You just don't have an understanding of how the fourth amendment works. Which is too bad for you, because you're quite vulnerable to having your rights trampled by an abusive government, because you won't recognize the abuse happening.

 

Izzaterite?

No Knock warrants are the favorite of the police state and it's leftist advocates, as the great constitutional you purport yourself to be, do these violate the right to be secure in ones person and papers?

 
This is an employment matter, and is about as comparable to this discussion as keeping a lion on a nature preserve is to keeping a pet cat in your home.

 

How does an employment matter fundamentally differ from a public compensation matter? Cite with case law.

 
At best, your arguing that our welfare system needs new reforms. But that need does not alleviate constitutional protections.

 

I think that he is arguing that voluntary submission to drug tests in order to receive public compensation fall into the same category as drug tests for military personnel.

His argument is quite convincing, yours not so much...
 
 
 
Come on people, do we really think there are not a lot of people who collect Welfare and use a lot of their Money to support Drug Habits?

 

I think that people who qualify for benefits don't really have the money to buy drugs even if they wanted to, even after receiving their benefits. I think that drug dealers won't accept food stamps as payment. I think that most other forms of welfare don't even pass through the recipients hands. I think that there's no way for a person on welfare to divert his own section 8 to a drug dealer to pay for drugs.

I also notice how the article's figures show that only 0.005% of Florida applicants used drugs recently before applying. I think that that goes to show that people like to indulge in prejudice on these things so that they can justify their class warfare agenda.

Nobody here is doing that. Why would you make such an accusation? The only thing people here are doing is affirming that the constitution guarantees us certain rights. For example, you have the right to legal council. If you commit a murder, your lawyer can argue your rights through the case. He might be able to successfully defend you from prosecution and gain a "not guilty" verdict for you, even though you did commit the murder. Based on your comment here, you seem to think that the constitution should cease to apply the moment an accusation is made. That is, however, not how the constitution works, and would leave the door wide open for the government to abuse its citizenry.

You also have no evidence of any significant amount of people being drug users. Based on the numbers that the article provided, only 0.005% of applicants were shown to have recently used drugs. You're thinking subjects thousands to unconstitutional invasions of privacy for the sake of 32 who used drugs recently.

 
Ya might consider putting down the bongs and come back to reality...brain cells are beginning to fade.

 

You might want to wake up from your totalitarian state dream fantasy and come back to reality. Your respectability is beginning to fade (anyone who willingly gives up their freedoms without a fight is not respectable).

 

I may think as you do as it pertians to the drug testing....

But I completely disagree with you as to why it is wrong.

You will have a hard time in court showing how it is unconsitutional to drug test for the opiton of applying for welfare when, as one pointed out, the government insists o an eye test before approving your personal decision to get a drivers license.

In my eyes, this is a humanity issue.

Why should we humliate the masses with a drug test becuase of the action of a few.
 
 
 
One big Problem with their Constitutional Argument. The Constitution Does not say anything about requiring Drug tests as a means to get something in Return.

 

Under this line of reasoning, there would be nothing wrong with the police requiring you to take a drug test before you file a police report. When you file a police report you're receiving services from the government, paid for with tax money.

Constitutional protections against search and seizure are not predicated on any concept of receiving anything in return. If the government could require you to forfeit your constitutional rights based on "receiving in return" then what would stop them from entering your house every day and searching your home under the guise of receiving your freedom in return? What would stop them from quartering soldiers in your home under the notion that you are receiving protection in return from foreign invaders?

If constitutional mechanisms operated in this fashion, they would in fact bear little value or meaning. Any interpretation of the constitution that would allow the constitution itself to become meaningless cannot be maintained.

 
Our Right to not be searched or Drug Testes is Given up, when we apply for Assistance funded by Tax Payer Dollars.

 

Er, no, not true. You want it to be true because you don't want people you don't like having constitutional rights. You want it to be true because you want to engage in class warfare and to have the government do the same, and the constitution is an obstruction to that goal. But that's about it.

 
The entire Argument is Bogus, and clearly nothing but a way to protect people who use drugs and claim welfare.

 

Actually, the argument is sound, based on the long standing interpretations of fourth amendment rights that the federal courts have long maintained through history, with the intention to protect innocent citizens who have done nothing wrong, as demonstrated by the figures. Your argument would require undoing 200 years of case law, abandoning a clear reading of the constitution, and inserting new text. All in your effort to engage in class warfare.
 
 
 
The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution is the part of the Bill of Rights which guards against unreasonable searches and seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause.

This amendment is to be used against forced search and seizures. When the drug test is voluntary, the 4th amendment is not applicable.

No one is forced to accept welfare, nor take the test.

 

What you all continue to either not understand (in your case) or deliberately ignore (in some other people's cases here) is that the VOLUNTARY is not a magical word that you can write on a piece of paper and make it true, or remove constitutional problems.

The courts have long maintained that simply calling a search voluntary is irrelevant when a quid pro quo circumstance arises, or when the government acts in a way as to imply submission is mandatory, or when the government is acting in such circumstances as a person might reasonably expect that their submission is required.

There have been cases hashing out these issues many times. One that comes to mind (I can't remember the name but I'll try to look it up) involved a man who had been under investigation for smuggling drugs into the country. He was approached by police in an airport, he was "asked" to come with them to answer a few questions. He was then escorted to a room, and "asked" to hand over his briefcase and to produce the key. This lead to the discovery of several kilos of cocaine in his possession. Ultimately the Supreme Court suppressed the evidence as a fourth amendment violation.

This is what it comes down to: When the government suggests in any way that submission is mandatory, or when they rely on quid pro quo to elicit a "voluntary" submission, then any ensuing search is not in fact voluntary for the sake of the fourth amendment.
 
 
 
You know, it doesn't matter if you believe in the bible or not, but roughly 2000 years ago some wrote down that the poor will always be with you. Or words to that effect. So far they were right, no matter how much you give to the poor there are always more poor. So how much are you willing to give? I give to at least 3 local charities and 2 national ones, along with half a dozen veteran organizations.

 

 
 
 
 
Wow, long thread and here I am jumping in at the end. I've seen very little concern for the kids of those receiving government assistance. Don't they have a right to have parents that don't do drugs?? Why would anyone think it's OK??

 

Who ever said it's okay? I don't think anyone here feels it's okay for children to have to be raised by parents who are unable to provide for them in the first place and then who are habitual drug users on top of it. But then again, why are you assuming this scenario? You're raising a hypothetical. Based on the figures only 0.005% of applicants had recently used drugs. There's nothing to even suggest that those applicants were parents.

 
Kids need help, kids need food,kids need a place to live and sleep, kids need clothes, that's what those checks are supposed to take care of, not their parents drug habits, drinking habits or smoking habits.

 

Again, show evidence that this is happening on any substantial scale in Florida.

 
If you can afford drugs, booze and cigs you can afford to feed, clothe and give your kids a place to sleep. I should not be responsible for your drug habits.

 

I'd agree. Except show me evidence that it happens that Floridian welfare recipients buy drugs, booze, or cigarettes while failing to feed and clothe their kids or give them a place to sleep.

 
It's going to cost the same for me to support those kids in your home or in a foster home.

 

Well, that raises an interesting question. Do we want more or less government intrusion into people's lives?

 
4th amendment rights do not apply when you are asking for help.

 

  Yes they do.   If you go to the police station to report a disorderly neighbor who is harassing you, do you think you should be required to submit to a drug test?

 
I give a lot to charity, I've given a lot to friends and family that needed help. But you know what?? I pay the gas bill, go buy the groceries, and pay the landlord so the kids have food, heat and a place to live. I don't give the $ to the adult to do with what they want, why should I expect less of the government assistance they get???

 

Please, do not say this again until you provide evidence that what you're saying actually happens.
 
 
 
BUTTTTT, if i were to venture to guess, the reasonable cause for drug testing the military is they have very dangerous jobs, or can be sent to war on a dime, they operate and fix machinery and arms....some positions hold secrets that need to be kept, and all of those kind of things would be ''reasonable cause'' to drug test.

 

Not to mention, the example confuses receiving government services with government employment. Requiring military recruits to take a drug test is an employment issue, and is permissible in the same manner as any other employer might do the same.
 
 
 
simple, they refuse the testing they lose their handouts. then investigate them for drug use and fraud, charge them if warranted and throw them in prison, where they still get free benefits.

 

THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, BECAUSE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS ARE MEANT TO PREVENT THE GOVERNMENT FROM BEING ABLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ABUSES.

Thank you for proving my point.  
 
 
 
it IS our money...that is a given.
Dont spin it to win a debate.

 

I'm asking Willow what makes it her money, because I don't think she lives in Florida, yet she seems to take the issue rather personally.

Becuase it is quite obvious that she is referring to welfare recipients nationwide....the debate originated from Floridas law, but the debate was AND STILL IS a national debate.

WOrd of advice...if you are going to parse words and spin in an effort to win a debate....you are showing a sign of weakness....and a sign that you are not completely comfortable with the position you hold.

Win a debate on your own sentiments....dont look for your opponenet to leave an opening.
 
 
 
You of the extreme left

 

Welcome to my ignore list, where terrorist extremists plot their attacks against the government, only to get destroyed by the glorious US of A! Rot in Hell.

Actually, I think it would be pretty easy. As I mentioned a while back in the thread, fourth amendment questions largely rely on a balancing test, where the infringement of an individual's liberty is weighted against the public interest at stake. In the case of driving licenses, there is a huge public interest at stake, since drivers with poor visibility would be a significant danger to the public. Also, the vision test you receive at a DMV is not a full vision test. It's a very small test that is meant to ensure minimum basic vision. This narrows the scope of the search and as such minimizes the infringement.

The drug testing question, however, would fail to provide an actual or compelling public interest. The figures available show only 0.005% of applicants using drugs recently before completing the application. There's no evidence to show any actual pressing concern. The state would only be able to argue a hypothetical concern, which is not even being supported by the discovered facts of its own program. Accordingly, I simply cannot see any judge seeing the balance tip in favor of this infringement.

 
In my eyes, this is a humanity issue.

Why should we humliate the masses with a drug test becuase of the action of a few.

 

I actually agree that it's a humanity issue. In my eyes that's what is at the very heart of the fourth amendment. People should not have to be subjected to such humiliation without a good reason. And a marginally small minority do not make it a good enough reason.

Ignoring me won't save your messages form the utter lack of reason they display. Your cowardice is on display for all to see.
 
 
 
 
Not the same at all.

Using government service is not at all the same as receiving a government check

 

Wow, that was stupid!! They're they exact same thing!!!      

 

No thinking they are exactly the same is stupid.

No one can get high and endanger their kids by calling the fire department or the cops.

See the difference dip shit?
 
 
 
 
I think that drug dealers won't accept food stamps as payment.

 

 Drug Dealer Accused Of Accepting Payment In Food Stamps And Welfare Benefits | Bossip 

 

The grocers are just as bad as the dope dealers.
They had a good distribution plan set up years ago that would distribute the foodat wholesale.
The grocers lobby fought that and lobbied for food stamps.
Retail.
Fraud in the food stamp program isat least 50%.

Hey asshole! Who died and left you king? Evidently the state of Florida has enough evidence to move forward with this legislation. It passed, was signed into law and is being enforced. You don't like it? don't live in Florida.. and don't pretend that people don't spend their money on drugs that could have been spent on necessities for their children. If that weren't the case we wouldn't be such a big welfare state. Dummie

gvt insisting on an eye test in order for you to drive, is not "unreasonable", it is "reasonable" as it relates to driving....but most importantly, an eye test will never give you a result in which the gvt can arrest you for..... or imprison you. It is NOT testifying against yourself, as a gvt forced drug test would be. The Welfare participant has done nothing wrong or suspicious to give probable cause to drug test them all.....and making them take a test that could end up imprisoning them is an over reach of our gvt....via the 4th and the 5th amendments.

what is the probable cause to give them this search? They are not being hired to do a dangerous job....

My state allows employers to drug test, under limited conditions....

the employer must have a state approved drug rehab center that they can have the employee that tested positive enter in to for 6 months, and the employer has to pay for this program for their employee before they can fire the employee....

the employee that tested positive in the workplace also has to be tested a second time, with a better drug test to ensure that the piss test did not give a faulty reading, which happens 10%-30% of the time.

there are other appeal processes for the employees as well.

The employer having to have a drug rehab program and all that jazz which protects the employee, is discouraging for many employers to take up drug testing in the work place.

and again, the difference between an employer hiring for a job and the government doing this to people that just receive assistance for their survival is the issue at hand.

The government is not hiring them to do a dangerous job for them.

the govt is telling thousands upon thousands of innocent people, that in order for their own govt to help them, they have to give up their 4th and 5th amendment rights....that is quid pro quo.....that is not voluntary....that is using gvt power, where they do not constitutionally have the power.

I believe when this makes it through the courts, it will be deemed unconstitutional.

and just for the record, I would never ever want a habitual drug addict to keep their kids when they abuse them or are lousy parents.

BUT, what was the process before that helped find these abusive parents? Certainly a social worker can spot the drug use or poor parenting when a neighbor reports such or another family member reports such abuse, and surely they have LEGAL means to pursue the removal of their children.

It is a strawman on poster's part to use this as a reason to have our gvernment abuse the powers constitutionally given to them!
