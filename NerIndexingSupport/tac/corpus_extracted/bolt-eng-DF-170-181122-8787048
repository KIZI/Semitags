Oprah Winfrey might have surprised her talk show audience Monday by giving them all a free, eight-day trip to Australia but the trip also surprised Australians -- with a A$3 million (US$2.8 million) bill.

Tourism Minister Martin Ferguson said the federal and state New South Wales governments would spend more than $3 million helping to bring "The Oprah Winfrey Show" to Australia as a way to boost tourism.

He said it was money well spent as it would put Australia in the spotlight with the popular TV show watched by 40 million Americans and screened in 145 countries.

"Oprah is a household name and her star power has the potential to lift Australia's profile as a premier tourist destination," Ferguson said in a statement Tuesday.

Former federal tourism minister John Brown asked the media not to be "cynical about the cost" at a time when the number of Australian leaving for overseas holidays outstrips the number of tourists coming to Australia for vacations.

"We spent hundreds of millions of dollars over 30 years without much effect, I must say that honestly," he told a news conference. "The publicity that Oprah will bring to Australia around the world is something you couldn't buy."

Oprah is a wealthy, racist, POS.
 
 
For a start the article is over 3 months old.
Nobody was surprised that Aussie tax payers were footing the bill
$3 million is nothing compared to the exposure the country will get.
The header and intro paragraph are misleading. Nowhere in the story does it quote any Australian who was surprised...
 
 
Oprah should help the poor, not blow money sending folks to Australia. Jaysus. She could give some people on unemployment some damn jobs maybe.

Seems to me the gift is not from Oprah so much as it is the people of Australia. But that's the way it works. There are lots of shows that give prizes to contestants, members of the audience and/or television viewers. I don't picture any of these shows doling out their own dollars for all these prizes on a daily basis for years on end. Deals are made. Prizes are "donated" by the sponsors and/or manufacturers, etc.

If it was a gift from Oprah, then she should have footed the bill or Australia should have gotten proper credit. Same for all the other shows.

 Oprah Winfrey - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 
Philanthropy
In 1998, Winfrey created the Oprah's Angel Network, a charity that supported charitable projects and provided grants to nonprofit organizations around the world. Oprah's Angel Network raised more than $80,000,000 ($1 million of which was donated by Jon Bon Jovi). Winfrey personally covered all administrative costs associated with the charity, so 100% of all funds raised went to charity programs. The charity stopped accepting donations in May 2010 and was later dissolved.[150][151]

Winfrey's show raises money through promotion of her public charity and she personally donates more of her own money to charity than any other show-business celebrity in America. In 2005 she became the first black person listed by Business Week as one of America's 50 most generous philanthropists, having given an estimated $303 million.[152] Winfrey was the 32nd most philanthropic. She has also been repeatedly ranked as the most philanthropic celebrity.[153]

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Oprah created the Oprah Angel Network Katrina registry which raised more than $11 million for relief efforts. Winfrey personally gave $10 million to the cause.[154] Homes were built in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama before the one year anniversary of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[155]

Winfrey has also helped 250 African-American men continue or complete their education at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.[156]

Winfrey was the recipient of the first Bob Hope Humanitarian Award at the 2002 Emmy Awards for services to television and film. To celebrate two decades on national TV, and to thank her employees for their hard work, Winfrey took her staff and their families (1065 people in total) on vacation to Hawaii in the summer of 2006.[157]

There was a lot of audience concern about the fate of some of the usual programming on Discovery Health, but apparently the most popular ones won't be removed (according to the website).

I think the point, which obviously sailed right over some heads on here, was that with her liberal point of view (which vilifies the wealthy and constantly uses the poor and down trodden as their reason for pilfering liberty and freedom) that she should be putting her money where her mouth is and living as a normal person while using her money to help those same poor and down trodden.

When does she vilify the wealthy? I've only heard her do that if someone completely wastes their money or uses it to scam other people (i.e., Maddoff). And why should she live like a pauper and give it ALL away? Why can't she do exactly what she does? Give away millions and live well at the same time. Oprah is also a great voice for philanthropy. What are Glenn Beck's philanthropic accomplishments? Or Rush Limbaugh's? They're millionnaires with big voices too, and they live high off the hog at the same time. But what do they do for the community (inclusive)? What are their causes?

I was just reading last night that Australia has an immigration policy that no one is allowed to immigrate until they have learned the English language and can prove it. I do hope they mean the Queen's English, and not that horrid Aussie dialect. I wonder what the cross would sound like if a Spanish immigrant had to learn Aussie.

The difference between Oprah and Beck is what they promote, I would think that would be obvious. Beck promotes individual responsibility and individual charity, and small government, less interference and control. You know, the left loves to hold the republicans up to their 'family values' mantra and when they fall from grace, they're called hypocrits for it. It's the same thing. The super wealthy on the left, politicians, entertianers, business men, etc..., all talk about how terrible the poor are treated in this country and how all of us should be paying more, and insist on using govrenment fiat to force their views on us, while they own several homes, private jets, live in luxury that few could ever even think of attaining. When they give most of what they have to the needy and live as common people do, then they may be able to preach to the rest of us, until then they are no more than hypocrits should STFU.

Thanks for not answering my question. That said, since when does Oprah NOT talk about individual responsibility and charity? She does both. Your millionnaire mouthpieces do not. They "promote" values that THEY consider ONLY members of the right wing family express. Which is bullshit.

She wanted to "experience the Aboriginal People?" No other reason given (she "heard from friends it was great"). I'm supposed to fly coach for 18 hours to see a bunch of black guys passed out after drinking 40 oz Malt Liquor?

WTF she couldn't visit Native Americans? She's never been downtown Detroit?

Sounds like a lotta crap: Oprah could afford to buy a dozen Koalas/Kangaroos and decorate her home with the little critters.

Oprah should help the poor, not blow money sending folks to Australia. Jaysus. She could give some people on unemployment some damn jobs maybe.

 

It's Oprah's money, dipwad. She earns it; she can spend it however she wants. LOL...and you claim to be part of what's right with this country. Baby steps...start by minding your own business.

 

Great point! Isn't that the mantra of the new right? They're also criticizing wealth.    

 

Only if that wealth comes from non-whites.  
 
 
"I have named myself an unofficial ambassador for Australia and I have the biggest mouth on earth," she said ahead of two star-studded episodes of her show before thousands of fans outside Sydney's newly re-christened "Oprah House."

"I know that there's a lot of talk and concern in this country as to what this will mean for Tourism Australia," she told reporters as 6,000 fans waited for Winfrey and her galaxy of guest stars to come on stage.

"Let me just tell you -- this is the truth: It is immeasurable what four hours of a love festival about your country, broadcast in 145 countries around the world, can do," she said, referring to her legendary selling power.

Winfrey, 56, backed by Tourism Australia and the national airline Qantas, brought 302 of her most loyal US audience members on a trip Down Under that has been punctuated by a blaze of flashbulbs and the screams of ecstatic fans.

Australia paid four to five million US dollars to lure the talk-show diva Down Under, a government minister said Tuesday, but pundits claim the exposure could be worth more than ten times that amount.

Haha so basically the Australian taxpayers just footed the bill for everyone to head over there. Bet they're loving that. Not.
 
 
 
 
 
I'm actually a little curious to find out why anyone who hasn't been convicted of Stealing a Chicken in London during the 1800's would go to Australia.

 

Because America is the best country in the world and theres nothing else out there worth seeing, right?

 

I was just reading last night that Australia has an immigration policy that no one is allowed to immigrate until they have learned the English language and can prove it. I do hope they mean the Queen's English, and not that horrid Aussie dialect. I wonder what the cross would sound like if a Spanish immigrant had to learn Aussie.

 

Fuck you.

1. They knew they were paying for it.
2. It was the best tourism advertising they could have had.

To the contrary.

But we're talking about Australia. WTF is there worth seeing that I couldn't see in Mexico, or Canada, and spend a fraction of the time and money?

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Um...duh... Thus the curiousity.

It's a long way to fly in coach to see a desert, or a beach, or to say, "G'day Mate," in a non-homosexual way.

 

Why did the chicken cross the road? If a tree falls in a forest and nobody is there, does it make a noise? You have any other pointless questions?

 

Your usual idiotic arguementive style: Fly 18 hours to Australia to find......What? Falling trees and chickens crossing the road?

 

Thanks for offering consistantly stupid rhetoric: Get back to me when you get a lucid moment, moron.

I suggest you read the book "In an Sunburned Country" by Bill Bryson. He covers EVERYTHING that MUST be seen in Australia. GREAT READ.

Sure, because you can see all of the things I listed in San Diego, huh?

Ever seen the Southern Cross? Do you even know WTH it is? Of course you don't, you're the average stupid American who never leaves this country because he doesn't think there's anything worth seeing outside our shores.

YOU are one of the gutless bores who give Americans a bad name around the world.

Grow the fuck up.

Great suggestions! Only problem is that you asked him/her to read something. If they are so dense about seeing other parts of the world, what are the chances they actually will pick up a book to read.

Question for Samson, the resident nit-wit.

True or false?

It sometimes snows in Australia in December (hint: when it is winter up here in the northern hemisphere, it is SUMMER in the Southern hemisphere genius).

I would argue that San Diego is one of our (USA's) most beautiful, livable cities--even if it is rather pricey. I spent some time there many years ago and I spent the entire plane ride home in tears, because I didn't want to leave. San Diego has wonderful beaches, temperate climate year round, while also having access to mountains and desert areas to the east of the city, so you have the best of many worlds within driving distance.

That said, I am pretty sure Australia has San Diego beat in many regards. Although nothing in Australia is close driving distance. Nothing. That place is HUGE....HUUUUUUGGGGEEEEE.

Doesn't look like your lobotomy is having the desired effect on you, Jen.

I can see fucking STARS where I am.

My objection to Australia is not that the stars are different, its that paying $1,500 RT Airfare to sit on a plane for 36 hours to see different STARS is fucking retarded.

Which brings me back to why a lobotomy will never help you: There's nothing to work with beteewn your ears. May as well lobotomize a fucking apple, you dumb bitch.

Whenever I don't believe humanity could be any stupider, all I need to do is read one of your moronic postings. Happily this is a rare event, and I ignore 99% of your lunatic blitherings.

 
 Deserts cover a large portion of the land in Australia . Most of the deserts lie in the central and north-western part of the country. The largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid. The size of the deserts in Australia combined is 1,371,000 square kilometres (529,000 sq mi), and occupy 38% of the continent

 

 
over one-third of Australia is made up of sandy or stony arid desert, while another 37% is semi-arid grassland or scrub.

Oprah mania takes in the eastern suburbs

Attempts to affect an attitude of cool surrounding Oprah Winfrey’s visit were all but obliterated on Tuesday morning, when 6000 people descended on the Opera House to watch the first of two live tapings of her show.

Brought out by Tourism Australia with 300 of her fans, Winfrey demonstrated her customary generosity.

In just a few hours, she gave a million dollars in computer equipment to Canterbury Boys High School and sent rapper Jay-Z along to see students; $250,000 to a Melbourne man whose YouTube video about his struggle with cancer went viral earlier this year; had Bon Jovi play; and gave pearl necklaces to all audience members.
