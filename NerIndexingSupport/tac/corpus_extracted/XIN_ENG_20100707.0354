The Los Angeles Clippers said on Tuesday that Vinny Del Negro will become the
team's head coach.

The Clippers said Tuesday in an email that more details would be announced on
Wednesday.

Del Negro was dismissed by the Chicago Bulls in May due to the team's poor
results.

The Clippers has significant salary cap space in their attempt to lure free
agent LeBron James from Cleveland. James will announce where he will play next
season on Thursday.
