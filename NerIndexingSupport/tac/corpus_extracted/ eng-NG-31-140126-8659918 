You know what really gets me steamed about the Dolphins' loss
yesterday? Â I was telling people all week that I was going with
Dallas. Besides the obvious reasoning that Miami's O needs to gel
before I think they'll win many games, I was thinking I'd rather be
happy with a loss (if I chose Dallas and Miami won, great), than be
doubly-upset by a Miami loss.

Yet I look this morning and I chose Miami. Argh. And I'm tied for #1.

Well, whoever else is at 11 wins, good luck tonight.
