The United States should pull the plug on funding for radio and television
broadcasts into Cuba, Democratic US Senator Russell Feingold urged President
Barack Obama in a letter released Wednesday.

"We remain committed to helping the people of Cuba strive for freedom of press,
speech, and other basic human rights" said Feingold, but "cannot afford" to
pursue programs that are "wasteful and potentially counterproductive."

Feingold pointed to a January 2009 report by the Government Accountability
Office (GAO), the non-partisan investigative arm of the US Congress, that found
Radio and TV Marti reach just a tiny audience in Cuba.

"Specifically, less than two percent of respondents to telephone surveys since
2003 reported tuning in to Radio or TV Marti during the past week," said the
GAO, which underlined that audience data are imperfect.

GAO also said it was "unclear" whether ambitious US efforts to overcome or skirt
the communist Cuban government's jamming of the outlets' signals were
succeeding.

Feingold said the United States could save nearly 300 million dollars over the
next ten years by scrapping the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which manages Radio
and TV Marti.
