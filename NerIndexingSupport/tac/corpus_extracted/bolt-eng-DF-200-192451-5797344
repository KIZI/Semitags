AMSTERDAM (Sept 22, 2011): Dutch politician Geert Wilders said yesterday he wanted the Netherlands to hold a referendum on whether to ban minarets, following a similar move by Switzerland.

Wilders told parliament he would propose a law paving the way for a referendum on minarets, but did not give details. Switzerland banned the construction of new minarets in 2009, a move that drew international condemnation at the time.

The Netherlands' reputation as relatively easy on immigration has changed over the past decade, reflecting voter concerns over the large number of Muslim immigrants, mainly from Morocco and Turkey.

The Dutch government last week said it will ban face-covering veils worn by some Muslim women because these flout the Dutch way of life and culture, and make it difficult to recognise people in public.

The new measures reflect the influence wielded by Wilders, whose anti-Islam, anti-immigration Freedom Party is the third-largest in parliament and the minority coalition government's chief ally.

Wilders has a pact with the minority coalition government to provide crucial support in parliament in exchange for tougher policies on Islam and immigration from non-Western countries.

Few Muslim women in the Netherlands wear the Arabic-style niqabs which leave the eyes uncovered and Afghan-style burqas that cover the face with a cloth grid. Academics estimate the numbers at between 100 and 400, whereas Muslim headscarves which leave the face exposed are far more common.

What a great idea, do you think the UK should follow ?  
 
 
Another thread to do with muslims!! you obviously have too much time
 
 
Good I wish we had a referendum on the Burka and Minarets here, I hope we have a referendum on Muslim immigration.
 
 
Pretty sure the OP has some kind of fetish for all things to do with Islam

Sorry sir  
 
 
These idiotic proposals are just a waste of time. Get to the damn point already and run a vote on banning Islam. Let's face it this is where people like Wilders want it to go. Lets have it out and see how far backwards our society has gone
 
 
the hell is a minaret?
 
 
Minarets are ****ing ugly. That is as far as my views on the subject go.

No, islam is a backward culture and he wants to stop it.
 
 
As long as minarets are safe and not an eye saw, let people do as they please.

Religion is stupid, but stopping people from "doing" their religious crap, is quite obviously an invasion of their civil liberties.
 
 
When I clicked on this thread I thought the Dutch wanted to ban a type of church tower... how wrong I was...
 
 
It's bizarre how normal this all feels now. It seems like every day there are anti-Muslim proposals like this being made in the Western World: 'the land of enlightenment.'
 
 
Oh for God's sake, you'd think a financial crisis would be sufficient to 'irrational fear' complex of most people's brains at this point, but apparently we have room to squeeze in a bit of religious paranoia too, so at least that exceeds my expectations. Incidentally, that is now the only thing about the brain of any given person that exceeds my expectations.

You've got a point.

Banning a building does not tackle the actual problem (belief that backward things are OKed by an absolute deity, but that's another debate) it just makes people feel pissed off and isolated.
 
 
The thing is, it is currently not legal to broadcast the call to prayer from minarets in Britain and most other European countries, so why are mosques nationwide being built with 20/30m high minarets? Answer: because they can, it's to show a large presence.
 
 
Are the minarets used for calls of prayer?

If not, why are they getting banned? Double standards.

Any society that judges the majority by the minority is backwards. The majority of Muslims are not terrorists.

This has nothing to do with terrorism. It has everything to do with Europeans rejecting, a barabric, primitive, non-progressive, misogynistic, homophobic ultra conservative religion that offers nothing of value to European society
 
 
Seems like Geert Wilders wanting publicity for his anti-islamic views. When is the next Dutch regional or national election?
 
 
Not a great idea, its already becoming a powder keg and its probably only going to get worse.
 
 
 
As long as minarets are safe and not an eye saw, let people do as they please.

 

Mate, all buildings built after the Victorian age are eye sores.

The Dutch are not tough on 'non-Western immigrants...

I am een niet-Westerse allochtoon (a non-Western foreigner) working in the Netherlands.

I only registered with the stadseel (municipality) today, even though I have been working here since March (which is technically illegal).

I am not required to be proficient in Dutch for the next 3 years.

I can wear my traditional dress to work (kurta etc.) and am not required or even expected to wear Western clothes when working/socializing.

I am subjected to less tax (on the same gross salary) than both my Dutch counterparts and foreigners of Western origin.
 
 
 
Any society that judges the majority by the minority is backwards. The majority of Muslims are not terrorists.

 

Who talks about terrrorists ?  

Its about a culture that treats women, gays, non believers and apostates like 6th class citizens and thats what makes it backward.

If not, why are they getting banned? Double standards.

 

Some are. And it isnt double standard. They represent a horrible culture which should have no place in any country that calls itself civilised.

That's your opinion. You cant be for freedoms only when if it suits you. That's what you're doing going by your statement. Therefore it is exactly double standards.

But if it's the call to prayer that's disturbing people, then fair enough.
 
 
I say ban the construction of any religious places of worship over a certain height so they do not impose on the skyline.
 
 
TBH this is by far the least controversial propsal Wilders has in mind for the muslim community in the Netherlands >_>
 
 
One step further to eradicating a place for them to worship yes. Mwuhahahahah
 
 
 
It has everything to do with Europeans rejecting, a barabric, primitive, non-progressive, misogynistic, homophobic ultra conservative religion that offers nothing of value to European society

 

Those same Europeans that would never ban Christianity to the same extent, would they? Despite the fact that there are people out there who use Christianity in exactly the same way.

Banning an architectural feature is petty nonsense. Would they ban Church spires, Cathedral towers? They wouldn't dare.
 
 
How long till he proposes Muslims wearing some sort of symbol? Being forbidden from certain jobs?
 
 
Muslim shouldnt be here at all. We shouldnt help Muslim countries we should take nothing to do with them. Unless we need Oil then we perform a massive curb stomp on one of them take it and get on with it

What do you mean exactly the same way ? I am not talking about Islamic terrorism.

I know, but you're talking about people who take an extreme view of Islam and try to live by it, and that can then bring on the "barbaric, primitive, non-progressive, misogynistic, homophobic ultra conservative" views, but that's absolutely no different to some followers of Christianity who have exactly the same views. However, the attempts that are being made to restrict Islam would never be made on Christians. It's beyond hypocritical.

  yes we scheme and plan to show our presence don't we because we have nothing else in our lives.

  how lame, I'm actually going to remember this every time I see a minaret from now on.

Christianity is simply not an issue. I live in a traditionally christian country and I would choose to live in a christian society over a Muslim one anyday, and I am an atheist. I would choose a christian society for many reasons. I do not for one moment believe that Muslims if they hypothetically became a majority, would treat us with any degree of the equality and tolerance western socities have shown them. If Muslims were the majority other minorities would be pushed down to the status of underclass.

The rank hypocrisy and, frankly, racism directed at the overwhelming majority of perfectly normal people is the issue here.

What does a minaret do that a church spire doesn't? These kind of laws only serve to force a wedge in the communities and make it harder for people of different backgrounds to get along.

Muslims are a collective threat because they follow one ideology, as the Muslim population grows larger in proportion to the native population they accumulate more power in regards to influencing political, social and legal affairs. As does the segregation of many communities. It isnot as simple as saying 'how can you generalise'.

And The issue is not the minaret per se it is growing Islam, I cannot understand why you are incapable of figuring that out.

So where did the enlightenment come from, who helped to usher it in?
Islam is however, a political tool, and not a religion. But that is the same as Catholicism, and even the protestant religion, which emerged roughly the same time as the industrial revolution in Europe.
 
 
 
"agree that you're a bigotted moron" yes.

 

Yeah because disliking a biggoted religion makes me biggoted.  

A religion where it followers would not extend the same tolerance and equality to us as we have them.

At least you have learned islam is not a race and you have stepped down from screaming 'racist' racist'.
 
 
 
Good lord...  

 

Sorry to wade in here (for the record, my view is that the ban is antagonistic and petty)

Sunni Islam is a centralised system of beliefs, (What the Grand Mufti says-is law, it doesn't matter if you live in Afganistan or the UK). When you look at the way in which (for example) gays are treated in the middle east, if Muslims held a majority in Europe, the same sort of thing which happens in the middle east could easily happen here. I'm not saying that it will, afterall, many Muslims are nice, reasonable people in spite of their religion, but crowd mentality can do bad things to the reasoning of good people...

I wouldn't classify Christianity as progressive personally. Islam is a fast growing religion and thus it doesn't need to change itself to attract new followers. Many christianity denominatiosn are however experiencing the problem of diminishing numbers of followers, especially in Western nations and thus are being forced to adapt to changing themselves for society to preserve their institutes.

Historically true, but in the present time right now, Europe is no longer in the dark ages and the Islamic golden age has ended. I think right now the present is more important than the past.

Some. That's the word you missed there. Some Christianity is progressive. Heard of the Amish? Heard of evangelicals? Each religion has a minority of nutters that let the side down. Just because some people who claim to be muslim blow themselves - and others - up, does not mean that is representative of the larger religion.

Christianity progressed in the 17th, 18th, 19th centuries when there was no falling demographic. Infact the demographic of Christians at that time exploded

islam is a fast growing religion not because it attracts new followers but because practitioners have huge families 5+ or 10+ being normal. chritianity is based in the west where people have 1 or 2 children, so numbers are mostly decreasing. in addition the punishment in islam for apostasy is death - so wanting to leave gets you a death penalty. when i went from Christianity to atheism, nothing happened, even my catholic parents didnt mind. - so i would say what your are saying is wrong as you are misinterpreting the evidence.

I am speaking about islam, sunni, shia etc.

The 17th century was a period in which the Enlightenment started making challanges towards Christianity. The Enlightenment brought with it great social changes and the church had to adapt to keep up with society.

Christianity also experienced an 'explosion' during these periods as colonialism was taking place. Missionaries were being sent to places as far away as the Philippines, Nigeria and Argentina. Colonialism is hardly progressive...

I fully agree with you, but the guy just talks like a racist. He has no respect for anyone's culture but his own. He talks as if there are no liberal-islamist who were and are still being oppressed. He sees what he wants to see, not the truth, so I feel that it is right I mention it.

Calm down.   I did skim the pages, but couldn't find the exact reason why people are so opposed to minarets. It's just an architectural feature.

I never stated that Islam attracts new followers. I said it is growing. I thought that it was obvious that Islam is based in countries which have large growing populations and so it need not be mentioned. The mere fact that it is based in countries with growing populations means that it doesn't need to change to attract new followers....as I have already stated. So by telling me that Islamic countries have a growing population and Christian populations are falling is actually in agreement with my original post.

The fact that Islam is growing, as I have stated, means that it need not change to preserve itself. Therefore it need not progress. You talk about punishment that are used in some Islamic communities as proof. I said that Christianity is only 'progressing' not because it is progressive but because it needs to preserve itself. Therefore, niether are progressive.

Because, having your own belief in how to do things, does not make someone else's culture BS, and I am not a Muslim by the way.

There's already planning restrictions on the dimensions of minarets, most of them are small in Holland anyway.
 
 
 
 

oh yeh, hideous..

 

I personally don't find them attractive. I think they look fine for the middle east, but here, no. Each country should retain its own customs, I have no problem with minarets as long as they're built in a Western context, like they could use towers built in the shape of castle towers. I don't know why they need to look Arabian.

Yes I know

 

Religious organisations were great supporters as colonialism was in their interest. They went to these countries and tried to force their religion upon the peoples.

Christianity has not made any proactive drives towards progression, rather, they have limped along and tried to keep up with society.
 
 
 
Because, having your own belief in how to do things, does not make someone else's culture BS, and I am not a Muslim by the way.

 

so you think it those punishments are completely fine and should be encourged, and he is wrong to think that they are BS. i dont care if you are a muslim or not. i care about what you are saying. ie its fine to mistreat people as long as its part of your 'culture'.

Seriously what the hell?

It's concerning that this kind of blatant infringement of religious freedoms, but of course only for some religions, is becoming normal on the continent. Minarets are absolutely harmless, and there is no ground to ban them other than unfounded prejudice.

I seriously hope the UK doesn't follow the same path as France, Switzerland, Belgium & the Netherlands when it comes to their full fronted assault on Islam. It serves no purpose and only further alienates the communities that we want to integrate into society. Thankfully I think our mainstream political parties are intelligent enough to understand that.

Europe is better off without Islam this is undeniable. Islam offers Europe nothing of value.

Not at all, I just do not believe in imperialism; a lot of western states are cool with it, until it begins to affect their money. I do believe that extremism is wrong, however, there are liberal-islamits, who believe the same thing.

That is not the point. its is barbaric to prejudice one religion against others. it is not right to ban just minarets. either ban all religious towers or none.

Yep, look terrible.

I actually find them quite pretty, but that's besides the point. Architecture and towns evolve, we can retain the old whilst building the new in an appropriate manner. Not to mention minarets are subject to exactly the same planning regulations as any other building, so obviously in picturesque villages they're not going to be built in a way that would seriously upset the image of the town.

It's not like Riyadh sized minarets are going to suddenly start appearing in alpine villages for crying out loud.

 
Europe is better off without Islam this is undeniable. Islam offers Europe nothing of value.

 

You're missing the point. Governments shouldn't be dictating correct and incorrect lifestyles, and in banning and targeting symbols particular to one lifestyle they're effectively doing that and thus undermining the principles of liberal democracy that modern Europe is built on.

It is very ironic when ethno-nationalists try to 'defend' European values and in doing so completely ignore and undermine them.
 
 
 
"Islam is a fast growing religion and thus it doesn't need to change itself to attract new followers." - forgive me, but this implies islam is getting new followers despite not changing. you should reconsider your wording

 

Maybe I could of worded it better. One would measure reilgions by their numbers of followers they have.

A 'new follower' would be someone joining the religion. A 'new follower' would count a new born child born into a religion as well as adult converts. Every new child born into a religion increases the religions total number of followers and so do converts. Islam therefore has a large growth of internal 'new followers' through high child birth rates. Therefore, since it has this internal growth, it doesn't need to change itself to attract external 'new followers'.

I don't know if that makes things anymore clearer or more confusing?
 
 
 
Not at all, I just do not believe in imperialism; a lot of western states are cool with it, until it begins to affect their money. I do believe that extremism is wrong, however, there are liberal-islamits, who believe the same thing.

 

you said he was prejudiced because he didnt agree with their 'culture'. i mentioned some things that are a part of their culture. now you are changing the topic. so do you agree that he is not prejudiced? if not please explain why he is prejudiced, i still didnt hear a coherent argument.
 
 
 
Colonialism was not driven by religion. However I am not going to discuss colonialism has it has nothing to do with this thread.

 

I never said they drove colonialism..... I said they supported....two different things.

You were discussing how Christianity progressive and Islam isn't progressive and I disagreed. You mentioned how Christianity was progressive in the 17th and 18th century, and I said they were supporting colonialism during this period.

i understand what you are saying and agree.
 
 
 
Pretty sure the OP has some kind of fetish for all things to do with Islam  

 

Islamophilia. Nice step away from islamophobia though isn't it.  

It's a shame he dosn't know that Islam is against Pork etc......... Maybe OP should stop beating his meat off to a niqab or boob shaped minaret.

lol, are you for real ? I have not seen a post were he does not profess a notion of white superiority, all these issues about culture is important. You talk as if there are no liberal-islamist. He said that islam is backwards, so what about the liberal-islamist, are they not Muslim?

Or am I missing something, just because I cannot be bothered with you, do not assume its because I have nothing to say. I am just bored, you will not change your views, and I will not accept your BS.

This is islamphobia!! It is deeply bigoted what are you people are saying, are there no extremist Christians ?

yes i agree that his european / white superiority is vile. and so is prejudice against muslims. however the issues of death penalties and mutilations are not though up by muslims, they are written in their book. i would say that if someone disagrees with what they believe is the literal word of god they cease to be a believer in a meaningful way. therefore a muslim in any sense of the word supports these penalties, because they were set down by god who said they are just and deserving.a muslim should obey him, or do i have the wrong idea? he said is islam is backward because of these punishments (i assume) and you say he is prejudiced. again please point me to the prejudice. i despise prejudice. and yes there are extremists of all religions did i mention support for any?

i suppose a good point would be that most jews dont agree with the penalties described in judaism which are very similar to islamic ones. yet i would still agree that someone is a jew despite not agreeing with these punishments. therefore i would agree that it is bigotry and prejudice to say every muslim supports these punishments. - but to call someone prejudiced and islamophobic for having a problem with these punishments is stupid.

There is not point of talking to you, I am not replying again. It is not what one says, but rather the motivations which makes one says certain things. He is racist because he bunches people together, if you have researched the Qur’an like I have, you would understand that it talks a lot about forgiveness, and having restraint not to take revenge. You see it through one light, yet you do not take the other side into account. The last time I checked, you could not give an academic evaluation without this.

The Sheriah laws were created by scholars, were they not? They are their interpretations of the Qur’an. Why are they backwards, on which grounds are “you” allowed to justify and decide how society should be. Surely, what you believe is merely a reflection of you socialisation? You are trying to talk as if you have intelligence, this is not an intelligent argument, and you have an inability to be objective.
 
 
 
Seriously what the hell?

It's concerning that this kind of blatant infringement of religious freedoms, but of course only for some religions, is becoming normal on the continent. Minarets are absolutely harmless, and there is no ground to ban them other than unfounded prejudice.

I seriously hope the UK doesn't follow the same path as France, Switzerland, Belgium & the Netherlands when it comes to their full fronted assault on Islam. It serves no purpose and only further alienates the communities that we want to integrate into society. Thankfully I think our mainstream political parties are intelligent enough to understand that.

 

This isn`t full fronted assaults on Islam. Its standing up for whats right.
 
 
 
liberal-islamist?

 

Edit: I went and checked the actual definition of islamist, and it seems I was wrong and you were right, sorry Millz :3.

I believe it is the sovereign right of any nation to do as it wishes. Democracy is not the holy grail of everybody-gets-what-they-want. Actually, it's just the fairest way for the majority to get what it wants. If the majority want to ban Burkas or Minarets then they are allowed to do so.
 
 
 
Doesn't the term Islamist refer to the faction of Islam that is anti-western -dominance?
Do you mean liberal-Muslim?
Of course there are liberal Muslims, there's liberal anything, but while they're in the minority it really doesn't matter, because the majority of Muslims worldwide are more conservative than they are liberal.

I'll bet the majority of liberal Muslims are those who've been exposed to western culture as well.
Now I am not a racist, or a white supremacist, nor do I hold any religion in higher regard than any other.

In Islam liberal muslims are actually the worst. I think they are being refered to as "hypocrites".

the talk of forgiveness doesnt excuse the talk of mutilations.
i say death penalties for apostasy and sexual preference are wrong because i wouldnt want to have those penalties applied to me, its called empathy and the golden rule. on what grounds are they right in the first place?

Of course they would be, why do they have to adopt western culture. They do not believe in Sheriah law stoning and such things, but they do not wish to adopt western values. They wish to progress and come up with their own ideas. All this is admirable, independent thought and ideas is a means for progression. They do not wish to attack the west, but rebut western imperialism. Good on them I say.

They have the right to generate and refine their own ideas, change happens in time. You can not achieve change by cultural imperialism and expect it to work, come on!!

You are just trying to be difficult.

were the germans right to generate and refine their own ideas in the 1930s and 40s? why not? ( i would be really surprised if you said they were)

you can generate your own ideas as long as it doesnt stop others from generating theirs. i think death pretty much stops your ability to produce ideas, or should generating ideas not be allowed for homosexuals and apostates? so im not entirely sure some of their ideas were all that great.

It was their right to do so, however, that this is were "von clausewitz" comes in, war is politics by other means. If someone does something does something which effects you, you have the right to use force. What you do not have a right to do, the problem with the west is, they do not practice what they preach. They profess liberalism, and a notion that terrorism is bad, yet they practice state founded terrorism, the attempted coup d'état in Venezuela, supported by the CIA, is a perfect example.

So why, when other state choose their own practices, do you complain. Because the west has avoided revolutions and uprisings for a long time by exporting is bloodshed. "If we show that our way is the only way, nobody will reject it", seems to be the notion behind the whole project. But I am tired now, you probably cannot understand the relevance of what I just said.

well the i agree with the very last thing you said. i dont see how what you said is relevant. im also unaware i expressed support for western, what you call, 'exported bloodshed'. im sure you will be happy to know i dont. if a smoker tells you to stop smoking, should you not listen to him?

well killing of european jews didnt affect americans, nor did the killing of Chinese by japan. was america wrong to interve? should america have not intervened because they had previously massacred the native americans? also im not quite sure if you said that it was ok for germans to institute anti-semitism as long as they did it withing germany. if the dutch institute anti-islamism in netherlands how is that different? you are the one that said they should be allowed to generate ideas. why can islamic country have homophobia while the netharlands cant ban minarets?

True, but when politics is all about power, power structured relationships, become very important.

Well, if you are talking about the Second World War, then they had a vested interest. It is about power, after Europe, what you Hitler do next? You stick with you allies, and those who you share common ground with. You are talking about a time, when liberal values where still deeply entrenched in America, the war against fascism, carried with it a political agenda. It was a war of ideologies, and thus, power and dominance.

The Americans joined in the war against Japan, because they attacked them. They had interests in the Far East. Trading routes which are very important, they came in to protect their cash. Now, that is the same reason way they carry military exercises with Japan, funny enough, now a days to keep China in check.

could you answer these questions, im extremely curious to how you will reply.

was ok for germans to institute anti-semitism as long as they did it within germany. if the dutch institute anti-islamism in netherlands how is that different? you are the one that said they should be allowed to generate their own ideas. why can islamic country have homophobia while the netharlands cant ban minarets?
should the only reason to stop genocide be because of 'vested economic and political interest'?

- to me it sounds like you are ok with discrimination (even support it, wtf?) except when it applies to muslims, perhaps reconsider your views before calling others prejudiced?

Not at all, in history, your learn from the past and the past mistakes. Thus, you do not repeat them. That was a different time, the wave of globalisaton then, as very minimal. People were a lot more igorant, to be enlightened and not use the knowledge, what would that make you ?

It should not because of "vested economics interests", but history has shown that is often the reason why.

I believe in liberty and fairness btw.

Well, western history anyway.

I would think a fool, if you follow my logic

What uni do you go, and what degree do you read ?
 
 
so muslims shouldnt be allowed to kill homosexuals and apostates?

if you say

-they should not - then that contradicts what you said before, about generation of their own ideas and implementing and developing them as they wish and not 'exporting' western values

- if you say they should - how are people prejudiced for having a problem with these acts?

i am applying for chemistry. you?

Lol, you are really trying to catch me out. But, like I said, it is western thought, it is not their thought, at least, they practice what they preach.

like Malcolm x said "i respect a man who is wrong but says what he thinks, than a man who comes like a angel and is nothing but a devil". Western politics always practices self interests, what is wrong with them doing the same?

lol you dont 'adopt' history. history was, and it was in a particular way, there is only one history. (you can have your own views on it )

with regards to beliefs. you can have any that you want - you can believe in slavery or that hitler was a great man (if you are willing to sink that low) but you have no right to prevent me having my own beliefs. the problem is that they feel they have the right to impose their belief. when i say this is wrong, you call me prejudiced and islamophobic. that is the heart of our recent discussion.

i repeat: do you respect hitler? he said and did what he thought was right. are you really trying to say that there was nothing wrong with that?

There is only one history, hahaha, everything is contested mate!!!

There are popular views, and some on the fringes.

Hitler was looking for power, he did what he did to achieve that. It was not in the interests of the other western states, so the stopped him.

sad how you dont see the hypocrisy of claiming murders of apostates and homosexuals is justified - because it reflects the ruling majority's will, while claiming the banning of minarets is not, even though it is also the ruling majority's will. you look like an idiot and a hypocrite.

its funny how you refuse to condemn hitlers genocide, a good indicator that your views are wrong and immoral is that they support hitler, i encourage you to reconsider them.
 
 
Not surprised.
Today banning minarets and tomorrow asking Muslims to wear "I am a Muslim sign".
Muslim-bashing- normal now....

If there were a vote tomorrow in Islamic countries to ban churches, you can bet your bottom dollar it would pass with 90% of Muslims voting for it.
