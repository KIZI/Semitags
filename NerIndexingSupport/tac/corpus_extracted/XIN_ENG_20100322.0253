Brazilians have become more optimistic about the country's job market and
employment prospects, a survey released Monday by the National Confederation of
Industry (CNI) said.

A CNI indicator that measures Brazilian workers' fear of unemployment decreased
15.7 percent year-on-year to 82 points in March, the lowest level since the
survey started in 2003.

The figure decreased 4.1 percent from the previous study, which was carried out
in December.

According to the CNI, 53 percent of the 2,002 respondents said they were not
afraid of losing their jobs, the first time that over half of those surveyed
said so.

However, the share of Brazilian workers who said they were somewhat afraid of
unemployment rose to 32 percent from 31 percent in December, while the workers
who were very afraid of unemployment totaled 15 percent, down from 19 percent in
December.

Brazilian workers believe that the impact of the international financial crisis
on the Brazilian economy has come to an end, which indicates that the indicator
will remain low, CNI economist Marcelo Azevedo said.
