TAMPA  They made their first cigar in Tampa in 1902.
      In July, they will make their last.

A piece of Tampa history was extinguished Tuesday when the
parent company of Hav-A-Tampa cigars announced it will close its
local production plant, near E Broadway Avenue, leaving almost 500
employees jobless.

"It's not just us. It's everybody in the business," said Rick
McKenzie, senior vice president of human resources for Altadis
U.S.A. "Is there an easy answer? I don't know of one."

The company will continue to make the Hav-A-Tampa brand in
Puerto Rico, McKenzie said.

McKenzie blamed the closure on government policies that group
cigarettes, chewing tobacco and cigars under the label of tobacco
and increasingly regulate them all.

He said the one that really hurt came in April when a federal
tobacco tax hike took effect to pay for the State Children's Health
Insurance Program.

A 5-cent tax was bumped up to about 40 cents on large cigars,
with a lesser increase for smaller cigars. The money provides
health insurance to 11 million low-income children.

When Hav-A-Tampa opened more than 100 years ago, Tampa was known
as Cigar City.

"For a long time, because of the word Tampa being in the name
of the company, they were synonymous not only with cigars but
Tampa-made cigars," said Rodney Kite-Powell, curator at the Tampa
Bay History Center.

"They were one of the few companies started early on that was
owned by American-born businessmen, and they also were one of the
first companies to bring machines into the factories," he said.
"That kind of revolutionized the business for good or for bad,
depending on who you ask."

The company, also the makers of Tampa Nugget, Tampa Sweet and
Phillies cigars, was locally owned until 1997, when Tabacalera of
Madrid, Spain's largest tobacco company, bought it.

Two years later, Tabacalera merged with a French tobacco giant
to form Altadis S.A.

The two companies combined cigar operations to create Altadis
U.S.A., and England's Imperial Tobacco bought it in 2008.

The closure of Hav-A-Tampa means just one sizable cigar-making
factory remains in Tampa: J.C. Newman Cigar Co., with about 150
employees.

"We're the last of the Mohicans," said Bobby Newman, company
executive vice president.

"It's a sad day for Tampa," Newman said. "Tampa used to be
the cigar capital of the world, and Hav-A-Tampa was a big player in
the industry."

Local retail cigar businesses say the tax has hurt them, too.

At Ybor Cigars Plus, Paula Moreno let eight employees go this
year. "That's eight families," she said. "If we close, it's 15
employees. That's 15 families with no income."

She has reduced her work force but added entertainment. Live
music helps. New drink specials written on notebook paper stand on
tables next to thick, glass ashtrays.

And there's increasing Ybor competition. A block away,
NicaHabana Cigars opened less than a month ago.

Tobacco is all Maria Galeano knows. Her father farmed it. She
has worked in factories since she was 16. But her hours at her last
cigar job were cut down to 20 a week. She needs to support herself,
five children and a pregnant daughter-in-law. Money for a house
went to the new business.

And so, the unsteady industry moves on, leaving behind the
Hav-A-Tampa factory. The nondescript industrial building on Riga
Boulevard is so far east of Ybor City, it is nearly in Brandon. And
the brand that once made its hometown synonymous with cigars puts
out the light on a period of Tampa history as rich as a hand-rolled
corona.

McKenzie said employees weren't surprised about the closing but
by how soon it came.

Stephen Villane started packing cigars in the Hav-A-Tampa
factory more than two years ago.

"It's just been downhill," Villane said. "The tobacco
industry's frowned upon. Everyone knew what was going to happen."
