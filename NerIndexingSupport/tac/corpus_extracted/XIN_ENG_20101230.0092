Pakistan has decided Thursday to go legal battle for officials of its
intelligence agency Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI), who had been summoned by
a U.S. court in response to a lawsuit filed by relatives of two American victims
of 2008 Mumbai attacks accusing them of providing material support for the
attacks.

In November, the summons were issued by a New York court to ISI ' s chief, Lt.
Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, and other officials, and also to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)
commander Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi and Jamaat-ud Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, accused to
be the masterminds of the attacks in the Indian business hub.

"The Government of Pakistan has taken a firm decision to strongly contest the
suit filed against the ISI, its present and past Directors General," said the
Foreign Ministry.

"The Government of Pakistan and the Pakistan Embassy in Washington shall defend
the legal suit on behalf of ISI and its Directors General fully and properly,"
the Ministry said in a statement.

Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani has also stated in the National
Assembly that "We do not believe the ISI, as an agency of the Government of
Pakistan, or its present and former officials could be subjected to civil
litigation in the courts of the United States and we intend to take appropriate
steps to obtain dismissal of this action."

The 26-page lawsuit was filed before a Brooklyn court last week by family
members of Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg and his pregnant wife, Rivka, who were
among the 166 people killed in the attacks. Their son Moshe was saved by his
Indian nanny in the tragedy.

The suit alleges that ISI "provided critical planning, material support, control
and coordination for the attacks" to the Pakistan- based militant group LeT,
which has been blamed for the 26/11 siege. The LeT is also named in the suit.

Besides Pasha, who has been the director general of the ISI since September
2008, the court has also summoned his predecessor, Lt. Gen. Nadeem Taj and ISI
officials Major Samir Ali, Azam Cheema and Major Iqbal.

Pakistan has denied any involvement and also arrested several persons including
LeT commander Lakhvi.
