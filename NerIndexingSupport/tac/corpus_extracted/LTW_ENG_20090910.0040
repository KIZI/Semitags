An imposing figure with a shaved head, the Sacramento resident is a
benevolent but firm dictator, a role that dovetails nicely with his day job
as a corrections officer. He's the final authority on who's in, who's out,
who goes on the important missions called raids and who gets the best
in-game rewards.

"We are a small tribe and he is the alpha," says Portland, Ore.,
resident Casey Aron.

Dread Pirate veteran Josh Schweitzer has a request for the captain
tonight. The guild typically starts playing at 7:30 p.m. and raids last
until midnight. That's too late for Schweitzer, who starts the day with his
son at 5 a.m. He's hopeful that a group  occasionally could split off and
start playing earlier.

"No,"  Gorman replies abruptly. "That's too many people. Imagine the
logistics."

Schweitzer defers to his leader with a shrug.

"It's just too bad because I can't raid with my friends."
