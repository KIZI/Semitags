The woman was sincere. And completely wrong.

She was among the dozens of protesters outside a Tuesday hearing about
President Obama's plan to move Guantanamo detainees to a prison in Thomson,
Ill. The woman, identified by the Associated Press as Amanda Norms, worried
that if Guantanamo detainees were relocated to Thomson, "terrorists would
want to hit us to make a point, in the Midwest, in the American
heartland."

Certainly terrorists always try to make a point. That's why they struck
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon -- the financial and military symbols
of the country. That's why they tried to strike at the U.S. Capitol. And, by
that logic, it's not unthinkable that these craven thugs would use the
presence of a prison that houses some of their alleged comrades as a pretext
for launching an attack nearby.

But to suggest that keeping the prison out of Illinois would keep that
part of the country safe is ignoring reality. And, in fact, there are strong
arguments that shuttering Guantanamo and moving detainees to the United
States may make us all safer.

The heartland is not immune to terrorism. Nor is anywhere else. That's
not meant to frighten. It's simply true. Plots have been thwarted that
either originated in or targeted landmarks in Colorado, Florida, New York,
New Jersey, North Carolina, California, Georgia and, yes, Illinois. Ali
Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student in Peoria when he was arrested in 2001
and identified as an al-Qaida operative who had met with Osama bin Laden and
trained at one of his notorious camps. More recently, an Illinois man and
would-be mujahid was apprehended after a failed attempt to blow up a federal
building in the capital city of Springfield.

So keeping terrorism suspects out of Illinois wouldn't eliminate the
terrorist threat. But holding suspects in a U.S. facility and prosecuting
them in federal courts or in the much-improved military commissions would
give the United States a chance to start wiping out horrendous images of
torture and abuse and to prove that all suspects -- Muslim or otherwise --
will be treated fairly. Terrorists would no longer be able to point to Gitmo
as "proof" of America's enmity toward all Muslims. And the power of one of
their most successful recruiting tools would be eliminated.
