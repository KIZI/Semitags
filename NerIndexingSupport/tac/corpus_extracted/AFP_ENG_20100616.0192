Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz recreated scenes from their new film
"Knight and Day" before hundreds of fans in Seville ahead of its world premiere
on Wednesday night.

In a promotional event, the two repeated a motorcycle stunt near the city's
landmark cathedral, which they originally performed during filming of a chase
scene that is one of the highlights of the action-comedy movie.

"We had a great time together, he is the best to work with" Diaz told ABC news
in New York from Seville just before they performed the stunt.

"He is the king of stunts, he does nearly everything you see in the movie, it is
him jumping from one building to the next, he is not wearing a wire, he is
running on rooftops, he is jumping from car to car."

Cruise, 47, and Diaz, 37, filmed key scenes of the action-comedy movie in
Seville as well as in the nearby coastal city of Cadiz last year.

The movie opens in the United States on June 23 and across Europe over the
coming weeks.
