 
 
The Death of al-Zarqawi was staged by the U.S....
 
 
...in order to take the focus off Ann Coulter's insensitive and tasteless remarks about the 9-11 widows.

Think about it. Last night, Ann Coulter was probably getting death threats, and she was digging an even worse whole with every interview she did, being even more sickeningly unaware of the line she had crossed, and was still crossing...I mean, she was shamelessly going down in flames...and then, this morning, conveniently, this guy is killed. Yeah, right. What are the odds of this happening just, like, for no reason, right at the same time? You really expect me to believe that shit? Pffft!

That's right, I said it. It's a goddammed conspiracy, I tell ya.
 
 
Gee, that's hilarious Kickycan.
 
 
Why would the Bush admin care about Coulter's death threats?
 
 
Aw hell - now you're going to treat it like a serious proposal?
 
 
That's a good question, littlek. I believe it is because...BUSH AND COULTER HAVE BEEN SECRET LOVERS FOR YEARS.

Oh yeah, bank on it, missy. It's a fact, jack.
 
 
even I can't go there.

Now.

You are, of course, quite correct.

How could we have missed it?

They were made for each other.......

Does this mean the right have to get behind illicit sex?

I disagree. I think Bush's secret lover was his supreme court nominee, Harriet Meirs (the alleged 60-year-old virgin). That virgin thing was the perfect cover story. I mean, who would ever suspect that Bush was getting it on with a virgin? Bush and Harriet spent long hours together--consulting each other--and Laura didn't have to worry... you know, because of the virgin thing.
 
 
An interesting observation jickster. Im gonna have to run this by AMIGO, hes our official conspiracymeister.
 
 
I'm thinking the Bushies liked Coulter going down in flames. It gave everyone something harmless to vent their spleens on....
 
 
a horse faced bitch and a idiotic horses ass... a match made in heaven indeed....

The hate but no constructive critisism of the lady. She is indeed a harpy but nothing different then what the other side has as well.
 
 
I agree that Coulter probably serves a purpose for the Admin. She' so outrageous that it makes them seem almost reasonable.

I saw her "interviewed" by Cavuto on Fox News yesterday. He was worshipful and she was purring...

You know she was like this before this admin and will be like this afterwards. I don't think she has any special place in the Bush White House any more then Molly Ivins or the other liberal harpies did in the Clintion White House. Trust me there were plenty of them. :wink:
 
 
I'm sure she works quite independently of the White House, but I also think she's useful to them...
 
 
Condi's upset, she's suspected it for years but never knew for sure, but now that she has to travel so much there is so much time for her loverboy to stray and now Kicky has revealed all here.

She's taking the first plane home.

You may be right. Debra. But then why did they set this whole fake Zarqawi thing up? Oh, I know!

Maybe Ann Coulter somehow found out about it, and has some kind of proof of it that Bushie wouldn't want leaked.

So, obviously, when Ann was having this huge PR nightmare happen, she must have made a call to Georgie...and suddenly...whammo! Zarqawi is dead!

Conspiracy! Conspiracy!!!

Really? I thought it was Magginkat that had that market cornered. Either way, I'll topple them both with this one, or I'll die trying, dammit!!!

You're both wrong. It's Zippo.
 
 
You need to wake up, Kick... YOU'RE DREAMIN' ! ! !

You'll never even get close to Detano Inipo, Freedom4Free and Blueflame--them boys will believe anything.
 
 
See, we agree on another bunch of hallucinatory lunatics.

Now.
 

How about bu$h and Condi?

I think Condi would snap Bush in two if he ever looked like having such a thought.

Condi and Bush?

Here's the rumor:

 
Developing Story - Bush Marriage In Trouble Over Affair With Condi?
Reported by Ellen - June 03, 2006

With all the hoopla over Monicagate, why is the mainstream media ignoring this piece of news from ex-CIA agent, Wayne Madsen?

"A Mayflower Hotel staffer has confirmed that First Lady Laura Bush spent at least one night this past week at the hotel, which is four blocks north of the White House. Mrs. Bush reportedly moved out of the White House after a confrontation with President Bush over his on-going affair with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice." (June 3, 2006 post)

...A White House source, speaking on background, vehemently denied to WMR that there are marital problems between President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush over a reported extramarital affair between Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. However, two mainstream media sources have confirmed that their sources also have reported an ongoing affair between Mr. Bush and Rice. " (June 2, 2006 post)

Okay, I want to put a stop to this right now.

Gentlemen, please picture you are in a hot tub with Dr. Rice and Ann Coulter. Now, what do you want to have happen?

A) Have either one of them get out of the water exposing themselves to your sight or

B) do you just submerge yourself and try to drown as quickly as possible.

Joe(Sorry, you are not drunk, so there will be no excuses)Nation

Then again maybe Bush has really bad eyes.
 
 
Gotta say, I find both of those broads repulsive. Affairs with -? I'd rather not.
 
 
George and Condi? How unimaginative. It would be a much better story if it were Laura and Condi.
 
 
Zarqawi #2 (a letter to the editor from this morning's paper):

Catch-22 lives on:

Tony Blair's triumph at the death of Zarqawi was lifted straight from Joseph Heller's Catch-22. We got Zarqawi. Who's he? He's the bad guy from Iraq. But I thought that was Saddam. He was bad too, but we got rid of him. Who put him there in the first place? Who, Saddam? We did. No, who put Zarqawi there? Oh, they did. Who's they? Al-Qaeda. Who put them in? They came in after we got rid of Saddam. So we put them in. No, they weren't invited. So they invaded Iraq. No, we invaded. Were we invited? No. So neither of us was invited. No, Saddam wouldn't hear of it. So we got rid of Saddam so we both could come. No, so that we could come. Uninvited. Yes. Like Zarqawi  So it goes.

Yeh, I agree with that, though it's amusing for a bad blind date construct...
 
 
Eek! I said that before I read Debra's post. Well, I dunno. I can well understand needing a hotel stay whether or not the CIA agent's tale is true. and whether or not there was any partner at the hotel.

off your high horse cable guy  
 
 
What's really pathetic is that if tomorrow the world learned the the zarqawi killing was rigged and he was still alive ( and I'm not saying I believe that) no one would be particularly surprised.

no f**ked up thing this admninistration might actually do would be beyond the realm of belief.
 
 
Iraq militants claim al-Zarqawi is dead

Updated: 3:31 a.m. PT March 4, 2004
BAGHDAD, Iraq - A Jordanian extremist suspected of bloody suicide attacks in Iraq was killed some time ago in U.S. bombing and a letter outlining plans for fomenting sectarian war is a forgery, a statement allegedly from an insurgent group west of the capital said.

 http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4446084/ 
 
 
Something all previous claims of Zarqawi's demise do not have in common with the current report is a positively identifiied corpse complete with official death certificate.

Suicide attacks? Plural?

How feline.

True, true..

I realize this but I also feel that this kind of thing deserves to bee taken notice of in addition to the military information campaign of pumping up Zarqawi to be something he may not have been. If we really belive in a true healthy democracy that means a thinking and critical citizenry presented with all the information.

I am not really sugesting anything except to say "look at this".

"Some senior intelligence officers believe Zarqawi's role may have been overemphasized by the propaganda campaign, which has included leaflets, radio and television broadcasts, Internet postings and at least one leak to an American journalist."

 Link 

also I am not direspecting or trivializing the hard work, sacrafice and resources (or the blood, sweat and tears) our military has put into killing an enemy of this nature.

I have however said that the trust the President, the pentagon and the intelligence community have batrayed in the eyes of the people will come at a cost and is bad for the country and a deception of democracy.
