Wall Street investment giant Morgan Stanley announced Thursday that John Mack
would give up the position of chief executive, promoting co-president James
Gorman.

Mack, who was ousted from the firm in 2001 and returned in 2005, will retain the
title of chairman of Morgan Stanley, which weathered the financial crisis with
help from capital from Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG).

The CEO change will be effective January 1, and Gorman also will join Morgan
Stanley's board of directors at the end of the year.

The firm also announced that co-president Walid Chammah will become chairman of
Morgan Stanley International at year-end and will continue to be based in
London.

"Four years ago, we were extremely fortunate to be able to bring John Mack back
to Morgan Stanley, given everything he had done to build the firm and its global
franchise," said Robert Kidder, lead director of the board.

"Since then, John has provided invaluable leadership to the firm -- including,
most importantly, successfully guiding Morgan Stanley through last fall's
unprecedented financial crisis and positioning the firm to succeed in today's
reshaped market environment."

Kidder said Mack told the board 18 months ago thatÂ he would like to step back
from the CEO role after turning 65 this November.

The appointment of Gorman, 51, will "ensure a smooth and successful CEO
succession process," he added.

Like other major financial institutions, Morgan Stanley received government
capital as part of a program to steady the financial system.

In June it repaid the 10 billion dollars injected under the Capital Purchase
Program along with dividends from those shares and later paid 950 million
dollars for warrants associated with the program.
