One depressing aspect of American politics is the susceptibility
of the political and media establishment to charlatans. You might
have thought, given past experience, that D.C. insiders would be on
their guard against conservatives with grandiose plans. But no: as
long as someone on the right claims to have bold new proposals,
he's hailed as an innovative thinker. And nobody checks his
arithmetic.

Which brings me to the innovative thinker du jour: Rep. Paul
Ryan of Wisconsin.

Ryan has become the Republican Party's poster child for new
ideas thanks to his "Roadmap for America's Future," a plan for a
major overhaul of federal spending and taxes. News media coverage
has been overwhelmingly favorable; on Monday, The Washington Post
put a glowing profile of Ryan on its front page, portraying him as
the GOP's fiscal conscience. He's often described with phrases like
"intellectually audacious."

But it's the audacity of dopes. Ryan isn't offering fresh food
for thought; he's serving up leftovers from the 1990s, drenched in
flimflam sauce.

Ryan's plan calls for steep cuts in both spending and taxes.
He'd have you believe that the combined effect would be much lower
budget deficits, and, according to that Washington Post report, he
speaks about deficits "in apocalyptic terms." And The Post also
tells us that his plan would, indeed, sharply reduce the flow of
red ink: "The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Rep.
Paul Ryan's plan would cut the budget deficit in half by 2020."

But the budget office has done no such thing. At Ryan's request,
it produced an estimate of the budget effects of his proposed
spending cuts -- period. It didn't address the revenue losses from
his tax cuts.

The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has, however, stepped into the
breach. Its numbers indicate that the Ryan plan would reduce
revenue by almost $4 trillion over the next decade. If you add
these revenue losses to the numbers The Post cites, you get a much
larger deficit in 2020, roughly $1.3 trillion.

And that's about the same as the budget office's estimate of the
2020 deficit under the Obama administration's plans. That is, Ryan
may speak about the deficit in apocalyptic terms, but even if you
believe that his proposed spending cuts are feasible -- which you
shouldn't -- the Roadmap wouldn't reduce the deficit. All it would
do is cut benefits for the middle class while slashing taxes on the
rich.

And I do mean slash. The Tax Policy Center finds that the Ryan
plan would cut taxes on the richest 1 percent of the population in
half, giving them 117 percent of the plan's total tax cuts. That's
not a misprint. Even as it slashed taxes at the top, the plan would
raise taxes for 95 percent of the population.

Finally, let's talk about those spending cuts. In its first
decade, most of the alleged savings in the Ryan plan come from
assuming zero dollar growth in domestic discretionary spending,
which includes everything from energy policy to education to the
court system. This would amount to a 25 percent cut once you adjust
for inflation and population growth. How would such a severe cut be
achieved? What specific programs would be slashed? Ryan doesn't
say.

After 2020, the main alleged saving would come from sharp cuts
in Medicare, achieved by dismantling Medicare as we know it, and
instead giving seniors vouchers and telling them to buy their own
insurance. Does this sound familiar? It should. It's the same plan
Newt Gingrich tried to sell in 1995.

And we know, from experience with the Medicare Advantage
program, that a voucher system would have higher, not lower, costs
than our current system. The only way the Ryan plan could save
money would be by making those vouchers too small to pay for
adequate coverage. Wealthy older Americans would be able to
supplement their vouchers, and get the care they need; everyone
else would be out in the cold.

In practice, that probably wouldn't happen: older Americans
would be outraged -- and they vote. But this means that the supposed
budget savings from the Ryan plan are a sham.

So why have so many in Washington, especially in the news media,
been taken in by this flimflam? It's not just inability to do the
math, although that's part of it. There's also the unwillingness of
self-styled centrists to face up to the realities of the modern
Republican Party; they want to pretend, in the teeth of
overwhelming evidence, that there are still people in the GOP
making sense. And last but not least, there's deference to power --
the GOP is a resurgent political force, so one mustn't point out
that its intellectual heroes have no clothes.

But they don't. The Ryan plan is a fraud that makes no useful
contribution to the debate over America's fiscal future.
