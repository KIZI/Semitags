      CHINA-BRAIN-DRAIN (Beijing) -- China wants its scientists back.
Its leaders are determined to reverse the drain of top talent that
accompanied its opening to the outside world over the past three
decades. They have used their now ample financial resources -- and a
dollop of national pride -- to make it happen. One such star they
have lured back was a top molecular biologist who ran his own lab
at Princeton. By Sharon LaFraniere.

      AFGHAN-CIA-VICTIMS (Washington) -- In the days since an attack
killed undercover operatives of the CIA in Afghanistan - five men
and two women, including two private contractors for the firm
formerly known as Blackwater, and a CIA station chief who the
mother of three children - have begun to trickle out, despite the
secretive nature of their work. What emerges is a portrait of a
complex sliver of the spy agency on the front lines in one of the
most dangerous corners of the Earth. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and
Mark Mazzetti.

      BRITAIN-POLITICS (London) -- Months before a national election,
two senior leaders in Britain's governing Labour Party issued an
unusual appeal on Wednesday for a secret ballot on the leadership
of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, adding to a catalog of woes ranging
from recession at home to criticism of his handling of the war in
Afghanistan. The dissidents -- the former Cabinet ministers Patricia
Hewitt and Geoff Hoon -- said in a letter to Labour legislators,
many of whom could lose their jobs in the election, that the party
was "deeply divided" over Brown's leadership and that the issue
should be resolved "once and for all." By Alan Cowell.

      WASHINGTON

      DEMS-SENATE (Washington) -- The sudden retirement of two senior
Democratic senators facing tough reelection battles shook
Democratic leaders Wednesday and signaled that President Barack
Obama's party is facing a shifting and perilous political
environment that could hold major implications for this year's
midterm elections and his own agenda. The rapid change in fortunes
for Democrats, less than a year after taking office on the strength
of an historic Democratic sweep, was underscored by the
announcements that Sens. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and
Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota would rather retire their seats
than fight an uphill - and uncertain - battle toward re-election in
a year filled with difficult terrain for many incumbents. By Adam
Nagourney.

      HEALTHCARE-ABORTION-STUPAK (Menominee, Mich.) -- Profile of Rep.
Bart Stupak, D-Mich., the congressman who wrote the amendment to
the healthcare reform bill prevents women who receive federal
insurance subsidies from purchasing abortion coverage. By Jodi
Kantor.

      TERROR-PLANE-INDICT (Washington) -- A federal grand jury in
Michigan on Wednesday indicted a Nigerian man for the failed effort
to a Northwest Airlines jet bound from Amsterdam to Detroit on
Christmas Day. The six-count indictment charged Umar Farouk
Abdulmutallab, 23, with attempted murder on a plane, attempted use
of a weapon of mass destruction, and related offenses that would
carry a potential sentence, if he is convicted, of up to life in
prison. By Charlie Savage.

      CT-SENATE-DODD (East Haddam, Conn.) -- Christopher J. Dodd has
been in politics 36 years, including an ill-starred presidential
run in 2008 and a record three decades as a U.S. senator from
Connecticut. He can, then, count votes with anyone in Congress. But
with his popularity at a nadir after a year of damaging disclosures
and bungled responses, he was not sure he could count enough votes
in his home state to assure election to a sixth term. Dodd is also
65, and in the past year alone he has battled prostate cancer,
helped bury an older sister (his closest relative) and Edward M.
Kennedy (his closest friend in the Senate), and seen another former
colleague, Jon S. Corzine, go down to defeat after a nasty
re-election fight in New Jersey. By David M. Halbfinger.

      CT-SENATE-BLUMENTHAL (Undated) -- Richard Blumenthal, the popular
Connecticut attorney general, announced Wednesday that he would
seek the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Christopher J.
Dodd, suddenly altering the dynamic of an already volatile race.
Blumenthal, 62, was quickly endorsed by Democratic leaders from
Hartford, Conn., to Washington, who hope that his high name
recognition, untarnished reputation and popularity among voters
will allow them to defend the seat in November against a Republican
Party that had aggressively targeted Dodd for defeat. By Raymond
Hernandez and Alison Leigh Cowan.

      NY-GOV-SPEECH (Albany, N.Y.) -- In an unusually blunt address to
the Legislature on Wednesday, Gov. David A. Paterson chastised the
lawmakers before him for spending the state into fiscal near-ruin
and standing by as a plague of political corruption destroyed New
Yorkers' trust in their own government. Dispensing with the
ritualized flattery that typically precedes the annual State of the
State address, Paterson warned, in sometimes Biblical tones, that
lawmakers faced a political and financial reckoning if they did not
act quickly to repair New York's finances and restore citizens
faith in public officials. By Nicholas Confessore and Jeremy W.
Peters.

      CALIF-GOV-SPEECH (Sacramento, Calif.) -- His state strapped but
his legacy looming, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger Wednesday said he
would seek to greatly reduce the amount of money California spends
on its prisons, put the savings into the state's higher education
system and push for a law that would prohibit that percentage of
the state's budget earmarked for prisons to exceeding that set
aside for its public university system. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

      FLA-FREEZE (Tampa, Fla.) -- Icicles hang from the thermometer: 25
degrees, at dawn, and the strawberries that should be on cereal sit
suspended beneath hard ice, shiny and clear as lacquer. Michelle
Williamson smiles. The ice, she says, did its job of keeping the
plants safe, and the worst has been averted. Again. For now.
Tuesday brought the fourth consecutive night of freezing
temperatures and all-night watering to the nation's winter
strawberry capital, and with another cold front on its way, nearly
everyone here expects the frenzy and fatigue to continue. The good
news is that the current freeze, so far, has not been nearly as
damaging as the bitter cold snaps of 1835, 1962, or 1989, which
each destroyed dozens of businesses and altered breakfast menus
nationwide. The bad news is that its unusual length has already
begun to test the patience of nearly everyone who touches a
strawberry or wants to. By Damien Cave.

      FINANCIAL
      (Will move in "f" news file.)

      AUTOS-WEB-CONNECT (Undated) -- To the dismay of safety advocates
already worried about driver distraction, automakers and high-tech
companies have found a new place to put sophisticated
Internet-connected computers: the front seat. Technology giants
like Intel and Google are turning their attention from the desktop
to the dashboard, hoping to bring the power of the PC to the car.
They see vast opportunity for profit in partnering with automakers
to create the next generation of irresistible in-car gadgets. This
week at the Consumer Electronics Show -- the neon-drenched annual
trade show in Las Vegas -- these companies are demonstrating the
breadth of their ambitions, like 10-inch screens above the gear
shift, showing high-definition videos, 3-D maps and Web pages. By
Ashlee Vance and Matt Richtel.

      FED-ECON (Undated) -- Members of the Federal Reserve continued to
grapple with uncertainties facing the economy at their most recent
meeting, with some members suggesting that the central bank might
have to expand measures to help the mortgage markets if the
recovery stumbles. The minutes of last month's Fed meeting released
on Wednesday revealed divisions among members of the powerful Fed
committee that sets interest rates and makes key decisions about
whether to expand or contract emergency programs deployed to shore
up the economy. By Jack Healy.
