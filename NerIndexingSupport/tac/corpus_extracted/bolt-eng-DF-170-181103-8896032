 
 
"You're Hired!" Rick Perry Slogan
 
 
Will he run for POTUS?

I don't know, but WOW! What a message Rick Perry delivered last night when he told a room full of enthusiastic New York Republicans (and dowager biased, conservative-hating infotainment spinners):
(referring to silly ol' Donald Trump)

"He's known for saying You're Fired!" Perry said. " We're known for saying You're Hired ! That's what we do in Texas!"

Notice how the idiot reporter titled her diatribe to base: "Perry stays mum" and compares him to George W. Bush (to appeal to Bush Derangement Syndrome neophytes)

Oh, bwahahahahaha !!!

Rick Perry sounds like a guy I'd like to see running for President!!

How about it, Governor Perry, enter the race and kick some BHO heiney!

 
 
 
Two words to beat Obama: "You're hired!!!"

It's just that simple!!!
 
 
To all the DNC operatives who are pushing this thread to the bottom this morning? I'm sayin':

BUMP!!
 
 
ok, ok, ok... So this thread didn't make it to the big time. *sigh* oh, well.

I really thought the unemployment rate in the USA was an issue. I thought people would really like jobs and to get off welfare, to take pride in themselves and a great job. To give their families the basics in life, kids, school for the kids, a home in a good neighborhood, a good car...

I guess that's only in my beautiful Texas.

So, ok. We'll just keep telling folks here, "You're hired." And give 'em good jobs with a secure future.

And we'll keep Governor Rick Perry to ourselves, if y'all insist.

No harm. No foul.

 
 
 
You know what the irony here is?

He's talking to New Yorkers.

The unemployment rate in Texas is 8%.

The unemployment rate in New York is 7.9%

The per capita income of Texas (2009) 36,484

Wow, a response from a person in fabulous New York that has the best theater district in the world, a startlingly beautiful and busy harbor, the Statue of Liberty, great food and the best chefs everywhere, and more skyscrapers per square mile than almost anywhere else in the world. Thanks, for responding NYcarbineer. You truly have an amazing state.

And you came up with a nice theoretical surrebuttal, too. There's only one problem. After a couple of years, we don't forget the jobless in the Friendship State. They're still in our stats. I hear that's not the case everywhere there's an easy vote to collect if you ignore all the jobless elephants in the livin' room.

 

Come to Texas, where we have a sayin': You're hired!!!

Well "Where's the beef" worked for Reagan.
Prople are for the most part pretty stupit and elections are merely popularity contests.

 

"Stupit?" Well, that's antithesis to the Republican message where the individual dignity, worth, and value are always valued. And I have a feeling if Rick Perry ever decides that yes, he will run for POTUS and somehow wins, just his winning will tell the financial sector a little message: it's high time to be hirin' again.

Success starts with an idea. Rick Perry fired up that idea by reminding people of his dedication to see that he will roll up his shirtsleeves and get industries in the hiring mood again, and there will be an abundance of jobs. He will do all a man can do to make sure Americans are helping Americans with work.

Only two men in history have overcome the 1-term gubernatorial firing tendency in the Friendship State. That's George W. Bush who bent over backward as President and did all he could do to make sure people had jobs, and Rick Perry who seems determined to outdo President Bush.

Texans hiring a guy for a second term as governor just hasn't been done all that often, but GWB started something, and it's all about making sure people have job opportunities, and the best place for that is in the private sector job area.
 
 
BTW, have you noticed how much Rick Perry SOUNDS like George W. Bush. Seriously, I mean the voice, the accent.

Oh, and let's not forget, in 2000 GW Bush was the rising star from Texas everyone was raving about.

Sorry, dear, you're all washed up. My education after high school was everywhere else except Texas, and I've been around the world a half dozen times. Try your schtick on someone who really cares.

I came home to Texas to retire after 45 years because I was proud of two astonishing fellow Texans--President Bush and Governor Perry and their great Texan staffs.

The idiots are the NYT press wannabes who keep shooting themselves in the foot while aimin' at great Texans on account of not liking southern accents.

If you want presidential persons in your state, brew some folks who care about other human beings' dignity, honesty, and purpose-driven lives.

And quit foisting those little self-centered weiners with gaping negative badmouths all over the place.

Ah, memory lane is such a primrose path, dear, isn't it. May I be so bold as to advise a supplement program that will bring you back into the present?

As I recollect it, minimum wage is 16 times that or better.  

And taking a tea of ginkgo biloba, blueberries, omega-3s, vitamin B complex and vitamin E can help you to keep your brain fitter, you cute little pomegranate, you.
 
 
 
BTW, have you noticed how much Rick Perry SOUNDS like George W. Bush. Seriously, I mean the voice, the accent.

 

This is the one major drawback with Perry as a candidate.

Obama will paint Perry as Bush the third, and that will allow him to run against Bush again.

Thanks for the link to truisms about the low cost of living in Texas, Missourian. Last week, I harvested half a bushel of tomatos from my garden with almost no effort. What a deal, hm?

I've been to every corner of the US, Missourian, and I know of no where else people sound like me, but everyone I ever met outside the state knew I was from Texas. In some places, that's grounds for Texans to just shut up. Can you imagine a low iq ascribed to our natives by hoity toities who care nothing for whether their fellow man has a job or not, but they just "know" they're quicker than someone else on account of a soft drawl? Such is the object of a lot of amusement deep in the heart of Texas where I live. Experience has taught me to let them rail on until their condescension wires ultimately scramble their climb to the top of the opinion heap.

It's too bad all Americans can't be more like those from the Show-me state who like proof, not poof.

Good points, but to be fair, the cost of living is somewhat cheaper in Texas and tax rates are lower. In the end, both states are pretty comparable when it comes to jobs and earnings versus buying power with those earnings.

nice oops, fatso.
 
 
Well his Job-Creation Record is second to none. No other Governor or President can even come close. He has been creating many Jobs in Texas while all other States have been losing Millions of Jobs. Perry's only down-side is that he does have a pretty big Debt problem in Texas. That just doesn't sit well with real Conservatives. I'm sure he will get the Texas Debt problem fixed though. He is a real leader. He's a good candidate over all. He certainly beats anyone the Democrats have to offer. And his "You're Hired!" slogan sure does beat that ridiculous "Hope & Change" slogan too.

I saw him interviewed yesterday and he stated that he frequently heads to CA to steal businesses. He said that he and Rick Scott (gov of FL) often find themselves in healthy competition, with Scott trying to woo back businesses that headed to TX from FL.

I like that spirit.

I thought you were better than this. What a shame that you are so typical.

Thanks, for responding NYcarbineer. You truly have an amazing state.

And you came up with a nice theoretical surrebuttal, too. There's only one problem. After a couple of years, we don't forget the jobless in the Friendship State. They're still in our stats. I hear that's not the case everywhere there's an easy vote to collect if you ignore all the jobless elephants in the livin' room.

 

Come to Texas, where we have a sayin': You're hired!!!

 

The unemployment rate in Texas is calculated exactly the same way, using exactly the same methodology as every other state...

Including New York, and including my state - perhaps the most liberal state in the nation with an unemployment rate of 5.3% and per capita incomes higher than Texas.

Apparently you don't know what a post turtle is.

The concept of the post turtle says as much about the people that voted for Obama as it does Obama. Like you, for example.

 
...The old rancher said, "When you're driving down a country road on you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a 'post turtle".

The old rancher saw the puzzled look on the doctor's face so he continued to explain. "You know he didn't get up there by himself, he doesn't belong up there, and he doesn't know what to do while he's up there, and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put him up there to begin with".

 

Perry wasn't calling for TX to secede. You know this to be true but you are a typical partisan hack who wants to perpetuate falsehoods. That disappoints me.

Yes, let's why Texas is so great for jobs, with its 8% unemployment and low wages,

compared to Vermont,

at 5.3%.

The SOCIALIST state.

Must be all those illegals in Vermont working in the chicken plucking factories lololol.
 
 
The Democrats have no one better than Rick Perry to offer for President. He has consistently created Jobs while all others have lost Millions. His Debt problem in Texas is the real down-side to his candidacy. True Conservatives will have a problem with him on that. But still,what have the Democrats brought us? Massive Unemployment,Massive Spending,Massive Debt,Record Poverty,Skyrocketing Food & Gas Prices,and Five Wars. Yea i think Perry could only be an improvement.
 
 
 
 
 
We're poorer and less educated because you watched the Texas Chain Saw Massacre 999 times?

Oh, my, by all means, check your shock absorbers. Your car may not be in touch with the level of your condescension to speak to little ol' Texas-born me today.

     

 

I'm condescending to anyone who childishly denies the facts when they're face to face with them.

Btw, did you know that the unemployment rate in the entire region of New England is lower than it is in Texas?

Why do you suppose that is, if you're the jobs mecca?

 

Texas cost of living: Texas Cost Of Living Statistics
Apartments -$715 per month - Utilities- $105 per month
Electricity - 9.21 cents KWH - Gas Prices - $2.60 per gallon
State Sales Tax : 6.25% - 8.25% (depending on local taxes)
Gasoline Tax-.20 cents per gallon
Diesel Fuel Tax -.20 cents per gallon
Cigarette Tax - $1.41 per pack of 20
Income Taxes - None

 Texas Cost Of Living 
Now, how does that compare to New England?

 

Since you're on the link with the stats why don't you post it?
 
 
I still don't see the Democrats offering anyone better than Rick Perry. I'll put his Job-Creation Record up against any other Governor/President in this country. And guess what? He'll win every time. Only true Conservatives could have a problem with Rick Perry. His Debt problem in Texas bothers true Conservatives. But Socialist/Progressive Democrats dissing him is just plain laughable. They have absolutely nothing to boast about. They have only given us Massive Debt but without the Jobs. So go with Rick Perry. He trumps them in every aspect.
 
 
Apparently according to this thread we NY'ers should pack up and move to Texas where we can work for 30% less,

but that's worth it, because cigarettes are cheaper there.

I got news for you. New Yorkers are moving. They're leaving in droves. Pretty soon all New York will have left is the selfish greedy Takers. You're beginning to see this in California as well. The Takers will always stay and demand their Freebies. But what happens when your productive Citizens leave? Who pays for all the Government Freebies then? California and New York are rapidly becoming Third World nightmares. They made a grave error in chasing all their productive Citizens out. My prediction is that most if not all Democratic-controlled areas of the country will eventually resemble Detroit. The Socialists/Progressives got it wrong Big-Time.

 Gov. Rick Perry for president gains an endorsement 

It's rather refreshing to read this article about Governor Rick Perry, R-TX:
Many of our House Republicans are impressed with Gov. Perrys record of conservative leadership and job creation, Arkansas State Rep. David J. Sanders, R-Little Rock, said Tuesday. As his neighbors to the northeast, weve taken particular interest in how Gov. Perry has focused on creating economic opportunity for Texans.

The Arkansas lawmakers wrote that Mr. Perry could provide the right kind of leadership for the U.S. during uncertain economic times.

California and New York's Socialist/Progressive Democrats have made a grievous error in chasing their productive Citizens out of State. Who do they think is going to pay for all their Takers who will always be demanding their Government Freebies? Demonizing & punishing successful Businesses was a catastrophic error committed by Socialists/Progressives. The Takers are never leaving. They will always be there demanding their Freebies. But with the Producers leaving in droves,who's gonna pay for all those Freebies now? Just take a close look at Detroit. Because that really is what most if not all Democratic-controlled areas of the country will eventually look like. It's already starting to happen in California and New York. Unfortunately,Third World misery is all Californians & New Yorkers have to look forward to. Things are going to get much worse in these two States.

Thank god Moonbeam is governor again in CA. The last time Brown was governor, CA was an explosion of economic prosperity, education, and innovation, and he left the state with a budget surplus.

However, I am sure that you were more of a Meg Whitman fan.

Yeppers, my search of the net confirms that and better, sometimes, although it's going to be apples and oranges to some:   1 bedroom apt, NY $419,000 v. 5-bedroom dream home in Dallas-Ft. worth area, $170,000 

Two years ago, we went for a phenomenal place within 100 miles of where I graduated from high school. We spent around the same amount you can get the claustrophobic apartment, plus we have a stable, arena, swimming pool, 2 creeks and a huge acreage. It took us a year to find a place large enough to hold our dining room furniture, a studio, an office, and a greenhouse with plenty of land to explore for beloved family kids.

It's been like living in heaven, especially around blackberry time.

Brown is not the answer. He's an old corrupt retread. And yes i do think Whitman would have been a better choice for California. She would have created Jobs. California made another catastrophic blunder choosing Brown. Third World misery is on the way for them. And that goes for New York too. It's actually very sad.

3rd Least Debt-Ridden State: Texas

The Lonestar States debt load may be low, but so are its coffers, and Texas cities and towns are feeling the pinch.

According to the office of Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, [Texas Comptroller Susan] Combs sent Texas cities $342.6 million in sales tax allocations, down 8.3 percent compared to November 2008. So far this calendar year, city sales tax allocations are down 4.2 percent compared to the same time period last year. Texas counties received November sales tax allocations of $28.2 million, down 14.5 percent compared to one year ago. For the calendar year-to-date, county sales tax allocations are running 3.7 percent below 2008 revenues.

Total State Debt: $33,299,313,000

Total Population: 24,326,974

Debt per Resident: $1,368.82

8th Most Debt-Ridden State: New York

Remember: these are 2008 numbers and in the past year many states have seen their debt increase even more, and much of that is driven by deficits. New York is no exception.

As reported by Epoch Times, Gov. David Paterson said that the state's budget deficit has turned out to be $21 billion, twice his original estimate. As a result, the state government will delay paying the debt for schools, counties and local governments.

Gov. Patterson said this is the largest escalation of a state budget deficit in the nations history.

Total State Debt: $114,240,227,000

Total Population: 19,490,297

There's one thing you're forgetting: New York is not Detroit. Detroit is a one-trick pony whereas NY is the Center of the Universe and the single most important place in America and the world. There's more opportunity, more to do here, and a higher standard of living than anywhere else.

People live here because they want to live here hence the high property values. The best always costs more.

Global Warming is very yesterday. It is called "Climate Change".

Get with the program.

I said it was a mini-cap and tax program. The rest of that liberal bill included lots of toxic liberal environazi regulation that drove business right out.

You could pretend it didn't...but for the first time, in 2007, more people were leaving than coming in, and that pattern has continued yearly.

Your sentiments do not mimic historical facts. While Brown may not be the answer, he has a track record of creating jobs and reducing the debt. However, you are a partisan hack and simply cannot acknowledge this fact.
 
 
When considering income tax, NY people making those great salaries of $500,000 pay $35,456.00 plus 8.97% in excesses. The penalty for making $40,000 or more is only $1,946 plus 6.85% for any excess income. What do people do who can't afford the $419,000 for the 1-bedroom apartment?

 http://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/2010/inc/n...te_150_201.pdf 

I guess I didn't really realize it, but Texas charges no income tax at all, letting people keep their earnings instead of picking pockets of workers.

I stand by what i said. Brown is not the answer. Whitman would have been a better choice. Hey i wish Californians and New Yorkers well though. But i think very dark days are still ahead for both. You can't just demonize and punish successful businesses and think you're gonna get away with it. There will be a price to pay for those grievous errors. When the Takers begin to outnumber the Producers,that's when you're big problems begin. Who's gonna pay for all of California and New York's Takers in the future? Their demands for Government Freebies aren't just gonna suddenly stop. It all has to be paid for. The Socialists/Progressives should have thought about that before demonizing and punishing their successful producers. I do wish them the best though.

Perry doubled the debt while being a governor of Texas. He will make a fine candidate for the Republican Party.

 

Oh, good grief, do your own research.

It turns out that transportation is responsible for most of the added debt load [16 billion] under Perry, increasing from basically nothing in 2000 to $11.8 billion outstanding as of Aug. 31 2009.
That's because before 2001, the Texas Department of Transportation lacked the authority to borrow money to pay for road projects. Voters gave it that power in 2001 when they approved a constitutional amendment that Perry supported.

lol...from your own source. Perry is one of four members on the Bond Review Board, which ultimately approves most state debt transactions. And over the years, we found, he was a leading advocate for expanding state debts to pay for transportation projects and to combat cancer.

Perhaps we should try this again when you actually read your own sources.....

Read for comprehension.

I didn't say it wasn't true, I said that $11.8 billion of the $16 billion spent was borrowed for transportation via a voter approved constitutional amendment that was passed just before Perry was elevated to governor.

The option for borrowing for transportation projects was not available before Perry gain the office...that voter approved change accounts for the vast majority of the debt added under Perry.

Let's just debate this in one thread or the other...you choose.

Once a candidate declares a flashlight is turned on, some survive, others fade away to Law&Order reruns and cameo appearances on TV shows.
 
 
 
 
 
But at what cost? To make the dirtiest state in the Nation? Why do Republicans see China as an "economic model"?

Now I'm confronted with people DYING thread in CHINA as Obama seems to tout their success while his policies are killing US?

Deany? YOU need a checkup...from the neckup.

 

Yea, his policies are killing us. Like the EPA and regulating Wall Street. Funny how that works.

 

While YOU omit Obama and the Statists in Congress...

Again? Checkup from the neckup. I emplore you. Seek help immediately.

Apparently according to this thread we NY'ers should pack up and move to Texas where we can work for 30% less,

but that's worth it, because cigarettes are cheaper there.

 

I got news for you. New Yorkers are moving. They're leaving in droves. Pretty soon all New York will have left is the selfish greedy Takers. You're beginning to see this in California as well. The Takers will always stay and demand their Freebies. But what happens when your productive Citizens leave? Who pays for all the Government Freebies then? California and New York are rapidly becoming Third World nightmares. They made a grave error in chasing all their productive Citizens out. My prediction is that most if not all Democratic-controlled areas of the country will eventually resemble Detroit. The Socialists/Progressives got it wrong Big-Time.

 

We let the B=list New Yorkers move South. In the Land of the Inbred, the heterozygous Man is King.

lolololol

When considering income tax, NY people making those great salaries of $500,000 pay $35,456.00 plus 8.97% in excesses. The penalty for making $40,000 or more is only $1,946 plus 6.85% for any excess income. What do people do who can't afford the $419,000 for the 1-bedroom apartment?

 http://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/2010/inc/n...te_150_201.pdf 

I guess I didn't really realize it, but Texas charges no income tax at all, letting people keep their earnings instead of picking pockets of workers.

Except where marked, Texas is NUMBER ONE in all these areas according to the US Census Bureau:

Percentage of Population without Health Insurance

Percentage of home refinance loans that are subprime-mortgage
loans (generally 3 to 4 percentage points or
more higher than a comparable prime market loan

Amount of Toxic Emissions from Manufacturing Facilities

Amount of Toxic Release Inventory Chemicals
Used by Manufacturing Industries

Number of Clean Water Permit Violations

Number of Environmental Civil Rights Complaints

Number of Hazardous Waste and Spills

Amount of Ozone Pollution Exposure (2nd)

Percentage of Uninsured Children

Percentage of Fully-Immunized Two-Year Olds (50th, which is kind of first)

Teenage Birth Rate (2nd)

Number of Job-Discrimination Lawsuit (3rd - what's that doing here?)

Number of Executions

Number of Adults in the Criminal Justice System

Number of Adults Incarcerated (2nd)

Number of Firearm Deaths (2nd)

Number of Registered Machined Guns

Number of Traffic Fatalities

Number of Alcohol-Related Traffic Fatalities

Number of Road-Rage Traffic Fatalities (2nd)

 http://shapleigh.org/system/reportin...documents3.pdf 

And people keep calling Texas a "success"? I think the difference between what liberals think is a success and what the right wing thinks is a success is bigger than the Grand Canyon. Liberals simply don't want to live in a wild west cesspool

 

A Democrat...naturally for you deany...

 Over half of all new jobs created in the last year were created in Texas 

Focus dipshit, and uhmm? DEAL WITH IT.

 

I wish I could understand how such a "dirty" state is a good place to live. 5 of the 15 fattest cities are in Texas with Houston being the "fattest" city in the US. No one has insurance. High dropout rate. The air is dirty, the water is dirty. I guess right wingers like "dirt".

California and New York's Socialist/Progressive Democrats have made a grievous error in chasing their productive Citizens out of State. Who do they think is going to pay for all their Takers who will always be demanding their Government Freebies? Demonizing & punishing successful Businesses was a a catastrophic error committed by Socialists/Progressives. The Takers are never leaving. They will always be there demanding their Freebies. But with the Producers leaving in droves,who's gonna pay for all those Freebies now? Just take a close look at Detroit. Because that really is what most if not all Democratic-controlled areas of the country will eventually look like. It's already starting to happen in California and New York. Unfortunately,Third World misery is all Californians & New Yorkers have to look forward to. Things are going to get much worse in these two States.

 

Thank god Moonbeam is governor again in CA. The last time Brown was governor, CA was an explosion of economic prosperity, education, and innovation, and he left the state with a budget surplus.

However, I am sure that you were more of a Meg Whitman fan.

 

Brown is not the answer. He's an old corrupt retread. And yes i do think Whitman would have been a better choice for California. She would have created Jobs. California made another catastrophic blunder choosing Brown. Third World misery is on the way for them. And that goes for New York too. It's actually very sad.

 

I though John Rocker gave an apt description of New York.

"I'd retire first. It's the most hectic, nerve-racking city. Imagine having to take the 7 Train to the ballpark looking like you're riding through Beirut next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's depressing... The biggest thing I don't like about New York are the foreigners. You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking English. Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and Russians and Spanish people and everything up there. How the hell did they get in this country?[3]"
 
 
 
 
 
I thought you were better than this. What a shame that you are so typical.

 

Better then what?

I guy who photoshops the president's head on a tortoise on a sign post and uses it for his avatar?

Better then that?

In the real world..Perry was saying that Secession is an option for Texas.

Yeah..he really did.

Now he may run for President.

Seems like a conflict of interest.

 

Apparently you don't know what a post turtle is.

The concept of the post turtle says as much about the people that voted for Obama as it does Obama. Like you, for example.

 
...The old rancher said, "When you're driving down a country road on you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a 'post turtle".

The old rancher saw the puzzled look on the doctor's face so he continued to explain. "You know he didn't get up there by himself, he doesn't belong up there, and he doesn't know what to do while he's up there, and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put him up there to begin with".

 

Perry wasn't calling for TX to secede. You know this to be true but you are a typical partisan hack who wants to perpetuate falsehoods. That disappoints me.

 

 

Again..pot calling kettle black...you post crap like that about Obama..and yet you view yourself as what? A middle of the roader? Nope. That's partisan hackery.

And as to Perry..well yeah..he said secession is an option. Well, not legally. So what he is saying is that Insurrection is an option. And I guess he's correct. But it's not in keeping with the Constitution.

Which begs the question.

Why the heck would you want someone like that as president?

It's a remarkably radical, un-american and irresponsible thing to "casually" banter about when you are talking about policy.

You still haven't explained why unemployment is just as bad in Texas as it is in NY.

Or why it's much worse than it is in Vermont, or Massachusetts.

Why are you all dodging those simple facts?
 
 
I'm sure Texans would be very happy to see New Yorkers stay in New York,but that's not what's happening. New Yorkers are leaving in droves. Pretty soon New York and California will resemble Detroit. You can't demonize and punish your successful productive citizens. They will simply leave as a result of such treatment. You're beginning to see this exodus in California and New York. Their Takers will be outnumbering their Producers in the near future. And when that happens you become a Third World nightmare. Who's gonna pay for all those Government Freebies in California and New York? Takers only take and will only keep on taking. They should have treated their productive citizens much better in California and New York. On the other hand,Perry and Texas are doing just fine. Productive citizens and Businesses want to be there.

Since our UE numbers and earnings numbers are better than Texas, why should those of here CARE if New Yorkers leave? What's wrong with that? If New Yorkers who can't make it here want to go to Texas and pluck chickens alongside the illegals, that's their business.

New York is a real shit hole. The place literally stinks. I prefer you New Yorkers stay right where you are. You guys and people in California only have a Detroit-like Third World nightmare to look forward to. In fact i would say most if not all Democrat-controlled areas of the country will eventually resemble Detroit. The Socialists/Progressives just got things wrong Big-Time. Chasing away successful Producers only leaves you with greedy lazy Takers. But who pays for all those Government Freebies now? There will be much darker days for New York and California in the future. Perry and Texas will be just fine.

There are only two explanations for such an ignorant statement:

1. you've never been to New York in your entire natural born life and get your views from radio or...

2. you're just making shit up.

Of course, the two are not mutually exclusive. If you don't like cities, that's fine. To each their own - But NYC is not a stinky shit-hole. It is quite possibly the most vibrant and culturally diverse place on earth, with more opportunities and more access to culture than any place on the planet. Nowhere else on the globe can you experience such a stupendous variety of people, food, arts, sports and activities in such a small place. And it's probably one of the cleanest cities in the world over a million people.

It's also densely populated, which some love and some hate.

Rick Perry is still much better than anyone the Democrats have to offer. What have they done for us? They've only given us the Massive Debt & Spending but without the Jobs. Rick Perry is not my ideal Conservative but at least he does have a great record of creating Jobs. No Democrat in this country including the President,can boast about that. Rick Perry whips all Democrats fairly easily.
 
 
Well, here it is 3 months later, and Perry is ahead of the pack this week in a CNN Poll of September 12. I hope these results tabulate ok:

BASED ON 446 REPUBLICANS -- SAMPLING ERROR: +/- 4.5 PERCENTAGE PTS.
34. Next, I'm going to read a list of people who may be running in the Republican primary for president
in 2012. After I read all the names, please tell me which candidate you would be most likely to
support for the Republican nomination for President in the year 2012, or if you would support
someone else. Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, businessman Herman Cain, former
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, former Alaska
Governor Sarah Palin, Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Texas Governor Rick Perry, former
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, or former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum

(RANDOM ORDER)
Sept. 9-11 Aug. 24-25 Aug. 5-7 July 18-20
2011 2011 2011 2011
Perry 30% 30% 16% 15%
Romney 18% 17% 19% 19%
Palin 15% 12% 16% 15%
Paul 12% 6% 12% 10%
Cain 5% 3% 4% 6%
Gingrich 5% 6% 6% 4%
Bachmann 4% 10% 7% 12%
Huntsman 2% 1% 5% 1%
Santorum 2% 1% 2% 2%
Someone else (vol.) 2% 6% 6% 5%
None/ No one (vol.) 4% 6% 5% 9%
No opinion 2% 2% 2% 2%

I guess some are happy, others aren't. I looked at Rasmussen. His info is private unless you are a member, but he said a "Generic Republican" has a 47 to 44 lead over Obama. So I'm posting CNN's findings.
 
 
I guess there's one thing that makes the CNN poll less accurate than it could be--they factored in Palin, and she is not running for President at all.

That doesn't give the clearest picture, and probably skews the bottom a lot.
 
 
Oh, Bobby Jindahl just endorsed Rick Perry yesterday. that's really nice.  

 He says that Perry's record on job creation just can't be beat .

Yeah, baby!!!! Yea!!!

     
 
 
Some more good news for Governor Rick Perry has come up. The Wall Street Journal has named Texas as being  the best place to do business .

All the lies in all the papers you read saying mean things about Governor Perry as not doing well enough are powder puff little white lies, because they are afraid Governor Perry is just the man to win the election in 2012.

You Go There, Governor Perry!
 
 
 
Will he run for POTUS?

I don't know, but WOW! What a message Rick Perry delivered last night when he told a room full of enthusiastic New York Republicans (and dowager biased, conservative-hating infotainment spinners):
(referring to silly ol' Donald Trump)

"He's known for saying You're Fired!" Perry said. " We're known for saying You're Hired ! That's what we do in Texas!"

Read more:  Rick Perry stays mum - Maggie Haberman - POLITICO.com 
Notice how the idiot reporter titled her diatribe to base: "Perry stays mum" and compares him to George W. Bush (to appeal to Bush Derangement Syndrome neophytes)

Oh, bwahahahahaha !!!

Rick Perry sounds like a guy I'd like to see running for President!!

How about it, Governor Perry, enter the race and kick some BHO heiney!

 

 

I've got a couple more:

MINIMUM WAGE!

UNINSURED!

PROSPERITY
THROUGH
LOWER
WAGES!
 
 
There's a reason the Wall Street Journal issued Texas that honor, too. While Rick Perry has been in office, one million new jobs have been created in Texas.

When you combine the total of all the other 49 states, 2.5 million jobs have been lost.

Perry leads in the polls, but the obfuscating leftist polls are hiding his numbers by incorporating people who are not even running for president into the polls, skewing the numbers that Perry really has by probably 15 or 20 points. Others are inserting feel-good questions that truly have nothing to do with who the person they are polling plans to vote for based on their true feelings.

 Zogby  does give some raw data, and it is (I omitted the 5 or 6 bottom runners to avoid embarrassing anyone) as follows:

And I've got one: PERRY, = plus one million jobs
The other 49 Governors together, = minus two million, five hundred thousand jobs

Also, the minimum wage hype is untrue, the uninsured hype is not so, the lower wages is a myth.

The Wall Street Journal rated Rick Perry's Texas the leader in the nation based on job creation and overall prosperity, rdean.

I'm so sorry your little DNC stats are skewed, but you know how some of those politicians don't belly up to the table and put the truth on top.

Governor Perry has earnestly pursed and obtained new jobs for the past several years, and it's brought the bacon home to Texas.

And do answer me one thing, rdean. If Texas is as bad as you're saying, why in the world are a thousand people a day on the average, pouring into Texas for work?
 
 
I'm not sure what the Florida poll was all about, but I'm not buying the Cain victory, although it earned him a lot of respect from people who hadn't taken him seriously before. I don't know what the state tolerates in its politicking, whether a boatload of Democrats were up to their typical ACORN election hijinks of screwing with Republicans, but that being said, I'd like us to take a close look at who supports whom.

In the Republican party which picks its own candidate, Perry is ahead if you isolate Perry and Romney from the pack. As of September 28, 2011 (today's date), that would be

Perry 42%
Romney 38%

The part the Democrat press wants people to hear, they're isolating Iowa, the state most hurting from unemployment and calling it Romney 24% and Perry 20%. Cain is way down there in the 7% bracket, which reflects a rise due to the wild ride in Florida that put him far higher than he's ever been.

I chalk it up to press dootsies, and I'm here to tell you unemployment is the centering Elephant-in-the-Living-Room issue the press doesn't want anyone to mark, least of all a broken-record speaker like me who is enchanted by Governor and Mrs Perry over some things he said 3 or 4 years ago that played a part in my family's decision to come back home to Texas for retirement.

Sage or silly? I don't know, except I know Rick Perry's record on jobs.

His average is 50% of all new jobs in the nation for State Governors, and the other 49 states have 50%, which divides out to an average of 1% more or less per state other than Rick Perry's Texas.

I'm hoping people with jobs feel for and know what it's like to be jobless as 10%+ of Americans are right now who don't want to be jobless. They want jobs.

Perry's the man. He and his Texas team have gone out there, solicited and sung for jobs for this state's economy, and seems to me he's most likely to be the person who could help restore America's place in the free world, just by making sure every American within these confines of our nation and who wants a job has access to the job market, gets, and holds a job.

It won't happen unless we give the most gifted job-giver the job of President.

Support Rick Perry for President. Yeah, he had a back surgery and was a little down in the mouth there for awhile, but he's gaining strength back every day and launched his campaign at this difficult time in his life.

I'm asking you to trust his American can-do life of drumming up jobs and applying it to the national and international enterprise areas. His voice is in actions, and he will put jobs in America, and he will get cooperation from everyone in the private sector who can and wants our America to go forward in the world.

Just a little reminder the future is on each of us. We either give it to the guy who will earn a new base by promoting job development successfully or we can settle for more tap dancing and bashing oil and gas development in the Gulf along with the high prices on gasoline that has our nation sluggish to put it mildly. We can put it in Rick Perry's hands and employ Americans, or we can dootsie around like the press does, trying to eliminate any semblance of Republicans the way Wiked-pedia has for those of us who've tried to find ANYTHING we did to get here. Wikipedia was not crediting Republicans for being the Anti-Slavery party it started out as in favor of doing a series of double-to-the rear marches omitting that part of Republican history, and going for recent ridicules straight out of the Democrat spin room as rightful heirs to Republican hard work, which is batstuff crazy in its best light, and downright deception in the clear and unobstructed light of day.

Vote Rick Perry, please. He will bring home the bacon in jobs. Thanks.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

Pretty good, Americano. Yep, Solyndra among other things didn't go the way Obama planned, and the present dismal situation seems shovel ready. I just hope that Perry's true voice, which is putting Americans back to work in a good and fair way is well-received by Americans who want their fellow Americans to get back to work. Unfortunately, we have to wait until 2012 and a strong win in at least the 49 states that aren't happy with the unemployment situation. Obama can have Illinois, his home state. Wouldn't want to wish ill on anyone. But I do hope IL wakes up and joins the rest of us. It's home to my conservative husband's family, and I love them. *sigh*
 
 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Texas. governor, Rick Perry raised more than $17 million in his first seven weeks running for president, his campaign announced Wednesday, an impressive total that helps cement his status as the top alternative to Mitt Romney and counter the perception that his campaign his struggling. Perry immediately rose to the top of national polls after he announced his run, but his debate performances have been shaky and he’s dropped back in recent surveys. His money haul shows his struggles aren’t yet affecting his fundraising. Perry's reports will show that almost half of his money comes from donors who live in Texas.

 Washington Times 

All that malarkey, and Perry still is bringing in the hard cash, and almost half of that is from his home state of Texas.  
 
 
I recently received Dr. Clouthier's letter and would like to share an exerpt from her words:

"Why I support Rick Perry"

 
Rick Perry will be the next POTUS if I have anything to do with it. I'm a mom, a doctor, a business owner, a former Michigander, Californian, New Yorker, conservative with a libertarian streak, a Tea Party attender and reporter, blogger, and for 14 years, a Texan.

I live under the light hand of the Texas system--a hand that Governor Perry has done everything in his power to make lighter. He cut the size and scope of government even as the Texas population grew faster than any place in the nation. We started a business here with nothing but a credit card and were making two thousand a month with a baby. Slowly, surely, we built our business and life. When we first got to Texas, my husband worked with doctors who were heavily involved in the Worker's Comp (work injuries) and Personal Injury (car accidents) system. It was rife with abuse. There were rings of lawyers, doctors, and accident fakers who exploited the system. Governor Perry directly took on the fraud and abuse which meant taking on the trial lawyers association. In one day after the law was passed (my husband had long since gone into practice for himself and had a holistic practice), the shysters lost the whole scam. It was beautiful to behold.

This past year, Governor Perry pushed through "loser pays" on lawsuits. I cannot even tell you how much lawyers in Texas hate Rick Perry, and it's one reason I love his record. It's also a reason, they'll fight tooth and nail against him nationally."...

 

Dr. Clouthier's letter goes on, about Perry's curbing malpractice judgments and fighting multiple issues with Obama's EPA, Obamacare, the border, and all the other socialist agendas of President Obama, and how Rick Perry has tangled with the administration not just rhetorically, but also in the courts of law.

Rick Perry is still the top Republican fund-raiser, he has a lot of Texans in favor of him for the above and many other reasons (49% of his funds come from happy Texans).

Governor Perry is truly a conservative who has seen the light and will faithfully render fiscal measures that have a heart toward those who truly need care, and a stop, think twice deal for those scamming the system.

Perry will clean this nation up, cut the deficit, and revise all that is bad about passing a 2500-page Obamacare pk rife with scammer loopholes and non-healthcare measures.

You go, Governor Perry!
 
 
 
Will he run for POTUS?

I don't know, but WOW! What a message Rick Perry delivered last night when he told a room full of enthusiastic New York Republicans (and dowager biased, conservative-hating infotainment spinners):
(referring to silly ol' Donald Trump)

"He's known for saying You're Fired!" Perry said. " We're known for saying You're Hired ! That's what we do in Texas!"

Notice how the idiot reporter titled her diatribe to base: "Perry stays mum" and compares him to George W. Bush (to appeal to Bush Derangement Syndrome neophytes)

Oh, bwahahahahaha !!!

Rick Perry sounds like a guy I'd like to see running for President!!

How about it, Governor Perry, enter the race and kick some BHO heiney!

 

 

Some of us are well aware of what " they " do in Texas, and are yet to be impressed.

Thanks for dropping by, Disenchanted 61.    

What can I say, but, "they" (Rick Perry's gubernatorial staff) took his employment directives seriously and worked shoulder to shoulder with Governor Perry to make Texas a place where people could come to find a job, and they found them here. Our million jobs addition is 49% of the national average, with the other governors (all 49 state governors) claiming the 51%, an average of roughly 1% apiece.

The impressed people are moving into Texas at a rate of 1,000 per day, hoping to find work. Governor Perry and his staff are still gunning for more jobs here to accommodate all Texans, new and future.  

Go, Governor Perry!!!
