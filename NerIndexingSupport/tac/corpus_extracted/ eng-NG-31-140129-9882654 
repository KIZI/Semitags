I know you guys are smarting a bit over the Broncs recent outings...but it's
hard to be too sympathetic since the S&B are STILL trying to overcome our
ongoing malaise... anyway, to change the subject:

Damn!  Those Nuggets are looking solid tonight!   I have a feeling they are
gonna be a force in the West this season.   Thoughts?
