By JIM ACOSTA, CNN

 
(July 30) - President Barack Obama often talks about all of the forces lining up against his health care plan. But there's one critic who has remained relatively mum in the debate. David Scheiner, a Chicago-based doctor, has taken a hard look at the president's prescription for health care reform and sees bad medicine.
"This isn't that kind of health care program that I think is going to work," he said.

So what makes Scheiner so special? He was Obama's personal physician for 22 years, and voted for the then Illinois senator in the 2008 presidential election.
Scheiner thinks the president's plan doesn't go far enough.
"If I had to say the single one thing which is the worst part of it, is that private insurers continue to be a part of the health scheme," he said. "Everybody keeps saying we don't want the government getting involved in health care. [But] the government is involved in Medicare, and it works."

 

 Obama's Former Doctor Against Health Care Plan 

Obviously, this is just one doctor, but there are many others. I just wonder why a doctor would be in favor of a single payer system. Wouldn't that be terrible for doctors?

I sure hope Obama listens to him.
 
 
 
I sure hope Obama listens to him.

 

I do too.

It's the surest way to torpedo his idiotic agenda.
 
 
The guy is another fringe lunatic from Chicago.Of course that's what Obama wants. But his utopian vision of marshmallow fields and Kumbaya diplomacy isn't working the way it was presented in the socialist handbook. Reality bites sometimes,
 
 
I'm tellin' ya!!

Keep running your flap and trotting out these radical authoritarian kooks for all the world to see, Bammy!

72% of the American Public and 56% of the MDs in the US would like to see us adapt a single payer system. In fact, if we had a national referendum on the issue, we would have such a system right away. It is the 1.4 million dollars a day spent by the special interests that are preventing us from getting anything.
 
 
Yeah, right.

Methinks the reactions at the town halls the congressweasels hold during their recess are going to tell a vastly different story.
 
 
Yep. That's why they wanted ti rush it Now that they will have to go home and answer questions (which most will not be answered) public opinion just might sway them Esp if they are up for re-election.

This clunker clunker might be a big waker upper for some on the fence as well.
 
 
Obama listen to Doctors?

The guy who thinks that doctors perform tonsillectomies just to pump up their revenue?

Yeah right
