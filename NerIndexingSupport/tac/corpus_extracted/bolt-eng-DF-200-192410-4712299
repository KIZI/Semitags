 
 
Victoria Beckham looked like a physically challanged unicorn with a filofax today.
 
 
 

Am I rite?
 
 
She's up the duff, allow it
 
 
My feet hurt just looking at her's.  
 
 
I'm intrigued as to how she stuck the hat directly onto her forehead, there seems to be no string.
 
 
look at her left foot  
 
 
How is that hat staying on?

Becks is looking strapping though! (no homo)
 
 
I hate how she is soo controlled. It won't kill her to give her stiff spine a break.
 
 
hehehe.  
 
 
Her shoes look like instruments of torture to me.Her dress isnt anything special, actually it looks like she just put it over her head and that was that.The hat, well I did quite like that......but I have no idea how it stays on.Personally I wouldnt have invited her and David to my wedding.
 
 
They were invited, but two ex prime minister weren't?  
 
 
She stole that hat from a British Airways Air Hostess, surely?!

And why would a woman wear shoes like that? Especially considering she's got a bun in the oven. Madness

Forehead Adhesive.

It's a science.
 
 
She kept trying to hide herself. She really does hate being bigger than a stick.

I saw a lot of hats like that today. They look like they're super glued to their foreheads...
 
 
And is her dress styled on a graduation gown?
 
 
From that photo you would not have guessed that david used to be a footballer!
 
 
Preggers in those heels..!?
Ouch!
 
 
LMAO

so they even let mythical creatures go?
 
 
stop obsessing over celebrities you sheeple.
 
 
Would it kill her to crack a smile?!
 
 
 
LMAO

so they even let mythical creatures go?

 

Neeeggghhh, just Victoria Beckham.
 
 
How the hell does that thing stay on her head.

Her foot looks like it's about to break in half as well.
 
 
 
From that photo you would not have guessed that david used to be a footballer!

 

He still is a footballer.  
 
 
Yeah but look at Becks. (No homo)
 
 
Is she actually pregnant? Let's all marvel at a pregnant woman in heels that size.
 
 
 
He still is a footballer.  

 

Meh. His glory days are over. He should be really thinking about doing something which isn't playing football. I would suggest running some sort of charity, possibly sports based. He's a popular figure - if he were to highlight a good cause then people would probably be pretty sympathetic towards it.
 
 
I bet Richard Keys would still love to 'smash' it.
 
 
 
stop obsessing over celebrities you sheeple.

 

Omg, so funny   !
 
 
Don't be so nasty all of you!
Grow UP!!
 
 
Her shoes.  
 
 
 
Her dress just looks like a giant poncho...and she looks like she's dressed for a funeral :/
 
 
ew.
 
 
 
Don't be so nasty all of you!
Grow UP!!

 

Hi, are you new to the internet?
 
 
Her 'hat' isn't a hat, it is actually a 'fascinator' and it stays on because it's attached to a headband (or is it called a hairband?), you can see it in bigger pictures. I know that because I watched the coverage too much today. And yeah those shoes look horribly painful, her feet are like twisted so it looks like they're about to pop out!
 
 
Who gives a flying **** OP, you pathetic little dweeb
 
 
wow @ her left foot. o.O
 
 
 
I'm intrigued as to how she stuck the hat directly onto her forehead, there seems to be no string.

 

clip you senile bigot  

it's not a mystery.

Either that or some royal glue
 
 
Oh dear... all the black girls are gonna be hopping on the bus with a new breed of fashion

as if Rihanna's red her wasn't enough
 
 
Apparently there is a clip inside that attaches to her hair  

I don't like it, or her dress though  
 
 
i dont think she is able to wear any other shoes, as her feet are probably like statues, from wearing heels all the time lmfao
feel sorry for her feet lmfao  
 
 
I think they both look amazing!

I love her heels. They've got platforms (I think), though the platforms themselves aren't very thick to she is still standing on pretty high heels. Also, she's wearing her own design (dress). I would think the hat has been pinned into place, as have many of the hats worn today?

I am shocked by Samantha Cameron's lack of hat though. Definitely got some media attention that..
 
 
loool maybe she had a spot on her forehead that needed covering?
hey how did she walk in those heels when she's like past 7 months pregnant
 
 
 
 

Am I rite?

 

No one's right - it's personal opinion.

I wasn't too fond of her hat thing but I really liked her dress and I thought she looked very elegant, yet stylish, whereas normally I'm not a fan of her style.
 
 
Plain stupid to wear those shoes when your pregnant. EVEN if your only in the first trimester (she's in the second, right?)
 
 
Yes, I agree.

What is with the hat? Can't she wear it a little farther forward?!?!

That baby is going to pop out wearing high heels the rate she's going.

Mmm, David looks good in a suit though  
 
 
I thought she looked alright until you said that, you've ruined it for me!  

But as for Mr. Goldenballs.... well hello there.
 
 
 
From that photo you would not have guessed that david used to be a footballer!

 

He still is!

What a strange woman Victoria is, when they showed he during the wedding her facial expressions are very peculiar. Also what is she doing wearing shoes like that when she is expecting another baby? Idiot.

Seconded! I loved how she wore her own design too. She's also drifted from the skinny silhoettes that she was renound for with her last collection, which is where the dress is from.. I like it, it's simple and modest, but boasts a lot of confidence (being so simple and modest! =P). The colour may be dark, but it suits her. She definitely did something right if she's being spoken about as well as the new bride!
 
 
Those shoes look so incredibly painful  
 
 
Her hat looks like it's been photoshopped in...
 
 
The first shot I saw of the wedding was her and David, and she literally did not stop posing for a second. It was like 'Ooh there's someone, smile and allow mouth to open very slightly for small talk' and then back to pouting/looking seriously constipated.
 
 
I actually thought she looked alright. Demure.

As for the hat I would imagine she has a load of pins holding it in place.

Agreed. I'm thinking I might go hunting for a dress similar to that actually.

I'm sure there are copies of the dress already out there! =P

I'm sure there are. Although, actually, I take back my previous comment. I wouldn't go for something similar because so many other people will - I'll just try to find something equally beautiful!
 
 
she has a beautiful face though
 
 
I still would.
 
 
I thought hats go on the top of your head, not on your forehead  
 
 
 
Oh dear... all the black girls are gonna be hopping on the bus with a new breed of fashion

as if Rihanna's red her wasn't enough

 

What new breed of fashion?
 
 
She looked incredibly aloof when someone tried to speak to her. Who the hell does she think she is? At least William has a lot of modesty about him.
 
 
I think she looked really pretty. Haters gonna hate
 
 
 
They were invited, but two ex prime minister weren't?  

 

I wasnt annoyed at them being invited, but the fact they invited people from corrupt countries shows that was a clear sign of the royal's hostility towards Labour this year.

Oh yeah, I forgot about them aswell. I mean what the hell royal family!

David Beckham's got an OBE (for what exactly, I can't possibly imagine) which he wore on the wrong lapel.

Doik.

Also, Cherie Blair refused to curtsy for the Queen. I wouldn't invite that rude bitch either.
 
 
I want those shoes.

And cut her some slack people, shes pregnant!
 
 
She looked as though she was attending a funeral, why the dull colours?? On the other hand the Queen looked great in yellow  
 
 
Ouch!  
 
 
 
 

Am I rite?

 

I thought she looked fantastic.
 
 
she is mocking kate's mum looking like a retro airhostess.
 
 
It's like a blue pork pie with a snake stapled to it.
 
 
...I wasn't aware it was the Royal Funeral.
 
 
Anyone else think that her hat just looks like a giant blue chode?
 
 
Victoria Beckham looked so uncomfortable. Looked like she was crapping herself from start to finish. Perhaps not comfortable at such an occasion. Coming from a lower socioeconomic background etc...

just speculatin' innit.

Becks continues to set the trends. Awesome hair style, bro.
 
 
Her foot is bent at an odd angle.
 
 
If you think her hat was bad...

   

 

Although I agree about Victoria Beckham's heels, ****.
 
 
I think she looked nice  
 
 
Wow, hope she gets a girl this time. I find it amazing that she's pregnant and wearing those super-high Christian Louboutin beastly heels! David Beckham looks pretty dashing I must say.

when those ex-PMs in question are bliar and cyclops.....I'd prefer the Beckhams thank you very much  
 
 
 
 

Am I rite?

 

ROFL I've just realised his OBE is on the wrong side.

he did it on purpose
trying to make some sort of statement...
 
 
Okay, so did anyone see David Cameron's tie?!! It was as if he did it in the dark!
 
 
 
If you think her hat was bad...

   

 

Although I agree about Victoria Beckham's heels, ****.

 

Absolutely cant stand that hat. It shows she's trying too hard. We all know they're all wearing designer, and some of the younger ones are trying to make a statement. But this is
