Sudan arrests teacher over 'Mohammed' bear
Briton allowed her class of 7-year-olds to choose teddy bear's name

updated 5:15 a.m. PT, Mon., Nov. 26, 2007

KHARTOUM, Sudan - A British primary school teacher has been arrested in Sudan, accused of insulting Islam's Prophet by letting her class of 7-year-olds name a teddy bear Muhammad, her school said on Monday.

Colleagues of Gillian Gibbons told Reuters they feared for her safety after receiving reports that young men had already started gathering outside the Khartoum police station where the Liverpool woman was being held.

Teachers at Unity High School in central Khartoum said Gibbons, 54, made an innocent mistake and simply let her pupils choose their favorite name for the toy as part of a school project.

Police arrested Gibbons on Sunday at her home inside the school premises, said Unity director Robert Boulos, after a number of parents made a complaint to Sudan's Ministry of Education.

Boulos said she had since been charged with "blasphemy," an offense he said was punishable with up to three months in prison and a fine.

A spokesman from the British Embassy in Khartoum said it was still unclear whether Gibbons had been formerly charged. "We are following it up with the authorities and trying to meet her in person," he said.

Boulos said he had decided to close down the school until January for fear of reprisals in Sudan's predominantly Muslim capital. "This is a very sensitive issue."

"We are very worried about her safety," he added. "This was a completely innocent mistake. Miss Gibbons would have never wanted to insult Islam."

Class voted on toy name
Boulos said Gibbons was following a British National Curriculum course designed to teach young pupils about animals and their habitats. This year's animal was the bear.

Gibbons, who joined Unity in August, asked a girl to bring in her teddy bear to help the second grade class focus, said Boulos.

The teacher then asked the class to name the toy. "They came up with eight names including Abdullah, Hassan and Mohammed. Then she explained what it meant to vote and asked them to choose the name." Twenty out of the 23 children chose Muhammad.

Each child was allowed to take the bear home at weekends and asked to write a diary about what they did with the toy. Each entry was collected in a book with a picture of the bear on the cover, next to the message "My name is Muhammad," said Boulos.

The bear itself was not marked or labeled with the name in any way, he added, saying Sudanese police had now seized the book and had asked to interview the 7-year-old girl.

Boulos said the first he knew about the course was last week when he got a phone call from the Ministry of Education, saying a number of Muslim parents had made formal complaints.

One Muslim teacher at Unity, who also has a child in Gibbons' class, said she had not found the project offensive.

"I had no problem with it at all," the teacher said. "I know Gillian and she would never have meant it as an insult. I was just impressed that she got them to vote."

The country's state-controlled Sudanese Media Centre reported late Sunday that Gibbons had been arrested for "insulting the Prophet Muhammad." It said charges were being prepared "under article 125 of the criminal law" which covers insults against faith and religion.

No one was immediately available for comment from Sudan's ministries of Education or Justice.

Unity, an independent school founded in 1902, is governed by a board representing major Christian denominations in Sudan, but teaches both Christians and Muslims aged 4 to 18.
 

Let me get this straight, it's ok to name people Mohammed but not a teddy bear?

What if the teacher refused to allow the kids to name the teddy bear? I bet a bunch of them would scream "you insulted our religion by not allowing us to name the bear Mohammad."

I think muslims, yes, this time, all of them, are too petty. They can't deal with an organization called Red Cross so they have to have a Red Crescent. They can't deal with kids naming a beloved teddy bear Mohammad but it's perfectly OK to name a bunch of potential terrorists Mohammad.
 
 
     
 
 
What I find funny, is I have a Jesus action figure on my desk right now. He even has a karate chop action...

And guesss what, not one person has been offended by it. Go figure.
 
 
gunnut,

 
I think muslims, yes, this time, all of them, are too petty.
 

but why would this article lead you to believe that?

this came from a country in which sharia law is in place, and had for one of their national figures the mahdi (which the british defeated back in the late 1880s, and so probably didn't make the brit teacher's life any easier)- are you really all that surprised that this happened?
 
 
 
I think muslims, yes, this time, all of them, are too petty.

 

Then I hope no Muslims happen to walk through my library, I've got my copy of the Koran sitting next to "Mein Kampf"!!

I take it the class is made up of Muslim kids who obviously didn't know it was wrong either, as they where the ones who named the bear and not the teacher

Exactly what I was going to say - the Children done it, if it's such an insult, why shouldn't they be the ones taking the rap   ?

Oh yes, I forgot, Sudanese Logic, they had a ready scapegoat, blame anyone but the good Muslim Children (though of course what they were doing was hardly wrong either)  .
 
 
When one knows that the Moslems are oversensitive about their religion and their Prophet, why 'allow' anyone to name a cuddly and loveable Teddy Bear to be named as Mohammed?

Men can always have the name with "Mohammed" but not a Teddy Bear.

And anyway, what is meant by 'allow'?

unfortunate commentary.

btw,the question is,

is it OK to evaluate Muslims/Easterns according to your/Western standarts of judgement?  
 
 
SNC,

If you had, as a child, a teddy bear that you love, what name could you have for it?

If you use any name that is of a person, he could take offence that an inanimate object has been named after him.

There are scoundrels who are named after the Prophet. It too is distasteful. Therefore, why are men allowed to have the name of the Prophet and still do evil things?
 
 
ray jhan,

in my culture,calling "bear" to a person is not welcomed.
when I was in high school.a girl,who fell in love with me platonically, named her teddy afer my name.Because I did not accept her.this was her revenge.  

you are missing a point.lets go on with your example.
Is any man/woman who name after his/her child Muhammad (PBUH) aware of what type of a personality their child will have?NO
even,it is obvious that, parents who name after their children Muhammad are most probably religious people,and do not want their children to become a hobo.that is why they use the name Muhammad for their children.

I do not know whether have you ever taken care before or not,but we respect our Prophet so much, hence, we use the acronym "PBUH" after His name.

in addition,I,as a muslim, do not understand why foreigners are having difficulties understanding our sensitivenesses for some isues (for instance our Prophet) and evaluate our traditions and make inferences with respect to their standarts of judgements.am I wrong?

naming after children Muhammad brings a responsibility in our society.Cuz we respect Him a lot.those who are named after Muhammad should be more sensitive.cuz their name recall the Prophet (PBUH).this is what I infered from my society.but in practice,things are not always like we desired.this is the truth.

Hey, they'll probably whip the kids too - I'm sure there's a codicile somewhere in Sharia Law that calls for that.

Looks like you do it all the time.

Besides, I do think ALL muslims are petty. Not all of them are evil. That's just not possible. But muslims need to learn to be a bit more accomodating to international standards.

No other culture has a problem with the cross in Red Cross. No other group of people riot when they hear rumors of their religious book being mistreated half a world away. No other group of people, while being guests at another country, riot when the citizens of the host country exercises their right of free speech. No other group of people demand special treatment at the level of muslims in the west do.

Muslim families demand to ban pork in UK and US schools. Muslim children get special "prayer" hours during class time. US universities offers "foot washing basin" to accomodate muslim students. Imams praying right before boarding an airliner and asks for seatbelt extention (which can be used as weapons). Then sues airline for kicking them off as a security risk.

Grow up!
 
 
Regarding riots, many many americans get up in arms when a muslim burns the US flag. Why? Because it embodies their beliefs.

The Red Cross. I hardly blame any people that have been invaded and oppressed by Christians for 1400 years to be reactionary against the symbol of the cross.

Do you ever wonder why there are no white men named Jesus? Something offensive about that name or something? Every apostle has men named after him, why not Jesus? I think it was a taboo, in much (or exactly) the same way jews had taboos against near any expression of the name of God. Jews even stoned people for uttering these words, from what I understand. I submit that there was at one time a huge superstitious taboo against it, and this is why we have no tradition of this.

So perhaps we are more sophisticated now than Muslim society. This was not always the case. Christians once refused to bathe when Muslims knew this was a healthy thing. With our sophistication comes decadence, and we expect other cultures to suddenly throw off all the traditions that bind it together in order to be just like us? Please...

I personally think they ought to just kick her out of the country, but the woman has to be stupid to not have asked anyone after the outrage from pious Muslims that we have seen from this sort of thing. Or perhaps she just doesn't pay attention.

As an aside, the arrest might very well have been aggravated because of the voting thing. I'm not sure this government respects democratic values being instilled in its small children.

 Britain: Sikhs Riot, Protest Play, Theater Closes 

 

Hey, I myself am a Sikh and I think that those riots were totally wrong. Protests alone could have done enough. I am all for freedom of speech but the play was questionable. Now i'm not saying that Sikhism should not be criticized at all, but the play was about a Sikh priest raping a woman inside a Sikh temple (Gurudwara). Now, if this was based on a real event, then i'm all for it! Such issues should be brough out and the culprits punished! But when it is based on pure fiction and that too is presented to a foriegn audience which already has little or no knowledge of the Sikh religion, then it is doing nothing more then defaming the religion. However, those Sikhs which rioted didn't do anything better to represent the religion anyways.

I don't. They can burn our flags in their country. That is their right. Where's our right to burn their koran in our country? Not that I would. But if we have to, what do you think will happen?

 
The Red Cross. I hardly blame any people that have been invaded and oppressed by Christians for 1400 years to be reactionary against the symbol of the cross.

 

Oppressed for 1400 years? I don't think you know history.

Obviously you don't live in Los Angeles. Jesus is a very common name among Hispanics. And they are catholics.

Express your discontent without rioting or killing people. That's all I ask.

That's a good point I haven't thought of.

The point is not about changing fundoo Islamic beliefs. No one expects the fundoos to throw off their traditions! They can follow as much tradition as they can, but their traditions shouldn't get in others way! Did you know thousands are killed, harassed and oppressed in Islamic nations simply because they are not muslims? Even in mixed societies like India, they demand special rights, like a special law for Muslims alone? And if you ever come to India, do check out Delhi airport; they have actually made a special terminal for Muslims during Haj! Oh and did you know that the Indian government also pays a good deal of the airfare for Indian muslims to go for Haj to Saudi Arabia each year? You know where that money is coming from? Thats right, our tax money! And i'm not even starting on the new reservation policies for colleges and universities being brought in by the Indian government to appease the muslims. So that is why it gets annoying when a certain group gets all the special privelages and they are STILL complaining about this and that!  

btw, this only happens to be certain radical groups of Muslims. I also think India is a fine example for producing some of the most secular, and progressive Muslims in the world. They just need to expand more rapidly then the fundoos (who are mostly coming from the poorer end of the spectrum)
 
 
 
Oppressed for 1400 years? I don't think you know history.

Obviously you don't live in Los Angeles. Jesus is a very common name among Hispanics. And they are catholics.

 

Yes, should have looked up the date of the first crusades instead of Mohamed's birthdate  

Yes, I know Hispanics do. I huess they are more sophistacated than we are   I did say white men, heheh. Really tho, mainly off-topic as it is, I do wonder why we haven't a tradition of naming sons Jesus!

Tronic

It wasn't so long ago that people were slaughtered in western nations for heresy. As for India, if you object to the government's treatment of Muslims, get them to change the laws. India is a democracy and if the Muslims care more than you do about what they get or dont get, then you get what you have described, yes? The Indian government's treatment of Muslim citizens is no argument against Muslims generally.

I do get your point I think. Correct me if I am wrong. The Muslim population obtained these concessions via riots and violent acts? I agree that is a bad thing. USA has a history of protests turning into riots as well, but here the rioters LOSE.

[I hope that didnt sound offensive; wasnt meant to be. Hard to tell sometimes, but the fact I'm wondering makes me think it might be. If so, my apologies.]

You did not get the point. And no, the Muslims did not achieve all that by riots. My point was that when a country gives so much to you, then why do you still have to bomb that same country in return? Why do those radical muslims still complain? They get all the freedom of speech they desire in India and much much more, yet they are still complaining all the time. They want all the freedom of speech in the world but when the turn of others come, they are completely intolerant and want to shut the other's voice. Just take the example of Taslima Nasreen, a Muslim author who was kicked out of Bangladesh because of her opinions on her own religion! She fled to India. It didn't take long for the Muslims to start rioting here to try to get her kicked out of India also. That is simply pathetic. These fundoos want everything their way! Maybe they have forgotten that they actually live in a secular country rather then an Islamic one due to all the freedom of speech they enjoy here.  
 
 
I want to add something that just occurred to me. If we date Christianity 2000 years, and Islam 1400 years, this is 600 years difference. So Islam is 600 years younger.

Religious persecutions by orthodox christian sects against weaker sects was going strong in 1400 and continues in lessening amounts all the way to today! There are any number of instances including Wycliffe and Luther, the Hugeunots, the Puritans, Catholics by Anglicans and vice versa, witch trials, abortion clinic bombings, church burnings, the KKK, the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo-Nazis, National Socialists....

Do we condemn all christians or even think this behavior is mainstream? No. Do Muslims in Iran think it is? Hmmm, no idea, but some of them likely do.

Anyhow......
 
 
 
I do wonder why we haven't a tradition of naming sons Jesus!

 

For me personally, I'm not a christian so it doesn't make sense to have a name like Jesus.

On the other hand, we do have plenty of people named after the 12 deciples, prominant figures in the bible, and saints. We name things after them too.
 
 
Oh we do and big time, check how many Latin Americans are named Yasus.

However, Gunnut, snc's point is Sudan represents Islam as much as South Korean Minister Sun Myung Moon represents Christianity.
 
 
The actions of Muslims get linked to Islam much more than the actions of others get associated with their religion. And it is entirely the fault of Muslims as they bring Islam into everything. No one links Nazism with Christianity as it was not done in the name of Christianity. But Muslims bring religion into all mundane aspects of life opening their religion to ridicule much more than others.

Then of course is the hyper sensitiveness reflecting insecurity about their religion which is difficult for other to understand as they have never been sensitive to the other's religious feelings. Every last one of them is convinced that the Bible is corrupted, that the Muslim occupation of other people's lands was justified.

They are proud of people destroying the religious places of others praising them as heroes of Islam. The concept of kaafir and Jajiya and dhimmi do not exactly point to Islamic tolerance right since the origins of Islam. So why this expectation of sensitivity from others? Why not question yourself first and start change internally?
 
 
The point is who do we see speaking for them? Their big mouths.

Whom they see speaking for us? Our big mouths.

Granted. But it's not an isolated incident. Some cartoonist makes fun of the religion and riots break out in 2 or 3 nations. Death threats are issued. Cartoonists go into hiding. Salman Rushdie was in hiding for how long? He comes out to accept an award and some people protest. I bet death threats were issued, again.

Why can't the moderate muslims do something about these barbarians tarnishing their religion and their good name?

We punish our barbarians. How fast was the Oklahoma bomber executed? We have special laws punishing people who commit crimes against people of different faiths simply because they are of different faiths.

I just have a problem with people who can't disagree without resorting to violence.

Across the globe, people resorting to violence in disagreement is the norm. Only in the superior armed west that it is not the norm.

I guess the only question I have is, "Why did they arrest the teacher and not the students also?".
Hey!, or may the parents of the students!
If its a crime to name a teddy bear after Mohammed, then maybe the parents should be arrested for not teaching their kids that it it wrong!
What a joke!!! I guess we can't expect much out of uncivilized countries!!

snc, Sikh philosophy/ideology/message itself teaches not to divide the world along religious lines. That was the intent of the religion in the first place (to try to diminish the Hindu-Muslim barrier), today, it has been transformed into an organized religion and according to the SGPC (the Sikh body which makes decisions for Sikhism), according to them, I'm not even a Sikh, as I have cut my hair and don't follow all its "Code of conducts" et all. But officially, as per the government, as I have been born in a Sikh family, I'm still a Sikh.   But yes, I do still oppose dividing the world based on religions my friend.
 
 
In India, it maybe surprising to many, but there are Hindus who have Jesus for their name. The name they use is Jesu or Jisu.
 
 
Tronic,

You are merely not an Amritdhari Sikh!
 
 
Its nothing but a one way street for some.

THE Foreign Office has confirmed that the British teacher who let her class name a teddy bear Mohammed has been charged with inciting hatred and insulting religion in Sudan.  

Khartoum north prosecution unit has completed its investigation and has charged the Briton Gillian (Gibbons) under Article 125 of the criminal code, state media SUNA said quoting a senior Justice Ministry official.

Gillian Gibbons is expected to appear in court on Thursday.

She faces 40 lashes or six months jail if convicted of insulting Islam.

Foreign Secretary David Miliband is to summon the Sudanese ambassador as a matter of urgency.

Prime Minister Gordon Browns spokesman said: We are surprised and disappointed by this development and the Foreign Secretary will summon as a matter of urgency the Sudanese ambassador to discuss the matter further.

Mr Browns spokesman said the purpose of the meeting was so we can get a clear explanation for the rationale behind the charges and a sense of what the next steps might be.

We will consider our response in the light of that.

Gillian had previously told British Embassy officials she was being well-treated.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said officials from the British Embassy had been to see the 54-year-old earlier today.

A spokeswoman said: We have seen Mrs Gibbons and she said she was being well-treated.

She added that efforts to secure the release of the mother of two were continuing.

A pupil of the teacher leapt to her defence yesterday.

The seven-year-old said he suggested the name  after HIMSELF, not the Islamic prophet.

And he says he would be upset if jailed Gillian Gibbons never came back to teach at Unity High School in Sudans capital Khartoum.

Punishment... teacher could
face 40 lashes
The lad, who spells his name Mohammad, said: The teacher asked what I wanted to call the teddy. I said Mohammad, after my name.

He added that most of his class agreed with his choice and described Gillian, of Liverpool, as a very nice teacher who never mentioned religion in class.

His mum added: Im annoyed that this has escalated in this way. If it happened as he said, then there is no problem here  it was not intended.

Before the charge, Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday vowed to free mum-of-two Gillian as she prepared to spend a third night behind bars.

He said: I feel very sorry about what has happened to Gillian.

I understand she has not yet been charged with any offence.

We will continue to be in contact with the Sudanese authorities so that she can be released soon.

The last Briton to be flogged abroad told of the horrifying pain Gillian may face. Gavin Sherrard-Smith was convicted of selling alcohol illegally in Qatar in 1994 and given 50 lashes with a bamboo cane.

Gavin, of Camberley, Surrey, has always protested his innocence. He says: I'm sure Gillian didn't go over there with any intention of causing offence to anyone.

"But it is a different world and different laws apply.

"It's not just the physical pain Gillian will experience, it is the mental aspect.

"It was about half way through my sentence that I was flogged, but before it actually happened they kept putting it off.

At one stage I was given a medical and was told I was medically unfit to take the flogging.

"I kept being told it wouldn't happen, and at one point I was told it definitely wasn't going ahead.

"A week later I was flogged."

On the day of the lashings, Gavin was looked over by a doctor who checked his heart to see if he was fit.

He was searched to ensure he was wearing no padding and then led to a room where he had to listen to the prisoner ahead of him being lashed.

When it was his turn he was taken into a room and told to lie face down on a rug.

He says: "It was agony. I was told to lay face down on the floor and immediately it started.

"They use a bamboo cane about 10 mm wide and a metre to a metre and a half long.

"They start at your shoulders and go down to the calves and back again until they are finished.

They were counting in Arabic so I couldnt understand them. I tried to count the lashes myself, but after a while it was just too painful.

"All I remember is that it was extremely painful at the beginning. Then your body just goes numb with the pain.

"I was shaking from the pain after they finished and I was frustrated with myself because I didn't want to show them the intense pain I was in.

"It was over really quickly, and for about a minute after I was so thankful it was over that I couldn't feel the pain.

"But then the stinging really kicked in again.

"It didn't leave any permanent damage as it doesn't break the skin, but afterwards my back was covered in welts which stayed there for about two weeks.

I couldt lie on my back for the first week afterwards. "

Gavin said he believes his constant protests of innocence are what led to his punishment.

He says: "I think that if I had admitted the charge they wouldn't have flogged me, but I refused to admit something I was innocent of."

Gavin says what got him through his time in prison and his flogging was the thought of his girlfriend Loida, who he later married.

He says: "She visited me in prison, which was brave as we weren't married.

"She alerted everyone to what was going on and kept me going"

The couple have now been married for twelve years, and have two children. Russell, seven, and Sade, five. Gavin is also step father to Loida's daughter Joanne, 20.

Despite his ordeal, Gavin holds no animosity towards the religion of Islam.

He says: It was the distortion of the religion that shocked me and that happens in all religion.

Pals of Gillian last night told of their concern for the travel-mad divorcee  who started a two-year contract at the school where she also lived just two months ago.

Gill Langworthy, who taught with her at Garston Primary School in Liverpool, said: Im constantly worried. Thinking about her in the cell is horrible. But she has a fighting spirit.

Gill is praying she can come home to spend Christmas with her children Jessica, 27, and John, 25.

Last night a spokesman for the Sudanese embassy in London said he believed the teacher would be cleared and the minute issue resolved very quickly.

When asked about the potential punishments Dr Khalid al Mubarak said: The whole thing could probably be settled long before we reach stages like these.

Maybe they were. I wouldn't put it past them. But then the parents are muslims are locals so BBC doesn't report it.  

 

Of course the BBC reported it. They were the ones who broke the story in the first place!
 
 
 
I do not like this kind of accusatory posts?
but why red cross ?(like you ask why red crescent)

 

They started it? Asians don't have a problem with the Red Cross. Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and Indians didn't demand to have their own little clique like the Red Buddha or something like that. Red Cross is welcome there.

Yes you do.

I don't see christians scream being insulted every single day. Proportionally, muslims cause more trouble.

So you demand the world to define freedom by your standards.

 
if so,it means Danish Gov.t have lost his sovereignty over Denmark.
it is clear that they have to regulate their laws in order to provide social peace in their country.

 

Yes, change laws due to new comers with a different set of standards. Wonderful. Let's see some muslim nations do that. I demand a public school in a muslim nation to serve me pork. And turn off the prayer calls because it distubs my nap time.

 
What do you think about yourself at the moment?

i think you might want to use another example other than the red cross-red crescent deal. IIRC, the israelis wanted to use the "red crystal" (which by the way is recognized), now they changed to the "red star of david" (that too is recognized), the indians wanted to use the "red swastika", iran back when it was persia used the "red lion" (that too was recognized), the USSR wanted to use a combination of the red cross and the red crescent...

so yeah- everyone's petty, one way or another.
 
 
Don't you guys know!! According to the Koran, it is "O.K." to name a human "Muhammad", but not a teddy bear. "IT IS WRITTEN!!!"
No..No...just kidding. This whole thing is nothing but a joke!
In my opinion, if the teacher is going to be flogged and put in prison, then maybe the children's parents should be too for not properly teaching their kids the proper way to respect Muhammad and "NOT NAME A DAMN TEDDY BEAR AFTER HIM!!!!!!!!!!!"

I understand the reason they claim this is insulting. Koran has something that says there will be no worshipping of idols. That's why there are no depictions of Allah or Mohammad anywhere.

But come on, no one's gonna worship a teddy bear for the same reason no one worships his neighbor named Mohammad.

The taliban took this thing to the limit by blowing up ancient statues of some other religions. Not only do they not allow idols of their religion, they don't want other religion's idols either.

You're right. They are all petty. But I bet no one is offended by the cross more than the muslims. Other culture/people/religion don't have much of a problem. Those that did, didn't last too long (Nazi, Soviet Union).

In my understanding the reason for not having Mohammed's idol or picture is not only this. The early Muslims believed him to be a perfect man. Any likeness of him can not be as perfect as him and hence will be like an insult.

And what Taliban did is not unique in Islamic history. There were tens of thousands of temples destroyed by Muslims in Afghanistan and Northern India (which included Pakistan). The main guy who did this (Mahmud Gazhani) among many others is considered a hero of Islam in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Even though he caused much rapine, murder and destruction in parts now called Pakistan, he is still an Islamic hero.

What Taliban is doing is going back to the basics of Islam. Nothing more nothing less.

moreover,Turkiye can be an example for the tolerance example for immigrants who settled down in Antalya.they demanded the azan (prayer call) to be turn off at the mornings.Their demand was accepted with the consensus of the local people.

Cuz other groups are pretty less compared to muslims frequency.

 

I said "proportionally." Christianity in all forms combine to form the biggest single religious block in the diagram you supplied. I see christians and christianity being ridiculed all the time. I don't see them riot and issue death threats.

 
By the way,do you think,the US is a christian nation?

 

US does not have a national religion. US was founded by christians and christianity is the predominant faith in this country. I am not a christian.

 
do you think the definition given is wrong?then,correct it!

 

Freedom of speech which grants you the right to practice islam in our nation also grants us the right to make fun of your religion. You are free to make fun of our religion in our country. Rioters and people who issue death threats will be dealt with, harshly.

 
first of all,you should learn how to demand.
then,your demand can be taken into consideration.you cant have all the things you want.if your demands are proper,and do not cause society to disturb,why not?I mean,government has to give a decision for the situation,break-even point should be found for the goodness of the society.opportunity cost should be found…

 

I agree. We should know how to demand. We demand to have the right to preach and practice any religion in a muslim nation. Turn us down and you face massive riots and protests...wait...there aren't anyone of different faiths in muslim nations who dare to protest. Those who did were killed.

 
between,there is nothing called "muslim nation".at least,I do not consider so called muslim countries as an example for "muslim nation" term.

 

I don't understand this. Saudi Arabia is not a muslim nation? Pakistan? Indonesia? Syria? Iran?

 
moreover,Turkiye can be an example for the tolerance example for immigrants who settled down in Antalya.they demanded the azan (prayer call) to be turn off at the mornings.Their demand was accepted with the consensus of the local people.

 

I applaud Turkey's secular policy. Only if other muslim nations can be as progressive.

 
p.s:I explained why it is accepted as an absurd behaviour by muslims,at least by me, to name after a teddy bear as Mohammad.how do you expect the peace to spread between people if you insist on not respecting others’ sensitivenesses.

 

We think lots of things muslims do are absurd, but we tolerate them. We are even "sensitive" to muslim needs. If it were up to me, muslim terrorists in jail get nothing but 3 meals a day. He'll eat the same thing our troops eat. If it's pork on menu, deal.

 
irrelavant.

 

Oh really? Can I draw a portrait of Mohammad? And worship him? That's my new religion. It combines islam and idolitry. How do you like that? Do I have the freedom to make my own religion in my country?

 
the people I know and I have no problem with the red cross?
but I have the right to question?why an emergency organization with a religious symbol?what is the aim?the same question for the red crescent is on the carpet!

 

Good for you. Too bad you don't have more power to change the minds of the other 1 billion muslims.

Actually, The Red Swatika, or the Red Wheel; were proposed designs, but both were dropped and the Red Cross was chosen by the Indian government itself.

It is the same case with many countries, even Japan and Thailand chose the Red Cross over locally proposed designs.
 
 
 
why an emergency organization with a religious symbol?what is the aim?the same question for the red crescent is on the carpet!

 

It is NOT based on a religious symbol. The Red Cross is suppose to be the reverse of the Swiss flag; as the country is one with a reputation of being a neutral nation. That is how the Red Cross thing started, it has nothing directly to do with Christianity.
 
 
Sudanese protest, call for British teacher's execution

KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) — Thousands of Sudanese, many armed with clubs and knives, rallied Friday in a central square and demanded the execution of a British teacher convicted of insulting Islam for allowing her students to name a teddy bear "Muhammad."
The protesters streamed out of mosques after Friday sermons, as pickups with loudspeakers blared messages against Gillian Gibbons, the teacher who was sentenced Thursday to 15 days in prison and deportation. She avoided the more serious punishment of 40 lashes.

They massed in central Martyrs Square, outside the presidential palace, where hundreds of riot police were deployed, although they did not try to stop the rally.

A Muslim cleric at Khartoum's main Martyrs Mosque denounced Gibbons during one sermon, saying she intentionally insulted Islam. He did not call for protests, however.

"Imprisoning this lady does not satisfy the thirst of Muslims in Sudan. But we welcome imprisonment and expulsion," the cleric, Abdul-Jalil Nazeer al-Karouri, a well-known hard-liner, told worshippers.

"This an arrogant woman who came to our country, cashing her salary in dollars, teaching our children hatred of our Prophet Muhammad," he said.

I was in glasgow for two years and mind you glasgow is a paradise when it comes idiotic mullah's. I had muslim friends of mine deciding not attend mosque in glasgow, they are too radical and true sympathizer of terror and scares the crap out of an average indian expat muslim.

You are attempting to defend the indefensible, possibly because you belong to a faith and feel that faith should be justified. Common sense should tell us what is permissible, and naming a teddybear after a class member is not a crime in my book. Are you applauding the extreme reaction to this event by the Sudanese? If so, shame on you. They are backward primitives wishing to dwell in the 7th century whilst relying on foreign aid. Perhaps you are trying to avoid a parallel being drawn between this case and Israel.

are you sure they are drawn by muslims really   ?

a quote from the referance site you had given
secondly,

 
Islamic depictions of Mohammed ( especially in Shi'ite areas) continued to be produced.
 

?
that is one of the reasons why I have doubts there were/are any islamic country or nation in the world (after the last Prophet's Era (pbuh))

lastly,
to tell the truth, there are plenty of abstruse sentences in the site.I do not think it is trustworthy.

I am sure,none of the sincere Muslims would never draw His (PBUH) picture and never do.I am not talking about the reasons of it,nor about the exaggrated prohibitions on art...

by the way,I am watching how the things getting worse and foolish in Sudan,and how most of the people react it in a similar manner.being a contemporary individual, I refuse to react ignorantly like they did.what will make me different then if I behave like them?

in my opinion,It would be better not to spread the topic on Islam and Its followers.

 
Why are we sending aid to Sudan again?

wrong- hungry people are so badly off, they just worry about surviving. it is only when one is well-fed and relatively well off that one starts thinking of such abstract ideas as "revenge" or "patriotism".

if the west doesn't feed sudan, then a whole bunch of sudanese die- and it won't really matter to us here, except on a moral scale. but in the end, even that burden doesn't mainly belong to us- it belongs on the scumbags and idiots whom the sudanese have for their leaders.
 
 
 
Why are we sending aid to Sudan again?

 

because if you don't then there would a backlash.

aid is the divine right of poor muslims.And any country which refuses will be vulnerable to fidayeen attacks.

basically it's for your own safety

How about we just nuke the entire Islamic world off the map? A big headache of the free world gone, and the world becomes a much better place. It is the good fortune of the Islamic world that the rest of the world religions are build up on morals and humanity.

It is better being with the poor than being against them.it is ok.
but you missed the vital point that I had intended emphasize.
is it a moral thing to test them by food?got the point?
cutting the aid when they do not have the same idea with you,in addition when they really need it?
in this respect,is the aid, a weapon or warmth of philanthropy?
I do not accuse rich nations who help poor ones,however I am examining for the sake of what this help is being done!

of course,I believe there exist people who help others for the sake of Allah or humanity etc. but,to be more plain, poor people (no matter what their race,belief is) are not animals in the circus that anyone is entitled to tame them by cutting the aid.

Very unfortunate that one has to make such remarks but the hostilities towards the rest of the world are shown by the Islamic world over and over again; and Pakistan probably leads in breeding some of the most radical people. Even moderate Pakistanis, even some of the senior ones of this board, have shown their intolerant views in the past towards other religions and people. Even our dear friend wajahat here, who lasted about 70 sensible, calm, thought provoking posts eventually poured his heart out and showed his true self with comments such as:

 
look guys i don't care what an ideal india was meant to be

the point is that by 2020 india will become an muslim majority country. & it is about time that you guys accept this reality

my suggestion is, convert to islam.

embrace islam, the most peaceful religion in the world & you will attain inner peace

stop fighting for a lost cause

 

(btw, does this not go against Forum rules?)

 
if indians feel mistreated in malaysia,they should go back to tamilnadu

anyways the percentage of ethnic indian population in malaysia has dropped to about 7% down from 12% a decade ago, so it makes all the mores sense for them to migrate

however if they still want to stay put then they should convert to islam in order to avoid discrimination

we all know that muslims of indian origin in malaysia are better off than their hindu counterparts

 

Now snc, the Islamic world is very much intolerant, just look at the thread we are on now. Ofcourse, the Islamic world does not include progressive Muslim states such as Turkey, as that is one muslim country which identifies itself and its people as all other in the world and keeps religion out of public life, as it should be!
 
 
 
because if you don't then there would a backlash.

Another idiotic comment but then nothing better can be expected from this guy!

Just a simple question that can be understood by a person with an IQ IN SINGLE DIGITS. Why don't the Arab states with all their unearned money take care of these Muslims? They have enough money to build mosques spreading terror ideology in Non-Muslim lands but not for their own starving Islamic brethern! The Arabs should be the first target of their fidayeen attacks as they are responsible for this mess in the first place.
 
 
 
(btw, does this not go against Forum rules?)

 

It does, yes.
 
 
OK so that is why he was banned.

He was initially sensible, but then leopards can't change their spots?

Was the teacher's name Goldilocks?
 
 
According to cnn she has been pardoned

I got your point.but keep in mind Turkiye is not a Muslim country,we are secular.
every type of belief exists in Turkiye and people are free what to choose.

btw,the intolerant ones cannot be Muslim,so Muslims are not intolerant. (according to Islamic philosophy)
those people are ignorant. explicitly,in my opinion,this is not their fault directly.
most of the so called muslim leaders are just puppets controlled by external powers.unfortunately, they look for what is good and what is not for theirselves.they do not think very much their society.
that is why kingdom regime still goes on in Saudi.
it is either good for some of the West Govt.s or for those so called Muslim leaders. (Saudi was just an example,indeed there are numerous ones.)
got the point why democracy is not in process in so called muslim countries?
actually,the four caliphates were chosen democratically.this is ironic,is not it?
 
 
 
Teddy row teacher to be released

Teacher Gillian Gibbons is to be released from prison in Sudan after she was jailed for allowing children in her class to name a teddy bear Muhammad.
Mrs Gibbons, 54, from Liverpool, was jailed for 15 days by a court in Sudan.

Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir pardoned her after a meeting with two British Muslim peers.

In a statement, Mrs Gibbons said "I am sorry if I caused any distress". Gordon Brown said he was "delighted and relieved" at the news.

Mrs Gibbons is expected to be released later on Monday and flown back to the UK.

The jailing of Mrs Gibbons has led to an international outcry and has embarrassed the government.

Lord Ahmed thanked the president for granting the pardon and said both he and Baroness Warsi were proud to have been able to help Mrs Gibbons.

"This is a case which is unfortunate, unintentional, innocent misunderstanding, and as British Muslim Parliamentarians we, Baroness Warsi and myself, we feel proud that we've been able to secure Gillian Gibbon's release."

Baroness Warsi read out a statement from Mrs Gibbons.

The statement said: "I have been in Sudan for only four months but I have enjoyed myself immensely.

"I have encountered nothing but kindness and generosity from the Sudanese people. I have great respect for the Islamic religion and would not knowingly offend anyone and I am sorry if I caused any distress.

Baroness Warsi and Lord Ahmed both travelled to Sudan

"I was extremely happy working in Unity High School and there I had made some wonderful friends.

"My class was delighted and were making wonderful progress with their studies. I will miss them terribly and I am very sad to think that they have been distressed by this event.

"I would like to express my sincerest thanks to all who have worked so hard whilst I have been in prison. Thank you also for the messages of support.

"I am looking forward to seeing my family and friends but I am very sorry that I will be unable to return to Sudan and work in Unity High School as the teacher of 2X."

Efforts applauded

Mr Brown said Mrs Gibbons would be released into the care of the British embassy in Khartoum.

"Through the course of Mrs Gibbons' detention I was glad to see Muslim groups across the UK express strong support for her case.

"I applaud the particular efforts of Lord Ahmed and Baroness Warsi in securing her freedom. I am also grateful to our officials for all their work behind the scenes."

Downing St confirmed that Mr Brown spoke to Mrs Gibbons' son John Gibbons on Monday morning.

A spokesman said they talked about the behind the scenes work that had been going on to secure Mrs Gibbons' release.

Speaking to reporters outside his home in Liverpool, Mr Gibbons said: "I've just spoken to the prime minister.

"He called to give me the good news himself and I've spoken to the Foreign Office as well."

One of Mrs Gibbons' former teaching colleagues said he was delighted by her release.

Ibrahim Mogra from the Muslim Council of Britain, told BBC News 24 that the whole saga was very damaging for the image of the Muslim faith.

"Each time we have stories like these, that distort what Islam stands for or misrepresents what the compassion of Muslim law stands for.

"Then we have repercussions and people begin to feel that Islam has no place in modern society, whereas we believe that Islam is for all time to come

"I have not come across one single Muslim in our country who has supported what has happened.''

Protestors march

President Omar al-Bashir has been under pressure from Sudanese hardliners to ensure Mrs Gibbons served her full sentence.

There had even been calls for a retrial and for the sentence to be increased.

Mrs Gibbons had been held in a secret location due to fears for her safety.

She was arrested after a member of staff at Unity High School complained to the Ministry of Education.

Crowds of protesters had marched in the capital Khartoum demanding a tougher sentence for her alleged crime of blasphemy. Some called for her to be executed by firing squad.

The British politicians had meetings with Sudanese government officials, including the foreign minister, over the weekend.

They had been due to return home on Monday, but announced they would stay for a third day, after indications that the weekend's "difficult" meetings had led to progress in the case.

I'm sure he appreciates the abbreviation.
 
 
I have to applaud the Sudanese government for being sensitive to western standards. It was probably the best compromise possible since no one was happy about the situation.
 
 
Sensitive as in "if we don't let her go, the repercussions and lack of Aid will cripple the Country".?

She lived confined in a government rest house.

 
Teddy teacher bears Sudan no grudge

GETHIN CHAMBERLAIN, DAVID HARRISON AND BLAKE EVANS-PRITCHARD
Gibbons

Khartoum, Dec. 2: The British teacher jailed in Sudan for naming a teddy bear Mohammed has said that she wished she could stay in the country.

Gillian Gibbons, who faces deportation when she is released, said: “I’m really sad to leave and if I could go back to work tomorrow, then I would.”

In a statement issued through her legal team, Gibbons added: “I’m fine, I’m well, I’m very grateful to all the people who have been working on my behalf. I know so many people out there have done so much.

“I know the Prime Minister called my son and I am really, really grateful to everyone.”

“I want people to know that I have been well treated and especially that I am being well fed.”

Last night, two peers were engaged in a frantic round of diplomacy as they sought to secure Gibbons’s freedom.

Labour’s Lord Ahmed and Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, a Conservative, said they were optimistic about the chances of persuading the Sudanese President, Omar al-Bashir, to release the 54-year-old teacher, but admitted they faced an uphill struggle. “It could be a very long night,” Ahmed said.

Despite street protests against her by hundreds of angry demonstrators, some waving swords, Gibbons expressed gratitude for her treatment.

“I’ve been given so many apples that I feel I could set up my own stall. The guards are constantly asking if I have everything I need,” she said.

“The Sudanese people in general have been pleasant and very generous and I have had nothing but good experiences in my four months here.”

Gibbons, who is being held in a government-owned house in the capital, Khartoum, with access to her own room and bathroom, spent more than an hour yesterday talking to the British peers.

“I don’t think they took her to prison because they did not want her to come away with an even worse opinion of Sudan,” a member of her legal team said.

In a telephone call to her son John in Liverpool, Gibbons said: “I don’t want any resentment towards Muslim people.”

Her son said it had been a relief to hear from his mother. “She’s holding up quite well,” he said. “It’s made me feel a lot better… we chatted for a reasonable length of time and she didn’t seem too distressed.”

He said he had spoken to David Miliband, the UK foreign secretary, who had assured him that diplomats were doing all they could.

Same thing really Ray Sir, confined is confined, and now deported back to liverpool amidst all the yellow ribbons wrapped around the old oak trees,,,, what a load of #ollocks, about somethin as trivial as this,ITS a teddy bear for CHRISTS sake, a frekin kids comforter, and all they can do is shout for her execution, the backward set of TW#ATS  
 
 
One prefers house arrest, with apples to start a stall, to being in a cold dank, mouldy, mildewed cell!

I have been confined to lines but never been in a cell, though inspected them!  

The Sudanese are more civilised than, let us say, others.  

Let us thank God for small mercies and not look at a gift horse in the teeth and demand that they be of gold!    

PBUY (Peace Be Upon You)!
 
 
LONDON - A British teacher jailed in Sudan for letting her students name a teddy bear Muhammad as part of a writing project arrived home Tuesday after being pardoned and said she was "very upset to think that I might have caused offense to people."

Gillian Gibbons told reporters after arriving at London's Heathrow Airport that she was looking forward to seeing her family and friends.

It was a simple misunderstanding, due to cultural & religious differences.

I seriously doubt that the teacher had the intent to blaspheme the Muslim Prophet.

Were I the School's Superintendant, I would have pulled her to the side & explained why naming a teddy bear, or anything other than male humans, was considered so wrong in their culture. Then I would have asked the concerned parents to attend a session where the teacher apologized to them for her actions & lack of cultural & religious knowledge. Likewise, I would have had the teacher explain to the class why what she/ they did was considered wrong.

This whole episode was made much more sensitive when the media was notified. While I'm glad there is a media to inform me of happenings I might not otherwise learn about, they can (& DO--at least in my country) take things too far--for sales of their "product."

& yes, incarceration is incarceration. But what were they supposed to do...just allow her to walk free? The Sudanese Government just might have been looking out for her own welfare by housing her as they did, until the situation could be diffused.

I think the situation was handled as well as can be expected, after the media was able to put their spin on things & blow this simple misunderstanding far out of proportion. & I hope the lessons have been learned.

This is a wind-up, yes?   I don't believe you can mean any of this.  
 
 
What hasn't been mentioned in this thread is that the whole naming Teddy Bear incident actually happened in September and it was not the parents who complained about said bear. The complaint apparently came from a former employee of the school who was disgruntled at their treatment and wanted to attack the school (rather than the teacher it would seem).

The religion may change, the country may change, but the same pettyness exists the world over, it would seem.

Of course in all the controversy there has been one forgotten victim :-  Surreal Scoop: Muhammad Teddy Bear to be flogged 
 
 
I know I only posted once on this thread, but isn't it funny how Muslims, Buddhists, Etc can go to any Christian country and say whatever they want about other GODS and get away with it, but if a "NON-MUSLIM" person asks a bunch of Muslim children what they want to name a teddy bear..........the whole country wants to put that person to death!!!
Hmmmm!!! Think about what Christian countries would do if they thought that way "TODAY"!!!!!
 
 
I don't know how legit this is.

 School Scraps Nature Course As Pigs Enrage Muslim Pupils 

 
School Scraps Nature Course As Pigs Enrage Muslim Pupils

AMSTERDAM, 27/04/07 - A school in Amsterdam has halted lessons on rural life because the Islamic children refused to talk about pigs. Reporting this, Alderman Lodewijk Asscher said he wants to take "tough measures." Subsidies for all kinds of dubious groups must stop and parents of unruly children penalised financially.

Asscher told newspaper De Volkskrant: "A primary school in Amsterdam-Noord has decided no longer to teach about living on a farm. Various pupils began to demolish the classroom when the pig came up for discussion. Apparently it has gone that far. These children, 9, 10 years old, have not been given even the most elementary rules at home about why they must go to school."

Asscher, who is also the Labour (PvdA) leader in Amsterdam, wants to subject the parents to an 'upbringing requirement,' enforced with negative financial spurs. He is thinking of cuts in the children's allowance or lower welfare payments. In the Lower House, Youth and Family Minister Rouvoet recently rejected a plea for this from Party for Freedom (PVV).

Asscher also wants to prune the forest of subsidies for all kinds of foundations and organisations that say they work for multicultural goals. They receive 160 million euros annually from Amsterdam. Asscher wants to work out for each of these organisations in the "welfare industry" whether they do useful work and if not, halt the subsidy.

Asscher gave an example of abuse: "A Moroccan man took 50 youths off the streets, who were really an enormous nuisance. Now they collect wheelchairs for the handicapped in Surinam, Morocco and Turkey. Suddenly, a welfare body was set up alongside him, which is now trying to take the boys over from him, because they would then receive subsidies of 4,000 to 6,000 euros per kid. They are too timid to take these lads of the street themselves and now want them in their card-index because of the subsidy. Our Moroccan volunteer does not want to do it any more. I understand him."

Asscher is also shocked by the powerlessness of welfare bodies who try to talk criminal youngsters back onto the right track. In Slotervaart district, a mother of 10 children, of whom half have a criminal record, is guided by 35 different social workers, the alderman discovered. They have little or no idea of what each other is doing, according to Asscher.
 

There'll be hell to pay if I can't eat ham and bacon at my local breakfast diner because some muslims complained. I mean seriously, hell to pay.

Unbelievable. 9 year old kids indulging in this behavior!!!

Now I think I can believe the Muslims when they say that every child is born Muslim. They have to LEARN to be civilized.
 
 
Calm down guys, you're starting to sound like an inverse PDF. (the original)

Muslim kids go to my daughters school and none of them tear the place up, nor do they have a problem with the petting zoo. We've got a lovely young Muslim woman boarding with us while she goes to our University here (full fee-paying student, paid for by her government) and she has no problem with us having bacon and ham in the fridge.
Sure there's a problem with PC'ness and the PC brigade love to outrage you but you're becoming prey to the crap going on in Europe. Remember what both Dale and I predict about Europe: within the next ten to twenty years they'll have the ovens cranked up again.
Most of these outrageous 'bad behaviour by Muslims stories' are trotted out as part of that buildup: the problem isn't going to be the Islamisation of Europe, it's going to be stopping Europeans wiping out the Muslims.
We've got problems here too: the bloody Maoris constantly moan, the bloody Pakeha constantly pull dodgy deals, the bloody Asians can't drive for sh*t, the bloody Indians own all the dairies and bloody Islanders couldn't do a days work to save their lives. In other words, we're all as bad as each other.
 
 
I dont think for one second that Muslim people/kids are any more crazy than any other group. The problem is if anyone else tried this sort of thing, they would just get slapped down and told not to be such a silly person.

Everyone seems to be scared of even the slightest argument with either the Muslim community as a whole, or even an individual.

That's because in the UK the indigenous population has been brainwashed by government-inspired Political Correctness   The new laws on 'religious hatred' further confuses the issue.   New Labour (spit) are trying to legislate common sense out of existance.   They don't use it themselves but it upsets them to see others using it.

I am actually waiting for someone (of any religion) to have a go at me because I am an atheist (I often have debates with people because I cant stand people who blindly follow a faith just because their Father did), because the laws on religious hatred should apply to everyone, and I want to see if that law applies to my religious belief (my belief being that I have none).

Trust me, I have undulged in several of those debates, you don't wish to go there. The sheer ignorance of it will drive you mad! Often, the answer to "why do you follow it?" is mostly, "because its the truth!" and the answer to "how do you know?" is usually "faith!". Nevermind the fact that one can also have "faith" in a fairy land or a wonderland.

Exactly. The PC brigade or p rovo c ateurs as we knew em in my day   love stirring up shyt.
Take any group, set em up as 'special' and 1: that group believes it and demands more of the same and 2: the rest of the population resents it.
Europe (and for a while nz's) problem is that the provocateurs currently have legislative clout. You really do need a good old fashioned dose of toryism.

The maori and pakeha parts of me are in constant conflict. One part wants to lie on my couch and the other wants to swap it for some beads and a musket then demand it back and lie on it.

Well so far the religious hate laws seem to not have trodden on common sense. As much as I hate them, that BNP-inciting-religious-hatred case was nonsense and it was only correct that they were acquitted.
