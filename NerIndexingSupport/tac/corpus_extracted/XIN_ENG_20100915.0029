A Syrian-French archeological expedition team found on Tuesday a hawk sculpture
dating back to the 10th millennium B.C. , the oldest of its kind ever been
discovered, the Syrian official SANA news agency reported Wednesday.

The sculpture, 5.4 cm long and 5.3 cm wide, was unearthed during the excavation
work in Belaas, Hama, 200 kilometers to the north of the Syrian capital
Damascus.

The discovery proves that Syria is the first to use the hawk as the official
republican symbol for the country Syrian Arab Republic (SAR), said Bassam
Jamous, director of the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums.
