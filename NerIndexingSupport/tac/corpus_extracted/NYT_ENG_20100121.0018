Sen.-elect Scott Brown, R-Mass., said in his victory speech that
he was eager to get to Washington and start his new job. But Brown,
who owes his victory to independent voters, will find himself at
the center of a partisan typhoon over the fate of the major health
care legislation.

At his victory speech, the crowd chanted "Forty-one! Forty-one!
Forty-one!" -- a reference to Brown's role as the 41st Republican
senator, which will deny Democrats the 60 votes they need to
overcome Republican filibusters and advance legislation, including
the health care bill.

And Brown has promised to do just that -- to block the health
care legislation and force Democrats to start over. But given that
he must rely on independent voters in his heavily Democratic state,
Brown, who will be up for re-election in 2012, may find political
peril in becoming the high-profile 41st foot soldier in the Senate
Republicans' battle against the health care legislation.

The health care bill is President Barack Obama's top domestic
priority, and Obama remains popular in Massachusetts. And Brown's
record on health care issues in the state is likely to come under
intense scrutiny.

Brown, as a state senator, voted in favor of the Massachusetts
universal health care law in 2006, and has sought to portray it as
fundamentally different from the congressional legislation. But
Massachusetts was actually an important model for what Congress has
developed, arguably the model for what Congress envisions.

The federal law, like the one in Massachusetts, is built around
a system of government-subsidized, private insurance coverage with
subsidies on a sliding-scale based on income. The federal law,
however, also includes a number of national steps aimed at
controlling health care costs, and new taxes and fees aimed at
paying for the legislation. Massachusetts has continued to struggle
with its costs.

The online marketplace, or exchange, where Massachusetts
residents can shop for health insurance was a model for the
exchanges included in the House and Senate versions of the health
care legislation.

So as Brown gets ready to head to Washington, he can expect to
be pressed further on exactly what he views to be the differences
between the Massachusetts plan and the legislation developed by
Democrats in Washington.
