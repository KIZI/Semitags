The Czech Republic's counterintelligence service says the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's regime was planning to use an anti-tank rocket to attack the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Prague.

The Czech Security Information Service, or BIS, said in a statement Monday it learned in 2000 that Saddam ordered the attack.

The radio began broadcasting to Iraq in 1998.

The attack was supposed to have been carried out by Iraqi spies from a window of an apartment building near the radio's location in downtown Prague.

The Czech agency said the Iraqi spies smuggled in weapons for the attack, including an anti-tank missile RPG-7, six machine guns and ammunition in a diplomatic vehicle.
