Civil rights groups have sued the U.S. government to learn more about the surveillance of international e-mails and telephone calls.

The American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday, calling the secret snooping "spying."

The lawsuit asks the court to force the government to release information about what resulted after a 2008 change in law gave the government broader powers to eavesdrop on Americans communicating with people internationally. The ACLU says monitoring the phone calls and e-mails of Americans should require a court warrant.

Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for government lawyers, declined to comment.
