 
 
BIN LADEN is DEAD!!!!
 
 
Praise the Lord justice was dispersed, under Obama's jurisdiction.  
 
 
It was inevitable.
 
 
No one else is THRILLED Bin Laden was brought to justice?
 
 
@JGoldman10,

I don't think thrilled is the right word. A better way to feel would be wary. Al Qaida is not a top down organisation, it's more of a symbol. Bin Laden will now be viewed as a martyr, and now the most tricky period of all begins. Let's just hope his death does not inspire a rush of revenge attacks.

Al Qaida, and those inspired by BinLaden will not go away until the rights of the ordinary Moslems around the world are respected. After 9/11 Bush made a fatal mistake by using the word crusade. This is a word that convinces Moslems that America isn't against terrorism and dictatorships it's against Moslems. Convincing the Moslem world that America is not involved in a crusade is one of the greatest challenges America faces today.

Still, Obama has played a blinder. Bin Laden's had this coming for a long time, be happy and celebrate, but don't let your guard down.
 
 
@izzythepush,

You are right- the word I am looking for is ENTHRALLED.

@H2O MAN,

Osama told his wife just before the hit.
"Im not going to take a shower, Ill just wash up on the beach"

Is Trump demanding to see Ossama's Death Certificate?

How many trillions could we have saved by just doing this in the firast place? Im sure he was easier to find in the early days
 
 
Donald Trump is proud today that he finally convinced Obama to kill Bin Laden.
 
 
@blueveinedthrobber,

I hope that there are a heap of great Osama jokes. EVeryone is taking this like 9/11 was a trifle?

Its times like this that Id wish that there really were a hell and this guy would be on the fast track to the deepest level reserved for evil popes.

 Bin Laden raid years in the making, minutes in execution 

Interesting that the compound was not in the caves and the hills, but inside a suburban city close to Islamabad.
 
 
The tip that landed Usama bin Laden came to light in August. It was a “great lead,” a federal law enforcement source told Fox News.

Officials wouldn’t know how good it was until months later. After an exhaustive streak of intelligence gathering and high-level meetings, that tip resulted Sunday in the death of the world’s most wanted terrorist at U.S. hands.

Though President Obama gave only sparse details of the operation in his surprise address to the nation Sunday night, officials filled in the blanks where they could about the mission that brought to justice the man responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks and countless acts of violence around the world.

Though bin Laden was pursued throughout the George W. Bush administration, President Obama renewed the effort on June 2, 2009, when he signed a memo to CIA Director Leon Panetta ordering a “detailed operation plan” for finding and capturing bin Laden.

More than a year later, what Obama described as a “possible lead” came in. Senior administration officials said they had been tracking an Al Qaeda courier in bin Laden’s inner circle. Two years ago, the U.S. determined the areas in Pakistan where he operated. By August, they had determined the exact location in Abbottabad, Pakistan -- where bin Laden was apparently hiding out in a sprawling compound on the outskirts of town.

One U.S. official said the compound was built over a six-year period. The intelligence community, led by the CIA, concluded it was custom-built to house someone of bin Laden’s stature. It was enclosed by a high wall topped with barbed wire, and protected by two security gates.

Officials said that by February, they determined they would pursue the compound. This touched off a series of high-level meetings to develop a course of action.

According to one senior administration official, the president convened at least nine meetings with his top national security leaders. Those advisers met formally another five times, in addition to countless briefings among the National Security Council, CIA, Pentagon and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The president was actively involved at all levels, the official said.

The federal law enforcement source said that by last week, it seemed “this might be the real deal.”

The president must have felt the same way. At 8:20 a.m. on April 29, before he left for Alabama to survey storm damage, Obama authorized the operation to target bin Laden.

By Sunday, a “small team” of special operations forces was in Pakistan for the final mission. That mission was the all-day focus of national security staff.

According to one official, national security leaders were in the Situation Room since 1 p.m. Sunday. The rest of the afternoon went as follows:

At 2 p.m., Obama met with the team to review final preparations.

At 3:32 p.m., he returned to the Situation Room for an additional briefing.

At 3:50 p.m., he learned that bin Laden had been tentatively identified.

At 7:01 p.m., the president learned there was a “high probability” the target was bin Laden.

At 8:30 p.m., Obama received more briefings.

In Abbottabad, a senior U.S. defense official said the actual operation took place at 3:30 p.m. ET.

Officials said three adult men other than bin Laden were killed – one was believed to be bin Laden’s son, the others couriers. One woman was killed when she was used as a human shield and two other women were also injured, the officials said.

No Americans were killed, though the U.S. did lose a helicopter that went down due to mechanical failure. An official said the Pakistanis were not involved in the raid but helped provide information that led to it. Intelligence was also provided by detainees.

@H2O MAN,

 
The killing of Osama bin Laden will deal a big psychological blow to al-Qaida but may have little practical impact on an increasingly decentralized group that has operated tactically without him for years.

Nearly a decade after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, al-Qaida has fragmented into a globally scattered network of autonomous groups in which bin Laden served as an inspirational figure from the core group's traditional Pakistan-Afghanistan base.

Counter-terrorism specialists describe a constantly mutating movement that is harder to hunt than in its turn-of-the-century heyday because it is increasingly diffuse — a multi-ethnic, regionally dispersed and online-influenced hybrid of activists.

While this network remains a threat, the core al-Qaida leadership has been weakened by years of U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan. It has not staged a successful attack in the West since London bombings that killed 52 people in 2005.

Al-Qaida has also been hurt ideologically by uprisings in the Arab world by ordinary people seeking democracy and human rights — notions anathema to bin Laden, who once said democracy was akin to idolatry as it placed man's desires above God's.

The arm of al-Qaida that now poses the biggest threat to the United States is its affiliate in Yemen, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), according to U.S. officials. Other al-Qaida-linked groups have grown in ambition and lethality.

As a matter of leadership of terrorist operations, bin Laden has really not been the main story for some time," said Paul Pillar, a former senior U.S. intelligence official.

The instigation of most operations has been at the periphery not the center — and by periphery I'm including groups like AQAP but also smaller entities as well."

It was AQAP that claimed responsibility for a thwarted Christmas Day attack aboard a U.S. airliner in 2009 and an attempt last year to blow up two U.S.-bound cargo planes with toner cartridges packed with explosives.

The head of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, Michael Leiter, acknowledged to Congress earlier this year that AQAP and its chief English-language preacher Anwar al-Awlaki posed the biggest risk to the United States.

Al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who left the country in 2001 and joined al-Qaida in Yemen, also communicated with a U.S. Army major who in November 2009 allegedly went on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas that killed 13 and wounded 32.

The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a failed bombing in New York City's Times Square a year ago.

Psychological, political impact
"I don't think there's any real military significance (to bin Laden's death)," said Arturo Munoz, a security analyst at RAND Corporation.

"The significance is political and psychological and psychologically and politically, there's a huge significance."

"Bin Laden's death is a significant victory for the United States. But it is more symbolic than concrete," said Fawaz Gerges, an al-Qaida expert at the London School of Economics.

So far my view of this whole situation has gotten me nothing but anger from others. But, and I am being quite serious here, I don't get it. I remember how people felt when the Muslim countries were rejoicing about the Twin Towers. I remember how people kept saying they were nothing but godless heathens that didn't care about anyone, because they were rejoicing at the deaths of others.

Could someone please tell me what makes us any different if we are rejoicing as they did? Please don't get me wrong. I am not defending anything the man did but how can those that are rejoicing explain how they are not being hypocritical or just as the Muslims were when the Towers came down?

BIN LADEN being dead is a good start
 
 
Thanks to George W. Bush, the information that led to this hiding place came from prisoner interrogations at Guantanamo Bay.
 
 
@Arella Mae,

I was asleep when my husband woke me and told me they killed Bin Laden, I have to admit that my first reaction was gut reaction and I was glad. What that says about me, I don't know. I see your point though about cheering for the death of someone.

Also we have to be careful and not go overboard with self congratulations, one reason is that other branch offs of AQ are still in operation and another reason, we don't want to unnecessarily antagonize Muslims who have been turning away from AQ. I hope the story don't last long.

I don't think we know that yet.

 
“This was a no kidding, CIA and military operation,” said the U.S. official.

“The raid was the culmination of intense and tireless effort on the part of many dedicated agency officers over many years,” Panetta said in a message to CIA employees. “Our men and women designed highly complex, innovative, and forward-leaning clandestine operations that led us to bin Laden. One operation would yield intelligence that was carefully analyzed and then used to drive further operations.

The compound was uncovered after years of effort in which the CIA gathered leads on individuals in bin Laden's inner circle, including his couriers. Some of their names were provided by al Qaida members captured by the U.S.

"One courier in particular had our constant attention," said a second senior administration official, who declined to release his name, but described him as a "protege" of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged architect of the 9/11 attacks who was captured in Pakistan in March 2003 and is in U.S. custody at Guantanamo.

The CIA positively identified the courier four years ago and two years ago identified areas of Pakistan where the courier and his brother were operating. But because they employed such tight operations security, the agency was unable to pinpoint their residence until last August.

The captured al Qaida members only knew the courier's nom de guerre, but they told U.S. intelligence officers that he was "one of the few... trusted by bin Laden," and that the pair might be living together, he continued.

The courier and his brother were tracked to a massive, palatial compound built in 2005 at the end of a dirt road in an isolated and "affluent" suburb of Abbottabad favored by retired Pakistani military officers, said the second senior administration official, who added that it was believed that the residence was constructed specifically for bin Laden.

"We were shocked by what we saw," he said, describing the compound as being eight times larger than any of the area's other homes, surrounded by 12- to 18-foot walls topped by barbed wire. Different sections of the structure were walled off from each other.

The "extraordinary security measures" also included two electrified security gates. Trash was burned before being taken out for disposal, he said.

The compound was built at a cost of $1 million — a great deal for a residence in impoverished Pakistan — yet it had no telephone or Internet connections, and the third floor was surrounded by a "seven-foot privacy wall" for its occupants.

The courier and his brother, meanwhile, "had no explainable source of income," said the second administration official, who added that "we soon learned that more people were living at the compound" than just the two men and their families.

CIA analysts, working with the eavesdroppers of the National Security Agency and experts at the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency, which analyzes satellite imagery, concluded "with strong probability" that a third family — bin Laden, his youngest wife and several family members — also were living there, he said.

The compound's massive security, its isolated location and its size "was consistent with what our experts had expected bin Laden's hideout would look like," he continued. "No other candidate fit the bill as well as bin Laden did."

Apparently the courier who was of such interest was "protege" of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged architect of the 9/11 attacks who was captured in Pakistan in March 2003 and is in U.S. custody at Guantanamo.

From what I can tell, the only thing the captured prisoners (as in plural) knew were the alias of the courier and that the courier were one of the few who were trusted by Bin Laden. It does not say where they were kept in prison and at what point they were captured.

It was four years ago that they positively identified the courier. It was two years ago that they knew where the courier and his brother were operating because they were tracked. They were not able to pinpoint their residence until last august.

I was wondering how the right shrills were going to spin this.

A trifle, was 9-11 a trifle? Measured on the historical scale it only just comes even with Bush's illegal invasion of Panama. But you're not really into accurate comparisons, are you? You're not really interested in any real truth.

Where would that put Reagan for Nicaragua, Bush Jr for Iraq & Afghanistan, Eisenhower for Guatemala, Johnson, Kennedy, Nixon for Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Nixon & Kissinger for Chile, Indonesia.

That doesn't even begin to address the huge supporting staff of war criminals/mass murderers/experts on torture, rape that were/are being paid with your tax dollars.

The list is just too damn long to type out but your hypocrisy is stunning, absolutely fucking stunning!

Do you mean that huge complex in the mountains of Afghanistan that Rumsfeld warned all you highly gullible Americans about years ago to try to frighten you into allowing the invasion and murder of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Afghans?

It was too damp so OBL moved to a dryer climate.
 
 
@H2O MAN,

What was with those college students cheering outside the White House?
 
 
How did the US troops know Bin Laden was in the compound he was hiding in? How did the gov't get ahold of his DNA to determine it was him?
 
 
@JGoldman10,

Extremely good intelligence, and 4 years of digging and intelligence work.

A hair sample, a skin sample, some of his blood, etc.
There are many ways to get someones DNA.
And since his family in Saudi Arabia has disowned him, getting a DNA sample from them was simply a matter of asking.
 
 
@mysteryman,

How do they know it WAS him for certain? He DOES have look-a-likes.

Good greenlighting. Funny that it wasnt done in te pevious seven years even though Bush tried the Tora Bora hit. Obama showed intelligence for not trusting Pakistanis with any of the plqans until it was a done deal.

Your attempted spin is kinda lame.

ALSO, Ill bet that, had this strike gone South, you woulda been pinning it ALL on Obama. History is always made up of lucky breaks that are celebrated by the winners as supwrior strategy and execution.

Obama get well deserved credit for green lighting the mission that was put before
him and I'm glad someone convinced him to make it a kill instead of capture mission.

Not shutting down Gauntonimo bay and not suspending advanced interrogation techniques as
he said he would only supports the work Bush and Cheney did prior to Obama's 1 & only term.

@revelette,

If you watched the live speech Obama made regarding the capture of Bin Laden it was indicated Bush had info regarding it.
 
 
 
The most striking clue so far available about how bin Laden was hunted down appears in the secret Guantanamo assessment file of Abu Faraj al Libi, a Libyan detainee who was named as al Qaida's third most senior leader when he was captured in May 2005.

According to the assessment, al Libi was in contact with a man identified as bin Laden's "designated courier, Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan," in July 2003. The assessment was one of more than 750 obtained by the WikiLeaks website and given to McClatchy and other media organizations.

About that same time, the assessment said, al Libi moved his family to Abbottabad, Pakistan, the same town where bin Laden was killed early Monday during a raid by a U.S. tactical team.

The senior U.S. official confirmed to reporters during a briefing that the courier in question was "a trusted assistant of Abu Faraj al Libi."

Al Libi moved his family out of Abbottabad in mid-2004, the year before the large compound that housed bin Laden was built at the end of a narrow dirt road.

The name of bin Laden's designated courier, al Khaliq Jan, appears to have come from al Libi during 2005 and 2006 interrogations. Al Libi was in CIA custody from shortly after his capture until he was transferred with 13 other "high-value detainees" to Guantanamo in September 2006.

In addition to al Libi, the bin Laden courier was also identified by detainees as "a protege of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of September 11th," who is also now at Guantanamo, according to the senior U.S. official. It was Mohammed's capture in 2003 that pushed al Libi into the position of al Qaida's operational chief, according to al Libi's Guantanamo file.

Bradsher, at the Pentagon, confirmed that Guantanamo detainees had learned of bin Laden's death. Asked about their reaction, she said that "right now, everything continues to be normal."

Official support for the interrogation program in 2002 dissolved during the next year. Understanding that it would be blamed if the interrogation policy entered the public debate, the CIA and Department of Defense curtailed use of the harshest techniques. According to the New York Times, the last instance of a detainee being waterboarded was in March 2003, and the full complement of harsh techniques were officially dropped from use in 2005. [28]

In May 2004, the Inspector General of the CIA, John Helgerson, released a lengthy report that disputed the legality of certain coercive interrogation methods, alleging that interrogators were exceeding Justice Department limits on coercive methods, and challenging the efficacy of the entire coercive interrogation program. In 2005, following on the heels of the abuse scandal at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, a senate bill was passed that banned cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners. [29]

I did watch the speech, the transcript is in  this link. 

The only time Obama mentioned Bush's name was to say he shared Bush's sentiment regarding how we are not at war with Islam.

 
As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not –- and never will be -– at war with Islam. I’ve made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam. Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims. Indeed, al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own. So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.
 

Speaking of what some American Muslims are saying regarding Bin Laden death:

FRONTLINE

Fighting for bin Laden
On air and online
May 3, 2011 at 9:00pm

In the aftermath of the killing of Osama bin Laden, FRONTLINE presents two inside views of the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban. First, Afghan journalist Najibullah Quraishi -- who reported last year's award-winning FRONTLINE film Behind Taliban Lines -- once again journeys deep inside enemy territory. This time, he gains extraordinary access to a band of militants and foreign fighters in Afghanistan who say they're loyal to bin Laden and are readying a Spring offensive against the U.S.

Then, FRONTLINE crosses the border into Pakistan, where correspondents Stephen Grey and Martin Smith go inside The Secret War against the militants. They uncover new details of a CIA "private army" of militiamen launching kill raids against al Qaeda and the Taliban inside Pakistan. They also find new evidence of covert support for elements of the Taliban by the Pakistani military and its intelligence service, the ISI. At a safe-house not far from where bin Laden was killed, they make contact with one mid-level Taliban commander who tells FRONTLINE, "If they really wanted to, [the Pakistanis] could arrest us all in an hour."

@H2O MAN,

All the Bush era personalities are similarly lining up to take part.
NOW, had this gone badly, only Obama would have been taking the hit. SO for that alone, he masterminded something that HAD TO WORK.

Is it hard thinking wioth your head up your ass like that spurt?
Obama had specifically anounced several times the control and main planning responsibilities of this mission. He was VERY specific to state that once the trigger was yanked the entire strategic and logistic effort was the responsibility of the SEAL leadership and the on ground guys themselves.

You were too busy trying to hear out your anal sphincter I guess, or else you were so busy sucking up to FOX-spin that you couldnt process anything else.
 
 
@revelette,

The LIVE BORADCAST mentioned Bush had some info regarding Bin Laden's wherebouts.
 
 
There seems to be an outbreak of rectal cranial inversions with the
libtards here on A2K. The outbreak is widespread and there is no cure.

BTW, what happened to Obama's big bump in the polls?

Too bad, so sad, asswipe:  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/us/politics/05poll.html?hp 

Suck it!
 
 
@JGoldman10,

Does no one remember the video of Porter Goss almost doubling over in laughter when Bush said that he thinks everyday about ways to capture OBL?

I can't recall whether this was before or after Bush said that he didn't worry about OBL anymore.
 
 
It turns out that this was a raid by the DEA... Osama was shot dead for growing Marijuana.
 
 
@JTT,

NO.
 
 
@JGoldman10,

Well, it was funny, J, not to mention telling; telling in the sense of how clear it was to everyone just what a massive liar Bush was, is.
 
 
@JTT,

I didn't care for Bush- he allowed too much mess to go on while he was in Office. I only voted for him because he said he was a Christian.
 
 
@JGoldman10,

You will know them by their fruits.  
 
 
 
 
 
@H2O MAN,

Okay, now that is just sick! It's not funny when anyone dies. Posting that kind of thing makes you just as barbaric because you think it's funny.
 
 
@Arella Mae,

I agree, and Hitler jokes are in bad taste also.

I think the US gov't should focus more on Radical Islam.
 
 
@JGoldman10,

how did hitler tie his shoes?

with knotsies  
 
 
You liberals need to get yourselves a sense of humor and fast because
that's some funny shit right there, that and the shoe laces joke  
 
 
@H2O MAN,

If they brought DC Follies back on TV do you think they would get away with Bin Laden jokes?
 
 
@JGoldman10,

Only if they limited the number of liberals in the audience.

I just took a huge Osama and almost ran out of paper wiping my Obama.
 
 
@JGoldman10,

 
I only voted for him because he said he was a Christian.
 

Yeah, he duped everyone there too.

@H2O MAN,

Lying isn't nothing for the prez of the US. In fact, it's a job requirement just like being a war criminal is.
 
 
@djjd62,

Oh, you naughty boy...    
 
 
@H2O MAN,

Somehow I doubt that Arella Mae and JGoldman10 are liberals. Their reservations are based upon sincere religious conviction.

And I do think the humor is funny.

@wmwcjr,

Like I have said before, how many Americans thought it was funny when the muslims were dancing in the streets when the towers went down? How funny did Americans think it was when they made jokes about our freedoms, etc? If they cannot see that behaving in the same manner is no better than I truly feel sorry for them.
 
 
@Arella Mae,

You have a point... No wonder. You're one of the nicest members here. *thumbs up*
 
 
What is a liberal?
 
 
@JGoldman10,

someone consistent in their in their beliefs.
 
 
@JGoldman10,

Liberal democrats that think they are always right and that everyone else is wrong. Liberals have a false sense of self worth. Liberals have no clue what self reliance means, they are all about big government and spending other peoples money. Liberals are the smug, arrogant, self absorbed type of people your mom warned you about

really ? You're the kind of smug, self important, narrow minded cunt my mother warned me about. Of course, my mother was educated.
 
 
I have heard that they are not going to release the photos of Bin Laden's body. I am rather puzzled by something. They have pictures on the internet of other men that were killed in the raid and they are pretty graphic. I'm not understanding why they would release those photos but not Bin Laden's. It's not that I want to see them, because I don't. I'm just curious. Any ideas?
 
 
@Arella Mae,

yes the other's aren't bin Laden, who has the symbolic importance of being the head of a worldwide terrorist ring, and has been the focus of a 10-yr-search for the mastermind of 9/11 tragedies.
 
 
@Ragman,

 
the other's aren't bin Laden, who has the symbolic importance of being the head of a worldwide terrorist ring,
 

Why should that matter, Ragman? There are pictures of Reagan, Bush and Bush, Kissinger, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy, Eisenhower, Truman,... everywhere.

Individually, they make OBL look like a babe in arms. Collectively, they are responsible for an astounding array of terrorist actions across the world.

Why do you folks just keep lining up to parade your hypocrisy and your ignorance?
 
 
@Arella Mae,

Perhaps the photos you are referring to were taken by the Pakistani an hour after the raid. In which case Bin Laden's body would not have been there to have his photo taken. (not sure)

 
SLAMABAD - Photographs acquired by Reuters and taken about an hour after the U.S. assault on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan show three dead men lying in pools of blood, but no weapons.

The photos, taken by a Pakistani security official who entered the compound after the early morning raid on Monday, show two men dressed in traditional Pakistani garb and one in a t-shirt, with blood streaming from their ears, noses and mouths.

The official, who wished to remain anonymous, sold the pictures to Reuters.

Okay- the man is gone. LET'S MOVE ON.
 
 
One of the things I find interesting is that the demand for the images are by and large coming from the right.... the family values people. I guess they're okay with these images being all over the media and the news for their young children to see as long as they don't see a bare tit.

Really? Because your mom keeps warning me about your dad. Guess he must be liberal. Or really jealous.

The story behind this story, A STEALTH HELICOPTER.
Super quiet, very tiny heat signature and radar stealthy. Too bad these things can be seen like Christmas tree ornaments.
 
 
@JGoldman10,

Yes, it's time to move on. There are countries to pillage, children upon which to to spread depleted uranium, adults to torture, women to rape.

BUG OFF.

RADICAL ISLAM is a MUCH BIGGER THREAT to the US than the Al Qaeda.
 
 
@JGoldman10,

 
RADICAL ISLAM is a MUCH BIGGER THREAT to the US than the Al Qaeda.
 

Much brighter folk [and lots of dumber ones] than you have repeated this old canard time and time again, J.

Ask yourself; if they are such a big threat, why is it that the score is a couple million Middle Easterners to a few thousand Americans?

Seems like the same "big" threat that America has had to face from those ever dangerous Nicaraguans, or the constant invasions that the Vietnamese have launched on the US west coast, or the Cubans, now there's a dangerous bunch; have they taken Florida yet?
 
 
@JGoldman10,

Yep, and Barry Obama is a much bigger threat to the US than radical Islamic terrorists and Al Qaeda combined
 
 
@H2O MAN,

Tell that to the families of 9/11 victims, asshole.
 
 
@H2O MAN,

Explain why [I don't want to make this too difficult for you] in one sentence or less.
 
 
@Gargamel,

They are fully aware of the clear and present danger that is in the White House today
 
 
@H2O MAN,

I see that you've even used some buzzwords, "clear and present danger", without understanding what they mean.

You get an F, but you have a chance to rewrite your "essay". Don't blow it, h2oman. I'm speaking figuratively here but perhaps if you spent less time sucking Hannity, Limbaugh,... and thinking for yourself, I know, I know, completely radical concept that you just aren't prepared to deal with.

Okay, just do your homework. Plagiarize from any nut source you want.
 
 
@JTT,

Radical Islam is a BIG THREAT to the ISREALIS and the THE CHRISTIAN WORLD. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

DO NOT TRY TO INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE.

You probably DON'T WATCH TBN OR ANY CHRISTIAN NETWORK so YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
 
 
@JGoldman10,

I dont think I would be any more interested in being brain washed by christian or jewish radicals than Islamitic radicals. They are all the same in that the only truths they know are in their closed minds.
 
 
@RABEL222,

Global studies or current events is not my FORTE- that doesn't make me an idiot.

Go impose your SECULARISM on someone else.

Do I detect a contradiction here, J?  
 
 
@JTT,

I am not an EXPERT on these things. I am IGNORANT of them that doesn't make me STUPID.

I am more into Christianity, God, the Bible, art, math and science.
 
 
@JGoldman10,

I agree. You saw my smiley face.

If you are ignorant of these things, then don't you think it wise to either refrain from comment or ask questions to get up to speed?
