The Central African Republic's National Assembly voted 95 against six with one
abstention to adopt a government bill on Monday to extend the term of deputies
and President Francois Bozize, which expires on June 11.

The extension of the mandate came after the country postponed twice its planned
elections amid sharp disputes over the pre-vote preparations, with the
opposition threatening a boycott unless the polls are put off to next year.

According to the newly adopted constitutional provisions, in case of "delays in
the holding of the elections before the end of the terms of the president and
the National Assembly, the president of the republic will ask the Constitutional
Court to allow the outgoing president to continue exercising his powers until
the organization of elections."

The new article 50 provides that "the National Assembly will remain in office
until the end of the electoral process if during its term, some unforeseen or
unavoidable circumstances delay elections."

"We have saved the Central African Republic from any unforeseen crisis," Speaker
of the National Assembly Leroy-Celestin Gaombalet noted.

The adoption of this bill happened after a controversy between the ruling
coalition and the opposition calling for a political arrangement to preserve the
Constitution and guarantee civil peace.

Regrouped under a platform dubbed the Collection of Change Forces (CFC), the
opposition decided on May 5 to meet with the mediator in the country's crisis,
Paulin Pomodimo, "with a view of him intervening in the crisis of legitimacy of
the state power."

CFC had already decided to pull out of the electoral process to protest against
what they considered as ill preparation for the presidential and legislative
elections.

A joint commission that was set up to examine this bill recommended that the
Independent Electoral Commission formulate the electoral timetable, draft a
budget for the elections and fix the date of the elections through consensus.

The government has been asked to engage in dialogue with all groups that are
involved in the electoral process in order to guarantee a peaceful political
climate, while the international community has been asked to redouble their
effort in resource mobilization, so that the electoral process can be completed
successfully.

The country decided on April 29 to postpone elections sine die after an earlier
delay from April 25 to May 16. The opposition is currently complaining about the
poor preparation before elections, but in fact tensions have existed since the
forming of government in early 2009.

Critics say the government is approximately the same as before the national
dialogue in December 2008, while persistent rebel movements still occupy parts
of the territory, especially in the north.

The opposition grouping of Forces for Change has called on the country's
population to boycott the elections if they are not postponed to January 2011,
demanding the disarmament of rebels before holding any elections.

In March, the government said it had foiled a coup attempt by soldiers and
politicians to topple President Bozize.

The president dismissed two cabinet ministers and the presidency spokesman in
April amid difficulties in preparation for elections.

The Central African Republic won its  independence from France in 1960. The
land-locked country has witnessed a series of coups and revolts, affecting a
quarter of its 4 million population including 200,000 displaced.

On March 15, 2003, Bozize, currently the outgoing president, overthrew Ange
Felix Patasse in a military coup. Bozize then won a five-year term in the last
presidential election in 2005.

Patasse has come back from exile in Togo and is considered as a formidable
opponent to Patasse in the run-up to the elections. Rumors said he was behind
the failed coup attempt in March, although the authorities did not made any
comments.

The United Nations and regional countries have maintained peacekeepers in the
Central African Republic, which is rich in timber, gold, diamond and uranium
resources, but ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world.
