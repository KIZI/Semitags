Posted on | September 21, 2011 | No Comments

I just talked to the clerk of the court in HI. Initially, on September 16 my code did not work for electronic filing, so I submitted my pleadings via FedEx. The clerk stated, that the pleadings submitted on September 16th by one day delivery, were received only yesterday, they will be docketed today and a copy was already forwarded to judge Puglisi. Hearing is scheduled for

The pleadings in DC case before judge Lamberth were docketed. I asked for 20 days emergency hearing. No date yet.

The pleadings in the state case in HI before judge Nishimura are not due until October the 2nd. The hearing is scheduled for October 12th.

There is no decision from the panel of judges Pregerson, Berzon and Fisher in the 9th circuit yet.

I will be leaving for DC today and will have 5 congressional meetings on Thursday

I will keep you appraised of further developments.

So getting bitch-slapped by Obama's long form BC wasn't enough embarrassment for you? I guess you're a glutton for punishment. Good luck.

How is this lunatic allowed to waste so many judges time? I know everyone is entitled to their day in court, but this is ridiculous. They should all be consolidated into one case, and just get it over with.

 President Obama's Long Form Birth Certificate | The White House 

I just have a question. Why use the name "Kenya" on the Certificate of Birth, which was created in 1961, when in 1961, Kenya was still known as "The British East Africa Protectorate, up until 1963? I'm just curious. I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation. Did I miss something?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kenya's Name

Kenya - a wonderful sounding word is named after a mountain of the same name. It was given by the Kikuyu people who lived around present day Mt. Kenya which they referred to as Kirinyaga or Kerenyaga, meaning ‘mountain of whiteness’ because of its snow capped peak (yes, Africa does have snow capped peaks). Mt Kirinyaga which was the main landmark became synonymous with the territory the British later claimed as their colony. However, the name Kenya arose out of the inability of the British and others to pronounce Kirinyaga correctly.

When one hears the name "Kenya," there are images of the savannahs, animals, safari trips, the Rift Valley, the Indian Ocean coastline and Lake Victoria but Kenya is over (2003 estimate) 30 million people of various ethnic groups (47) and backgrounds and without having met the people of Kenya, one has not seen the real, living Kenya.

Early Visitors and Settlers

The first people to settle in Kenya were indigenous African communities who migrated from various parts of the continent (Kenya is made up of various people groupings). Other visitors included traders, explorers, missionaries, slave-traders and travelers who came in from various parts of the world such as Portugal, Arabia, Roman empire, India, Greece and as far as China. They visited mainly the East African Coast from as early as the first century A.D. While the majority of the visitors went back to their countries, some settled, and intermarried with the local populations giving rise to a new Swahili culture along the Coast which has a strong Arabian flavor.

The civilization base of craft industries, farming, fishing and international trade gave rise to both Coastal city states such as Siu, Pate, Lamu, Malindi, Gede, Mombasa and Vanga. Islam and Kiswahili language were also introduced. The traders from overseas brought such items as clothes, beads, wines, iron weapons, porcelain and handicrafts. These were exchanged for ivory, timber, gold, copper, rhinoceros horns, animal skins and slaves. (Slaves from Kenya were taken to Zanzibar and shipped from there to various parts of the Arabian peninsula and there is evidence of slaves as far away as China and India.)

The first major European presence in East Africa started with the arrival of the Portuguese in the East African waters in 1498 when Vasco Da Gama ’s fleet made its initial forays on its way to the East Indies. On the first voyage his only negotiations were with the ruler of Malindi and, indeed, for the next hundred years this alliance was the foundation of the Portuguese network in the region. Their quest to control and dominate the lucrative Indian Ocean trade, the conquest of several city-states along the coast, and the establishment of their dominance, lasted 200 years. (The Portuguese forts can still be seen in various states of decay on the coast of Kenya.)

Colonial Rule

The scramble for colonies in Africa among European countries reached fever pitch in 1884, when the Berlin Conference was convened to partition Africa amongst European colonial rivals. Among British acquisitions was the land we today call Kenya. A British trading company, Imperial British East Africa Company, was set up and posted to administer Kenya under the name British East Africa Protectorate. When it was realized that the company could not contain Kenya’s hostile communities the British declared the country a colony and Protectorate on 1st July 1895 and posted the first Governor, Sir Arthur Hardinge, to establish a formal British administration.

The seventy years of colonial rule in Kenya were characterized by punitive economic, social and political policies. Most outstanding among these policies was racial discrimination. Huge fertile land was alienated for white settlement, and harsh labor laws were enacted to force the Africans to work at low wages on settler farms and public works. In addition, African political participation was confined to local government.

It was against this scenario that African protest movements began in earnest from the early 1920s. Several political associations, including the Young Kikuyu Association, East African Association, Young Kavirondo Association, North Kavirondo Central Association and Taita Hills Association, were formed to articulate African grievances against forced labor, low wages, heavy taxation, continuing land alienation, and racial discrimination.

Between 1944 and 1960 African political activity and pressure were intensified. In 1944, the first countrywide nationalist party, Kenya African Union (KAU) was formed. And in the same year the first African, Eliud Mathu, was nominated to the settler dominated Legislative Council. Unhappiness with the slow political and economic change led to the breakdown of law and order in the early 1950s, and in 1952 Governor, Sir Everlyn Baring declared a state of emergency following the outbreak of the Mau Mau rebellion, whose major grievances included land alienations, racial discrimination and lack of political progress.

The state of emergency, however, intensified political resolve for independence, forcing the colonial government to come up with constitutional proposals. Under the Lyttleton constitution of 1954 Africans were allowed to directly elect their representatives to the Legislative Council. The elections were held in 1957, and eight African leaders - Ronald Ngala, Tom Mboya, Daniel arap Moi, Mate, Muimi, Oginga Odinga, Oguda and Muliro, were elected. They stepped up agitation for widened representation and independence. After considerable discussion, it was decided to form a mass organization to mobilize the people for the final assault on colonialism, hence the birth of Kenya African National Union, (KANU). KANU was formed in March 1960, at Kiambu town, and on 11 June 1960, it was registered as a mass political society. But as the objective of freedom became evident, many of the smaller communities feared domination by the larger ethnic groups, and on June 25, 1960 they formed the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU). The first election on a broad electoral register was held in 1961, and was won by KANU. In another election in May 1963, KANU captured 83 of the 124 seats in the House of Representatives and formed the Madaraka Administration on 1st June 1963, and the independence Government on 12th December 1963, under Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. y

Kenyan Independence

The first Government of independent Kenya immediately had to deal with some pressing economic and political problems. The priorities were acceleration of growth, Kenyanisation of the economy and redistribution of incomes. None of this, however, could be achieved without political stability, and it was first felt necessary to neutralize those elements in the country who supported extreme policies and who were undermining, rather than building confidence in the new nation. Thus, Kenya embarked on the road to peace and stability, which has made it possible for the country to realize great strides in development.

The country has had three Presidents since independence. Upon Jomo Kenyatta’s death on 22nd August 1978, Daniel arap Moi took over the leadership. He retired on 30th December 2002 in line with a constitutional Provision which limits the Presidential term to a maximum 10 years of 5 years each. This provision took effect in 1991 following the re-introduction of multipartism. Previously kenya was a single party state.

Mwai Kibaki took over from Moi on 30th December 2002 to become Kenya's third President. Kibaki and his National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) won with a landslide in the December 27 2002 general elections, thus ending KANU's forty year stranglehold.

Kenya has played a leading role in the quest for peace and stability in the turbulent East African region, because of her stability and general neutrality. The country has held regular elections every five years since independence. The last election held in December 2002 and which was largely hailed as peaceful paved the way for a smooth transfer of power.

Update: copy of my pleadings were forwarded to Judge Puglisi’s chambers

Posted on | September 21, 2011 | No Comments

I just talked to the clerk of the court in HI. Initially, on September 16 my code did not work for electronic filing, so I submitted my pleadings via FedEx. The clerk stated, that the pleadings submitted on September 16th by one day delivery, were received only yesterday, they will be docketed today and a copy was already forwarded to judge Puglisi. Hearing is scheduled for

The pleadings in DC case before judge Lamberth were docketed. I asked for 20 days emergency hearing. No date yet.

The pleadings in the state case in HI before judge Nishimura are not due until October the 2nd. The hearing is scheduled for October 12th.

There is no decision from the panel of judges Pregerson, Berzon and Fisher in the 9th circuit yet.

I will be leaving for DC today and will have 5 congressional meetings on Thursday

I will keep you appraised of further developments.

my message as washamericom to the obots and obot moderator scrubbers is... this isn't over... censor all you want... people are going to find out sooner than later... godspeed orly taitz...

 

"Godspeed"? She's been at this shit for almost four years now and it's always the "Same shit, different day (i.e. "I miss-filed this", "I screwed up civil procedure on that.")."

She's so incompetent that she has been sanctioned by Federal Judges. She's an abysmal lawyer. We don't have to "censor" her. Her record of miserable failings stands on its own.

What is she now? 0-100 (seriously). At least she won her case against Phil Berg!

If she was the recipient of "Godspeed" in any form or manner, we wouldn't still be hearing about this stupid shit that you people are obsessed with.

Dude, seriously, save the bandwidth. I'm not buying into your silly birther nonsense. I don't care how many quotes you present from far-right kooks. Obama did what you nuts have been screaming about for years - he released his official long form BC, and just like we all knew (including Obama, I'm sure) would happen - you guys scream forgery. But, yeah sure, go out their and blast your findings. It might help you win some votes for your side. Do it at your local polling place. That'll show 'em.

Quite easy explanation with a little more indepth study. The name Kenya wasn't just pulled out of a hat in the 1960s..........

Quite easy explanation with a little more indepth study. The name Kenya wasn't just pulled out of a hat in the 1960s..........

 

The Country was named after the Mountain, Which translates to "White Mountain", Because of the snow cap.   Bet it pisses Michelle off.

 

Oh, I know. It was also known as the British Protectorate of the Kenyan Colony and the Colony of Kenya, Kenya familiarly.

The reason I even brought it up Here...  orly taitz is making serious progress against corrupt obama ... was that I thought it unusual that Kenya be used in 1961, on Barry's Birth Certificate, as His Dad's Country of Birth, when, I believe it was still referred to as "British East Africa Protectorate", until 1963.

And we refer to the Republic of the United States of America by it's full name all the time......  
Think peoples natural inclination to use the familiar...... Think 1961.... Think American national narcissism...... Think bureaucrat, nurse, doctor filling out the form......  
Do ya think they, he, she, it: 1. would even know? 2. Would even care?
 
 
 
 
Wow!!! You teabag heads must be getting really nervous!! You know the prez is going to show you for the chumps you are!! I am totally convinced of it now that this crazy bitch is starting up with her crap again.

I could not honestly make an assessment. That is why I asked. Still waiting for a Grown Up to respond.     Seriously, I would expect it to be filled out Properly, considering that They would be getting the information from either or both of the Parents. One thing Bureaucrats are good for, if nothing else, is filling out Forms.

Yes. A point that was effectively made about a year ago when this first surfaced. Taitz has surrounded herself with known criminals (committed for forgery and fraud), disbarred attorneys, and other people of ill repute in this venture. It's clear she has tunnel vision. She "knows" the outcome, she just needs to find the evidence to corroborate that. And thus, the tragic comedy continues. Eventually, she will cross the line and be disbarred (not because she has attacked Obama, but because she she has acted in a wholly unethical manner (i.e. advising one of her clients, CPT Connie Rhodes to violate the UCMJ). Until then, we will have to continue to be annoyed by her.

Soon she will have the credentials to be considered for a White House Position. The only thing she is lacking at this point is Street Cred.   Maybe if she blew up a 7/11.  
 
 
She best stay out of Chicago until the Families can work this out.

There are always work-arounds to outsmart these dumb computers.  

I have a MAC, but this should work for Windoze also:
Select all, then copy, then paste into a text document. You can then select the part you want to C&P.

 
Critics claimed this document, too, was forged, based primarily on three arguments:

* The country of Kenya did not exist until 1963.

* The Kapi'olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital was not known by that name until 1978.

* A birth certificate from 1961 would not have listed "African" as a race (rather than "Negro" or "Black").

All of these arguments are erroneous. The country now known as the East African republic of Kenya became a British protectorate referred to as Kenya in 1895, obtained colonial status in 1920, and gained full independence from Britain in 1963. The Kapi'olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital was known by that name between 1931 and 1971 (after which its name was shortened to Kapi'olani Hospital). And although "Negro" was the typical demographic term used for American blacks in the early 1960s, "African" was commonly used for blacks who (like Barack Obama's father) were actually native-born Africans.

"I am not a birther, but...................................."

Some very forward leaning clerk in the former British Colony anticipated that it would be named "Kenya" and did you Obama a solid by putting the country's name on there. Of course, the fact that Lucas Smith (possessor of one of the "Kenyan documents") originally tried to sell it on E-bay and has a long rap sheet is completely immaterial! I mean, we must arrive at our conclusion!

In Smith's case, It ended up burning Taitz due to him being the fraud that he is, he ended up making up lies about her too.

 Kabiza.com provides detailed information on a tourists travels to Africa 

Kabiza: People always wonder what Kabiza stands for. The actual words is Kabissa in Kiswahili and means complete. I am far from complete, but that is the journey I am heading in. When I came back from Africa I wanted to use Kabissa but the name was taken, so I took Kabiza and it stuck and that is why today there is Out of Africa - Too at  Out of Africa - Too  the address of this website. I am kind of glad that I have my own site, initially I was on AOL and put together a rudimentary site and then switched to Talk City. In both cases you had ads and pop-up windows and I wanted to get rid of them, besides the mail at MSN did not always come home to me. The is why we have Kabiza. It is also a town in Rwanda that was a place of atrocities during the genocide of 1994 in that country.

No. But I can understand why you might think that. In this specific case, Snopes gives a short sentence response to the use of the name Kenya. Clearly the answer is much more in-depth. I refer to Snopes often.

It is wise not to bank on the character of President Obama.

However, it is also advisable not to place much stock in anything done by Orly fuckin' Taitz.

She's got a screw loose. She's been cited for her misbehavior. She's even facing disbarment.
 
 
 
i care, along with many others. you are banking on obama's pure character, i am not.

 

I'm banking on the fact that a clear majority of Americans - including Republicans - believe that Obama was born where he says he was. You are banking on your delusional fantasy that anybody outside of your little circle of nuts cares about your ridiculous conspiracy theories.

Liberals in this country are barely liberal when compared to other countries and are actually much closer to fascists on the political spectrum than communists, even though conservatives are closer. Do not let facts stop you though, if you are happy with your delusions.

Ok I've been taking sensitivity training, so I'll say this as civilly and nicely as I can...

Shut the fuck up, moron, blow it out your ass!

Actually, he's exactly right.

What have Obama or Dems done lately that in any way resembles Communism?

And for the most part he's absolutely correct on American liberals still being to the right of most of the rest of the world. In Europe, the "Conservative" parties are comparable to the Democrats here; The liberal parties could aptly be called Socialist in the United States.

You need to change that 15 watt light bulb between your ears. It has burned out as has your ignorant repetitive rhetoric.

Let's go over this again. There are only two groups that control the media. The advertisers and those in the media corporations that approve of advertising. Obama is not included or consulted in those decisions. If you do not understand these principals then you are hopelessly ignorant of how media works.

In an explosive interview by Dr. Laurie Roth on her syndicated West Coast radio show on August 7th, Douglas Hagmann—a respected journalist, director of the Northeast Intelligence Network and longtime private investigator, and Judi McLeod, a prolific journalist and the managing editor of Canada Free Press—the reason for the media blackout about the birth-certificate issue was nothing less than organized Mafia-like dire threats to members of the media issued not only from the heads of major TV and radio stations but also from Federal Communication Commission officials!

According to Hagmann and McLeod, who conducted a nine-month investigation and documented their findings scrupulously, after Obama was elected but before he was inaugurated:
•A major TV talk-show host reported that he was ordered not to raise the birth certificate issue or risk losing his job.
• FCC officials threatened to yank broadcasting licenses, break up conglomerates, and make the enactment of the Fairness Doctrine “look mild” in comparison to other consequences.
•In at least one corporate TV headquarters, memos were circulated to all on-air employees not to mention the birth certificate issue, as well as other specific subjects like Obama’s Illinois lawyer’s license, his college records, etc., under both implied and explicit threats.

Dude, seriously, save the bandwidth. I'm not buying into your silly birther nonsense. I don't care how many quotes you present from far-right kooks. Obama did what you nuts have been screaming about for years - he released his official long form BC, and just like we all knew (including Obama, I'm sure) would happen - you guys scream forgery. But, yeah sure, go out their and blast your findings. It might help you win some votes for your side. Do it at your local polling place. That'll show 'em.

 

So i take it you can't answer the question? Why does it say Kenya on his BC then?
 
 
 
don't forget, she's fighting the corrupt courts and media controlled by obama. obama has a strong grip on people not to talk about eligibility and forgery. obama is using intimidation from the top down.

 

I'm really hoping the truth comes out before the elections, but i doubt it will. Obama and his crew has fought to hide everything for so long that many will never believe it when the truth comes out, they'll still be drinking the Koolaid. I don't think we'll know anything for sure until after the elections. Obama has some pretty big people covering for him, and one lawyer is not going to be able to get the truth out. But eventually it will...and i can't wait to hear the responses from the libs! Of course, they'll never believe it....if they're told something is real by their hero, that's all they'll believe. They have no minds of their own....
 
 
 
don't forget, she's fighting the corrupt courts and media controlled by obama. obama has a strong grip on people not to talk about eligibility and forgery. obama is using intimidation from the top down.

 

And yet he hasn't been able to get an infrastructure bill passed.   He controls minds and newspapers and television stations....but he can't get the kind of bill that has ALWAYS had bipartisan support passed.

Anyway.....

So what do you birthers have to say about the birth announcements in the local newspapers?

 Who Is Behind Quashing the Birth Certificate Issue? 

A exerpt:

In an explosive interview by Dr. Laurie Roth on her syndicated West Coast radio show on August 7th, Douglas Hagmanna respected journalist, director of the Northeast Intelligence Network and longtime private investigator, and Judi McLeod, a prolific journalist and the managing editor of Canada Free Pressthe reason for the media blackout about the birth-certificate issue was nothing less than organized Mafia-like dire threats to members of the media issued not only from the heads of major TV and radio stations but also from Federal Communication Commission officials!

According to Hagmann and McLeod, who conducted a nine-month investigation and documented their findings scrupulously, after Obama was elected but before he was inaugurated:
A major TV talk-show host reported that he was ordered not to raise the birth certificate issue or risk losing his job.
 FCC officials threatened to yank broadcasting licenses, break up conglomerates, and make the enactment of the Fairness Doctrine look mild in comparison to other consequences.
In at least one corporate TV headquarters, memos were circulated to all on-air employees not to mention the birth certificate issue, as well as other specific subjects like Obamas Illinois lawyers license, his college records, etc., under both implied and explicit threats.

 

OK Sport. Let's assume for this discussion that your reference has some credibility. Just look at the "facts" you present. BEFORE he was inaugurated? When exactly do you think Obama took over the office? If you want to blame a president for FCC actions before Obama took office you would have to blame Bush. Any other conclusion is insane. I have no idea why Bush would push the FCC toward THAT goal but perhaps they made some kinda behind closed doors deal. Why would Bush benefit from such an arrangement?

I stand by my previous post. Advertisers and those that accept advertising control what is on television and radio.

Seriously, your claim is that Obama has spent millions of dollars, controls the media, and yet hires the worst forgers in the world to do his birth certificate? Seriously?

 

Because he thinks everyone else is stupid...and alot of them are. It wouldn't matter what he showed us now (because he's lied so much), the right won't believe it, and the left will believe anything he tells them.
 
 
your never gonna be able to stop my man obama.
 
 
I'm surprised that there are still states left that allow Orly Taitz to practice law.

I like how you dodged the fact that your claim about Kenya was wrong.

I didn't dodge anything, i just didn't respond to it. I really don't know if it was right or wrong, i'd just asked you why you didn't respond to the other poster...just seemed like you were dodging the question.

Your very survival astonishes me. How does one with such a gift for delusion know when to cross a street or god for bid operate an automobile.

The fact you can manage to type in itself is a major miracle. When a mind like yours just see's what it wants to see how do you distinguish the letters on your keyboard?
 
 
corrupt?
 
 
Orly Taitz, the last attorney to present her case, has been the subject of considerable criticism of her character by various persons during her four year ordeal stretching back to 2008 when she started down this road with Obama. She drew considerable ire and vitriol from Mr. Jablonski, in his letter to Mr. Kemp requesting the dismissal of the hearing. Her case was developed with credible skill however lacked the polish of an experienced litigator. Though appeared solid in evidentiary value and her presentation of the facts were damning. It was probably for the personal nature of her inquiry of Obama and his credentials which drew such criticism from others along the way and Obamas attorney in particular.

Looks like YOUR Messiah, Oily Taint, may have big problems soon. Several judges are considering sanctions on her for being a vexatious litigant.

And everyone everywhere will be able to vote for Obama, because her silly crap will never gain traction in a court of law.

Poor Oily Taint. Too bad, so sad, Bye-bye.

President Obama is Constitutionally qualified to serve as President of the United States assuming (as I do) that he is a natural born citizen.

In that sense, I agree he is a legitimate President.

I also agree that he sucks at the job.

He OUGHT to be tossed out of Office by the electorate.

It is no longer so apparent to me that he will get defeated, however, I am very sad to say. It's still possible. But it is simply NOT a slam dunk even though it easily should be.

Poor America. We brought this shit down on top of our own heads and it looks like a nearly even odds bet that we will repeat that hideous mistake.
