 
 
My view on immigration
 
 
The UK is on its arse at the moment, with many british nationals unable to find good houses and a good job. But what gets me is the idea that people can immigrate into the country and take the houses and jobs that are reserved for them and the government is putting the immigrants first over the country's own people. My view is to cut back on immigration...
your thoughts?
p.s. I am not being racist or discriminative. I have said it for the record.
 
 
Yes the UK does have an immigration problem, however I don't see much being done about it in the near future. In a few years possibly, for the time being I'm afraid we are going to have to put up with it.
 
 
1) migrants are not overrepresented in social housing so that's bull****
2) you would rather migrants entered the country and were unemployed, on welfare etc? Of course they want jobs reserved  
3) I doubt you are a rastafarian

Nothing racist with what you are saying. Personally i think there are some great things to be had out of immigration. But the amount of immigration we have had to this country in the last few years, has just been stupid, in some twisted logic it has been made out that you asking for strong restrictions of immigration to this country, means that sneakily you are a closet fascist, that wishes to see the deaths of all ethnic minorities. If anything i think the purpose of mass immigration is bloody racist and fascist, importing a large group of foreigners to work long hours for slave profit, and live in some run down slum housing is pretty bad.

yes because all black people think that we should have mass immigration :roll eyes:
take it you don't get out that much.
 
 
The idea that immigrants are stealing the jobs of UK citizens is simply a LIE: They are doing jobs that Brits won't do. Most companies advertise jobs only in the UK for a while before looking to the rest of the EU. There was an example of a factory that was built, and it employed exclusively immigrants. When there was local uproar, the company defended itself, they said they listed the jobs on the market for weeks, and received no applicants, so had to look elsewhere. If you fired all the immigrant workers, native workers WOULD NOT fill the gaps, we would just have less people doing the jobs we don't want to do.

I think you are getting confused with the middle class British people, who won't do those jobs.
 
 
My opinion is probably one followed by most of the population.

The UK is in need of some immigrants and so long as people are willing to work and benefit our society I dont have a problem with a limited number being let in, but there are too many coming in at the moment so I agree with the points system Brown implemented and also the cap Cameron has implemented.

In many cases migrants are just used as low wage slaves (so companies don't have to pay higher wages or invest in things like new equipment). The levels of mass immigration we saw in the UK and the USA in the last decades are all part of their neo-liberal economic agenda. Mass immigration has been very good for the capitalist class and most of the middle class, less so for working class Britons (and has unfortunately coincided with deindustrialisation).
 
 
Firstly, people who immigrate to the UK from other countries (usually from the EU due to free movement of labour laws) do not take council houses, but the majority buy or rent homes privately - in fact, in 2007 (the latest year I have data for) under 5% of council housing went to foreign nationals.

Secondly, the issue about jobs. Jobs aren't reserved for people based on nationality, they are given to people based on merit. If two people are applying for a job, and one is more qualified than the other, the employer will give it to that person, regardless of nationality. Papers such as the Daily Mail always print headlines attacking immigrants "taking jobs", but they do not point out that it is often British employers giving these workers jobs - Firms will employ the labour that will provide them with the best service.

Personally, I think that immigration is infact a good thing. It increases competition amongst labour, meaning that firms will have a wider pool of talent to recruit from, which is better for the economy. Remember, immigrants come, and spend money as well, which means that jobs get created as a result, and of course, they pay taxes. The UK will rely on immigration more on the future, especially as the fertility rate decreases, (it is below the replacement rate in the UK) and so if there was large restrictions on immigrations, the proportion of dependents to workers would be a lot higher, which is worse for everyone.

Granted he said 'reserved for' (which would imply social housing), but do you know what percentage of housing social housing constitutes? The pressure comes in the private market, particularly rental..

Which is why you need a suitably fascist accompanying policy re: getting lazy jazzwads up off their asses and into work

Capitalism?
Firms take these immigrants because they work harder then the natives for work intensive jobs, the majority of whom are more than over qualified and willing to work for minimum wage. As a result it makes sense to have them in this economy as it is Capitalism otherwise this country would become less competitive, look at the manufacturing industry over the last few decades.

If immigrants come here for work and don't take the natives council housing,I think it's ok or don't do anything dodgy and help the economy to grow.

To a degree this is true. Companies often exploit the fact that migrants will work in less favorable conditions, and for lower wages (increasing their own profits). The Wall Street Journal constantly calls for unrestricted immigration. Perhaps in theory it is possible that the US capitalist class's chief mouthpiece has misread the bottom line, and that unrestricted immigration is bad for capitalism and good for the working class, but is it likely? The laws of supply and demand inevitably imply that an increase in the supply of workers lowers wages and decreases inflationary pressures. Britain's low wage rates are partly due to high immigration flows, which is why immigrant labour is popular with employers
 
 
 
yes because all black people think that we should have mass immigration :roll eyes:
take it you don't get out that much.

 

If you think rastafari is representative of all black people then you're the one who doesn't get out much, little mate. My point was that repatriation is a large part of rastafari so I don't see why he would concern himself with the country's 'own people' since the basis of rastafari is the idea of back to Africa.
 
 
As more people are immigrating here and leaving us as we are; with less jobs and worse circumstances, it is not their fault. However, (not meant in a racist way) they should stay in their countries until we are in a suitable state for more people to come in. I do understand that immigrants with educational and work basis are welcome but as i said we are not in a state to bring more people in.

Problem is, is that by cutting back on immigration we'd have to renegotiate our entire EU memebrship (and let's be honest, most of the immigration right now is from Europe).

I agree that the rate of immigration is too fast, but I think a lack of jobs and British culture of 'not wanting to do that job' etc are the root causes of the problem. British people could go out and start up car washing companies if they wanted!

people who come to the UK come to work...... why get rid of them..? they contribute to tax. as far as im concerned they pay their tax and help the economy grow they can have any job or house they want.

3) I doubt you are a rastafarian

 

number 2 - not all of them unemployed (i never said that), but cut back the jobs available to immigrants (followed by number of immigrants permitted into the country) and number 3 is irrelevant, just something that makes up a cluster of 3 which is a persuasive technique, so really you only have 2 points.

In the UK, surely all employers are legally obliged to pay any foreign workers minimum wage, and therefore wages cannot drop below that minimum wage, so immigrants and UK citizens competing for a minimum wage job are competing on the basis of merit.

what about british nationals who want to work... they could have them jobs instead i suppose, pay tax and so forth...
 
 
Jobs are still available in this country just go to the job centre and search for cleaning and see how many hits you get. The harsh reality is that british citizens don't want these jobs and would rather sit on their ass all-day on benefits complaining about how the 'foreigners are taking their jobs'. If some people were serious about getting a job then they would get one easy.

Agreed. If people from 2nd/3rd world countries with poor healthcare/education and sometimes even lack of sewage facilities can fly over here, go through the immigration process and find a job before you can then clearly they're far more motivated than you are. The jobs in Britain are a lot closer to Brits than they are for people living in Eastern Europe or Asia so why can they get them before you?
 
 
  Being a "British national" doesn't mean you're entitled to a job.
 
 
It's quite obvious that the British nation has been neutered by liberal dogma.

You have to pledge not to be a racist before you can comment on immigration. How pathetic and how sad.
 
 
The problem with immigration could be sorted out very quickly,but it would involve us leaving the EU. Because of the laws needed to stop it. While we are a member of the EU, nothing will change. It will just be big talk from politicians and nothing else.

There is nothing racist about being anti immigration,I do not blame immigrants for coming to this country seeking a better life, I do not even resent economic migrants, I put the blame firmly with our political classes of all parties. And come the revolution,it will be them who will be persecuted and live in terror,NOT the immigrants.

What exactly is the problem with immigration?
 
 
Everyone here seems to be so enthralled in the cult of diversity and political correctness that they feel the need to exclaim they're not racist before commenting. What a sad indictment of our country; I find it appalling that those who have educated you have inculcated sulphurous ideas of such magnitude that honest discussions on subjects as important as immigration seems impossible.

My view on immigration is as it has been for many, many years: immigration is harmful to any host nation, especially when the arrivals cannot be assimilated with cultural ease.

Deport all immigrants who are on benefits/committed a crime worthy of a custodial sentence - keep all the hard-working, law-abiding immigrants.

/immigration problem
 
 
I'm sure that the only reason why the immigrants take "your" job is because they are better at it, and more prepared.

Nothing is reserved for immigrants, and I'm pretty sure it takes a long time to get a house over here.
What stops you from migrating to Switzerland, Norway, The Netherlands? They are in EU, they have better living standards and hey, the Dutch and Swiss can move over here so you can do the same.

Furthermore, unemployment in the countries from which immigrants come is much worse than here at the UK.

Finally, no job is reserved for immigrants, they work hard for it... 10 minutes ago I had to help a British guy to explain what a cover letter is, oh, and yes I am foreign.

These immigrants surely are better at picking strawberries & wiping tables, aren't they...

Immigration in this country is sullied because the constituent migrants are unskilled / semi-skilled; the labour they gravitate towards has a depressing effect on the money / nominal wage of those types of occupation: a working class man who is perhaps unskilled would find the natural cost of his labour decrease in the face of an increased supply in the labour market.

Sure... well the fact that you stereotyped that all Rastafarians wouldn't oppose mass immigration, suggest that you make another blatant generalisation that you won't find a black man who opposes mass immigration. You could twist all religions and sects within that religion to favour a political view, just look at the new testament and old testament for example, let alone islam, or buddhism, thats when it gets really complicated !
 
 
What i don't understand about these debate on immigration, is that there is very little balance and midway point. People are either saying "deport all immigrants back" or the people on the other side, fail to recognise the point "mass immigration" and convince themselves you are arguing about abolishing all worldwide immigration, because there is no sensible argument proposing mass immigration to continue in a country such as the U.K
 
 
I think there should be a temporary ban until the U.K recovers. One thing I approve of immigrants (my parents are ex-immigrants) is that they do take up lower quality housing and try and make it their home e.g. residents in Newham. I think illegal immigration should be punished but if they apply to live in the U.K and stay law abiding, I'm happy.

I do tend to base my opinion around my parents. But knowing that my parents don't claim benefits, I'm not as severe as the OP. But knowing that my parents and quite a few in my community have learnt very little of the language, it influences my opinion.

I think the government should reduce student visas (there's quite a lot outstaying their visa) and also should make a scheme where undergraduates are encouraged to teach some people English for a financial reward e.g. university related.

Why the negs?

Please tell me where I am wrong.
 
 
As far as EU nationals are concerned they have the absolute right to work, live and earn in this land as much as any Brit has in France, Germany and other EU states. To be of the opinion that immigrants get it easy is wrong, they don't. If is extremely hard for migrants from all across the globe to make a living in the UK and sometimes getting a job can be incredibly hard. How would you like it if Poland and Britain swapped places and we were migrating to Poland, we would expect rights and a job. To remain ignorant of our neighbours and hold an archaic view of 'Brits for Britain' is pointless and is not a view in touch with the times. We are a global nation and a global nation we will remain not one that shuts people out.

A rastafarian wouldn't care about immigration because a rastafarian wouldn't see themselves as one of Britain's 'own people', rastafari is the belief that black people in the West were stolen from Africa and that's their national identity and ultimately where they want to return. That is not reading something extra into rastafari, it is the basis of the religion. Rastafari is itself named after Ras Tafari, or Haile Selasie I, the king of Ethiopia. If a rastafarian did, for some reason, care about immigration, I struggle to see why they would choose the side of Britons, since when rastafari speaks of Babylon it refers to the white establishment and imperialism. Plus why would generalising rastafarians, which I'm not doing anyway, suggest I would generalise black people? Rastafari is a tiny minority religion even in Jamaica, it's like saying generalising the Zoroastrians would suggest I don't like Iranians. On a level you're out of your depth chatting **** to me about this, you sound like a speng.

I don't both emoting on the travails of the individual migrant - people get themselves into a rut by romanticising the exploits of migrants to such an extent that they lose all sense of proportion and objectivity. Here's the story of the poor ol' Chinaman and his journey into England to work - by reducing the question of immigration to a bunch of emotive diatribes it can be very easy to lose sight of immigration as a depersonalised concept.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: immigration is of little to no benefit to the host nation; the idea that immigration is a necessity for economic prosperity is a pernicious lie. The overriding factor of all this is fertility; the immigrationist will substantiate his view by pointing to declining fertility, this is the only substantial argument for immigration, but I would submit that this is a deficiency within the State that needs to be remedied within the State.
 
 
For the record, I am a British nationalist, so to those who are making a biggie about the rastafarian issue... you've been told.
 
 
 
yes because all black people think that we should have mass immigration :roll eyes:
take it you don't get out that much.

 

Yes because all Rastafarian's have to be black. Do you get out much?
 
 
the government should stop all immigration from outside Europe for five years; that way we could deal with the 800,000 illegal immigrants still here and the enormous backlog of asylum applications. We could then put in place a fair, but strong system that deals with immigration. But no government has the balls to do anything like that
 
 
If the native people are not able to find jobs then whose fault is it?

The companies have to pay the same salary to an employee irrespective of his/her nationality. So if a Chinese person gets employed instead of an English person then why put the blame on the Immigrant.

Now, lots of emigration is happening from the UK to developing nations, so how would they feel if the countries they want to work in are all hostile to them?
 
 
Nothing wrong with immigration per se but the British approach has some serious mental health issues.

Canada has it right - as does Australia. If you can't make the point score (taking into account factors such as age, linguistic skills, education, finances, professional skills etc), show you are healthy and not a criminal you don't get in. This ensures that Canada and Australia get a controlled immigration flow of people who can actually contribute to their new countries rather than people who will be nothing but a burden on the state.
 
 
We need more immigrants to account for the declining/ageing population. The ONS predicts that by 2050 1 in 4 Britons will be pensioners, I don't think you understand the true implications of this.

That and if they have British citizenship I strongly doubt they'd be given priority based on their ethnicity for a housing placement or whatever? Are you really that paranoid -_-?

I just find this argument so idiotic on so many levels lol.

EMZ.

The government and private companies should be blamed for allowing jobs to go abroad, however, if all countries had open immigration policies the first world countries will be unable to function, and the poor countries will just keep getting more populated because they don't use condoms.

Getting into Britain as a non-EU migrant is extremely difficult. You have to jump through all sorts of hurdles beforehand (language test, points system etc.) and even when you do arrive in the country you have no recourse to public funds meaning you're ineligible for benefits. Of course there's some provisions made for asylum seekers but that's because they're not allowed to work.

This is asinine.

First of all, the idea behind the need for immigrants is based on them all going out to work and paying taxes. This is all very well but there needs to be jobs for them to work in and the UK is hardly the job creating capital of the world. It's not a question of import a lot of labor and suddenly social security worries disolve as a result in a surge of employment opportunities and generated tax revenue.

Secondly, don't immigrants get old too? Assuming they do then logically your answer to Britain's ageing population problem would be perpetual mass immigration chasing a perpetually ageing population - a bit like a dog chasing it's tail.

No doubt. I am sure that there are a lot more hurdles for an Australian doctor than for a Hungarian Roma. That's my point really.

You are the reason why companies want to hire immigrants.

Sitting on a computer and writing filthy stuff is easy.

You are just getting personal and distasteful about things. If you have nothing intelligent to say, just read what others have written and maybe increase your knowledge.

It's a short-term solution and yes it's idiotic, but if your priority's to keep this bs going then there's going to need to be a rising population so that the pensioner:labourer ratio is sufficient.

Personally I think we should invest our resources into efficiently initiating a painless and effective mass extinction since it's an inevitability anyway and overpopulation spiralling out of control, and there's never going to be world peace, etc. etc. but no one wants that so yes, getting immigrants to work is a lousy short-term solution.

 http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2...lumandrefugees 

 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2053581.stm 

blah blah I don't need to support this argument. I'm just sick of people whining about immigration and over-population since it's trivial in relation to the fundamental problem.

Again with the jobs it's just all a mess and there is no single solution just a load of clumsy short-term fixes which lead to more problems in the future, but as I said, no one is going to agree with me on the extinction so yeah.

Exactly.

The global population is getting older. Population growth has collapsed in most of the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa, and even there it's falling.

The fundamental shift in manual/crappy labour isn't going to come from just importing unskilled people by the barrelful, because that just creates a problem for the generation after them who have to support an artificially large generation that has been boosted by immigration. We should be heavily investing in robotics and automation to pick up the slack in the workforce. We are on the verge of another technological revolution right now, with serious and rapid progress being made in robotics. It's a matter of years before we start to have robotic labourers to fill a vacant demographic in society.

Don't a lot of the immigrant workers leave anyway for retirement back to their country of origin once they've made enough money? The demographics in Europe will be a problem for future generations as they have to support a huge retired/elderly population as well as their own children if they have any. I think the only long term solution is for people to pay for their own retirement (age 70+), encourage elderly people to move in with their adult children as happens with other cultures (Italy, Asia, Latin America) which will free up space as you won't have 1 elderly woman to a house and care homes will become less popular. Longer visas which allow immigrants to work here for ten years (renewable) and then leave after they reach their 40s/50s is also an option as it'd expand the working age population without resulting in a large elderly population.

European workers do because Poland, Lithuania, etc. are now pretty free and prosperous, and easy to re-enter due to the EU.

But most non-EU immigrants are here to stay. Many come from places like the Congo and southern Somalia - why would you want to go back!?

Well, I'll kind of believe that when I see it. The construction industry was talking about bricklaying robots 25 years ago but I havn't seen any yet!

Is robotics really the answer though? Surely that would serve only to increase unemployment and further reduce the tax base?

Like any policy, immigration has its pros and cons. Its the balance between them that determines whether its a good or bad policy. Immigration has brought massive benefits to the UK, increase in skilled workers just to name one. Now you can't just turn your back on immigrants when its convenient for you. The UK would be not as developed if immigrants turned their backs when it UK needed them.
 
 
Agreed - unemployment is sky high. Adding more people to the country is insane.
 
 
 
A rastafarian wouldn't care about immigration because a rastafarian wouldn't see themselves as one of Britain's 'own people', rastafari is the belief that black people in the West were stolen from Africa and that's their national identity and ultimately where they want to return. That is not reading something extra into rastafari, it is the basis of the religion. Rastafari is itself named after Ras Tafari, or Haile Selasie I, the king of Ethiopia. If a rastafarian did, for some reason, care about immigration, I struggle to see why they would choose the side of Britons, since when rastafari speaks of Babylon it refers to the white establishment and imperialism. Plus why would generalising rastafarians, which I'm not doing anyway, suggest I would generalise black people? Rastafari is a tiny minority religion even in Jamaica, it's like saying generalising the Zoroastrians would suggest I don't like Iranians. On a level you're out of your depth chatting **** to me about this, you sound like a speng.

 

You are diverting attention away from the main topic, with your wikipedia knowledge, i will not entertain your fantasies any longer.
 
 
 
You are the reason why companies want to hire immigrants.

Sitting on a computer and writing filthy stuff is easy.

You are just getting personal and distasteful about things. If you have nothing intelligent to say, just read what others have written and maybe increase your knowledge.

 

Everything I said was correct third world countries have an extremely fast growing population and if we had open immigration all our government funded education, healthcare etc would be unsustainable.

Then again, a point of democracy, is that people should be able to vote on big changes, passing through of legislation, all those years back, at the start of the century, people should have been allowed to vote for or against the mass movement of migrants into this country.

Not everyone has benefited from mass immigration, infact only the wealthy and ultra rich have. It hasn't helped the working classes at all in terms of job competition, and achieving a decent paying wage. The financial elite, created this whole idea and fable, that Mass immigration will bring about multiculturalism, and a more progressive world, to disguise the fact, that they want to make profit out of cheap slave like workers. having travelled to different parts of the world, its laughable the image the u.k government has created of the country, as having the streets paved of gold and opportunities. Of course a lot of migrants who end up coming here, end up disappointed, and just get added to the growing number of jobless people.

Robots still need to be maintained, companies need to be around to manufacture them, or at least to manufacture the robots that manufacture the other robots! Then to service them, market them, export them, transport them... it's a whole new economy.

I agree. I don't think that ordinary working class people have benefited much from mass immigration.

But most non-EU immigrants are here to stay. Many come from places like the Congo and southern Somalia - why would you want to go back!?

 

The ones who come from South Asia and the Caribbean tend to be able to afford villa-style gated properties after working here for a decade or so. A lot of the South Asian and Caribbean labourers who came here in the 50s have returned to a far more comfortable life and been able to retire before they turned 50. Long term work visas coupled with a reduction in entry requirements for such immigrants (but with better tracking systems for such people) would be a good step towards solving the demographic problem. They'd expand the working age population and grow old in the sunny part of the world where they grew up and have nostalgic feelings towards.

 
Not sure what your parents are like but I don't want my old man living with me -belching and farting all over the place. It'd be like living with Albert Steptoe.

 

Aha yes but usually you end up with widows on their own as men tend to die earlier and it's a bit of a waste to have one woman living on her own in a house which was bought for a family of 4. If you're willing to pay for private care homes then that's fine as well but I don't think it's viable to have subsidised ones.
 
 
 
Robots still need to be maintained, companies need to be around to manufacture them, or at least to manufacture the robots that manufacture the other robots! Then to service them, market them, export them, transport them... it's a whole new economy.

 

Yes, but this benefits educated and middle class people.

This has happened in the American manufacturing industry. The United States is the largest manufacturer in the world, and it's output in almost every sector has increased at quite staggering rates, decade-upon-decade. Yet, huge numbers of people in blue-collar jobs have lost employment because production is becoming increasingly mechanized to maintain competitiveness and increase profitability. The robots are designed in places like California, or Cambridge, MA - yet the people in rural Pennsylvania or Ohio are not part of this enterprise. A similar thing has happened all over the West - in your country the city of Sheffield has historically produced Steel. Steel output is higher than it ever has been - however the process is so mechanized that the local workforce has been laid off. The machines used are American designed and manufactured. How has that helped the working classes of Sheffield?
 
 
 
Getting into Britain as a non-EU migrant is extremely difficult. You have to jump through all sorts of hurdles beforehand (language test, points system etc.) and even when you do arrive in the country you have no recourse to public funds meaning you're ineligible for benefits. Of course there's some provisions made for asylum seekers but that's because they're not allowed to work.

 

All you need to do is arrive here by student visa/sea container/swim, claim asylum and scream human rights if declined.
 
 
 
The UK is on its arse at the moment, with many british nationals unable to find good houses and a good job. But what gets me is the idea that people can immigrate into the country and take the houses and jobs that are reserved for them and the government is putting the immigrants first over the country's own people. My view is to cut back on immigration...

You are diverting attention away from the main topic, with your wikipedia knowledge, i will not entertain your fantasies any longer.

 

You're the one who diverted, little mate. Protip: next time you gonna speak up you might want to make it something you actually know about
 
 
 
Firstly, people who immigrate to the UK from other countries (usually from the EU due to free movement of labour laws) do not take council houses, but the majority buy or rent homes privately - in fact, in 2007 (the latest year I have data for) under 5% of council housing went to foreign nationals.
Maybe you're missing the salient point that houses which people from the UK could take, or rent privately are being taken still, it doesn't matter whether they're council houses or not, that's just irrelavant.
Secondly, the issue about jobs. Jobs aren't reserved for people based on nationality, they are given to people based on merit. If two people are applying for a job, and one is more qualified than the other, the employer will give it to that person, regardless of nationality. Papers such as the Daily Mail always print headlines attacking immigrants "taking jobs", but they do not point out that it is often British employers giving these workers jobs - Firms will employ the labour that will provide them with the best service.
I'd ask for a source for this, but there's no point becausei know you don't have one. Firstly, your point regarding employers giving jobs to people based on merit is just an idealised version of the working world because from what i've personally witnessed and known about, some employers will prey on the naivety and higher economic ignorance with regards to our £ of immigrants and will give them a job because they will accept a lower wage. Obviously, they don't decrease the stated salary if an immigrant applies but i've known of cases where employers have advertised jobs in areas with a high amount of immigrants (such as my area) and they will generally offer lower wages than other employers in different areas where people recognise that the wages being offered aren't worth their graft.
Personally, I think that immigration is infact a good thing. It increases competition amongst labour, meaning that firms will have a wider pool of talent to recruit from, which is better for the economy. Remember, immigrants come, and spend money as well, which means that jobs get created as a result, and of course, they pay taxes. The UK will rely on immigration more on the future, especially as the fertility rate decreases, (it is below the replacement rate in the UK) and so if there was large restrictions on immigrations, the proportion of dependents to workers would be a lot higher, which is worse for everyone.

 

I think an important question to ask is, do the majority of immigrants take jobs which any 18 year old with half a functioning brain couldn't do? A lot of them become bus drivers, work in shops etc and so when you say there is a 'wider pool of talent', i think it's just a general and common thing you say which is bordering on hyperbole, because there's rarely a job that an immigrant does which a British person couldn't do.

Now, from this you might think i'm against immigration but to be honest i'm really not, some of my family from generations back were immigrants and if Britain hadn't been so kid as to let them stay on her shores, i might have been born in a village where the kids tote guns and the adults encourage it. But some of your points were just often repeated and vague statements which aren't true and just annoy me.

Because by making it an issue of race, they can bury their heads in the sand and pretend the problem doesn't exist. It's nothing to do with race, it's sheer numbers of people putting too much strain on public services.

Yes I agree with this but it was the British government's responsiblity of having some sort vote on this. They should have outlined very clearly all the pros and cons of mass immigration and then allowed people to make a sound and informed choice on this matter.

What percentage of our immigrants are asylum seekers?
 
 
Immigration is a hugely beneficial thing for the UK economy - it not only depresses wages and inflation, but it provides workers for low-paid jobs that a lot of traditional Brits would rather not do. They certainly do not receive priority for any type of benefit; however there are some shocking cases whereby asylum seeking nationals have been provided with a home that set backs the taxpayer unfathomable sums. The problem there is not the immigration itself, its the system and bureaucracy.

It's pathetically small to be honest, considering immigration is in the hundreds of thousands.

 
In 2010 the leading sources of asylum applicants in the UK were Iran, Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

The old mantra that migrants 'do the jobs that Britons don't want to do' is antiquated, is platitudinous and is emphatically wrong. Anybody will do anything so long as the reward is there.

And god only knows why you think depressed wages is a benefit; the consequence of mass immigration as an ameliorating effect on inflation is also incredibly dubious to say the least.

what wrongs with you moody poo?
 
 
 
Maybe you're missing the salient point that houses which people from the UK could take, or rent privately are being taken still, it doesn't matter whether they're council houses or not, that's just irrelavant. Firstly, I was replying to the OP who, from what was written, seemed to imply that UK citizens are entitled to housing, and that immigrants are taking these houses away from entitled UK citizens. It is a physical law of the universe that when you increase one variable (people) and keep another constant (housing), then there will be less of the second variable per unit of the first variable.

I'd ask for a source for this, but there's no point becausei know you don't have one. Firstly, your point regarding employers giving jobs to people based on merit is just an idealised version of the working world because from what i've personally witnessed and known about, some employers will prey on the naivety and higher economic ignorance with regards to our £ of immigrants and will give them a job because they will accept a lower wage.

If immigrants are willing to work for longer hours for the same amount of money, then that makes them more worthwhile to employ. The fact that they are willing to work more for less is a merit.

I think an important question to ask is, do the majority of immigrants take jobs which any 18 year old with half a functioning brain couldn't do? A lot of them become bus drivers, work in shops etc and so when you say there is a 'wider pool of talent', i think it's just a general and common thing you say which is bordering on hyperbole, because there's rarely a job that an immigrant does which a British person couldn't do. No, but it means that there is more competition for those jobs, meaning that to get those jobs, people will have to up their skills and be willing to work longer hours for less to get those jobs. I never said that thanks to immigration, we can now do things we couldn't before, because that would be untrue, it simply means that employers have more choice from available workers.

Now, from this you might think i'm against immigration but to be honest i'm really not, some of my family from generations back were immigrants and if Britain hadn't been so kid as to let them stay on her shores, i might have been born in a village where the kids tote guns and the adults encourage it. But some of your points were just often repeated and vague statements which aren't true and just annoy me. You being related to immigrants isn't a reason to convince me that you are against immigration -current Immigrants themselves have the most to lose from further immigration, as they will have further competition in the labour market.

 

I'm sorry I can't be more accurate on an internet forum, and as a result I may sometimes have to be vague. The UK's immigration policy may not be perfect, but I really dislike the way that a lot of the media (Daily Mail, Express) attack immigrants for trying to better their lot, and immigration as a whole, and that all this does is breed hatred - (I.e when you see headlines along the lines of "Foreigners taking our jobs") as if British people are entitled to a job, without putting in any work at all.

I'm an "ethnic minority" and I agree with you so don't worry about being called a racist. It makes sense. One thing that amazes me is the idea that the government thinks it's going to cut down immigration in large amounts by capping immigration outside of Europe. Europe is one of the reason why immigration has spiked over the last couple of years.

And god only knows why you think depressed wages is a benefit; the consequence of mass immigration as an ameliorating effect on inflation is also incredibly dubious to say the least.

 

If you were right... then why is that whatever coffee shop/restaurant, or in fact any retail store, you find Eastern Europeans doing the jobs there?? Do you think the employer prefers customer service that struggles to speak fluent English?? Or do you think no English applied for the job because the majority of individuals claiming job seekers allowance are lazy bastards who don't want to work for a decent and honorable wage..?

Say what you see - aren't you supposed to be a student? Yours is a very facile comment.

Mass immigration depresses the nominal wage of the sort of labour you describe, accordingly, unskilled labourers would calculate for greater financial reward from State handouts rather than work; that depressed money / nominal wage is only a factor because of the presence of the migrants themselves. If you're trying to posture an argument that follows the line that immigrants are necessary so we can have our fair share of kebab shops and waiters then you really are scrapping the bucket. In some towns there's nearly a third of young people out of work: that's a structural deficit that isn't remedied by importing a load of third world peasants.

The problem is that there are jobs out there - the technically 'unemployed' (who are supposedly seeking work) are not prepared to do any of them. If you're suggesting there is a surplus of the supply of labour in the retail industry for low-paid jobs (whereby the unemployed are genuinely prepared to work) then you are certainly wrong. There are jobs out there if you look for them; but many people are complacent in their unemployed situation and feel if they do actually seek work, that work must be well paid - not minimum wage in a coffee shop which many immigrants would happily work for; they're doing the jobs that the lazy British would consider themselves to 'skilled' or 'capable' to do. Immigration is a huge benefit to the economy; you must remember jobs are prioritized to British workers simply because discrimination does take place; yet the immigrants still get all the low-paid jobs. Ask yourself why. To me, its obvious..

I don't have the intellectual strength to have this argument because youngsters / children of your ilk peddle the same old mythology. You say brazenly that 'immigration is a huge benefit' but students of your calibre don't bother to fathom whether that's true of your own accord: you just repeat verbatim what others have taught you. I'll say it again: immigration is of no benefit whatsoever; the economic consequences - especially for unskilled / low skilled labour - & social consequences are enormous.

There is no such thing as a 'surplus' in the labour market: nominal wages for unskilled labour are privy to supply & demand, when supply exceeds demand the money / nominal wage falls; the idea that immigration is a necessity to accommodate unskilled occupations is pure fantasy: in the absence of migrants the nominal wage for that sort of labour would increase, i.e., the reward would increase pursuant to increase demand, hence there would be greater facility within the State's labour market to provide work for those jobs you describe. You don't understand economics as a system of reward, hence you can so easily blurt out the garbage that Britons are 'lazy'.

I'm sorry - but what about Spain?! Greece?! These places are far more 'on their arse'!!! Youth unemployment in Spain is nearly 40%. In Greece it is around the 50% region.
 
 
 
I'm sure that the only reason why the immigrants take "your" job is because they are better at it, and more prepared.

Nothing is reserved for immigrants, and I'm pretty sure it takes a long time to get a house over here.
What stops you from migrating to Switzerland, Norway, The Netherlands? They are in EU, they have better living standards and hey, the Dutch and Swiss can move over here so you can do the same.

Furthermore, unemployment in the countries from which immigrants come is much worse than here at the UK.

Finally, no job is reserved for immigrants, they work hard for it... 10 minutes ago I had to help a British guy to explain what a cover letter is, oh, and yes I am foreign.

 

You can't just walk into those two nations (legally) as a UK citizen.
 
 
 
Aha yes but usually you end up with widows on their own as men tend to die earlier and it's a bit of a waste to have one woman living on her own in a house which was bought for a family of 4. If you're willing to pay for private care homes then that's fine as well but I don't think it's viable to have subsidised ones.

 

Well, I don't really know where my mum is. I think she lives in Greece somewhere so she won't be in the picture. But the thought of "Father Jack meets Albert Steptoe" living with me for 20 years doesn't fill me with joy!

Yes but they've got nice weather.

But what do you expect the significant chunk of youth who are unemployed in these nations to do? If they just stay put they do not really maximise their chances of acquiring gainful employment?

Alternatively if they go online and apply to some positions in northern Europe and line up a nice job in France/the UK/Belgie/Nederland/Deutschland/Sverige then that will be better for their income and career and will also mean they are no loner dependent on the Spanish/Greek welfare state.

Likewise, when I could only find a job in Nederland I decided to migrate there for work - since the alternative was to be unemployed in England, which would not make sense.

Do you speak English in your Dutch job? Can you speak Dutch?

And you're trying to apportion blame for a multi faceted problem on one section of society and wanting to punish them for it. There is one reason why people are employed in posts, because they're the best person for the job. No one is stealing British jobs, are you butthurt because you got overlooked for a job recently or something?
 
 
 
Firstly, people who immigrate to the UK from other countries (usually from the EU due to free movement of labour laws) do not take council houses, but the majority buy or rent homes privately - in fact, in 2007 (the latest year I have data for) under 5% of council housing went to foreign nationals.

Secondly, the issue about jobs. Jobs aren't reserved for people based on nationality, they are given to people based on merit. If two people are applying for a job, and one is more qualified than the other, the employer will give it to that person, regardless of nationality. Papers such as the Daily Mail always print headlines attacking immigrants "taking jobs", but they do not point out that it is often British employers giving these workers jobs - Firms will employ the labour that will provide them with the best service.

 

Not necessarily. They are also given to people based on how low the employer can pay them.

 
Personally, I think that immigration is infact a good thing. It increases competition amongst labour, meaning that firms will have a wider pool of talent to recruit from, which is better for the economy. Remember, immigrants come, and spend money as well, which means that jobs get created as a result, and of course, they pay taxes. The UK will rely on immigration more on the future, especially as the fertility rate decreases, (it is below the replacement rate in the UK) and so if there was large restrictions on immigrations, the proportion of dependents to workers would be a lot higher, which is worse for everyone.
 

Why is opening up an already saturated job market to unbridled foreign competition good for the economy? How is that good for the working class who are being undercut by cheap foreign labour? And your solution to our demographic problem is to... import a new populace? How do you think that is going to work out when in fifty years time the population has gone from majority white, European, culturally British/Christian, to non-white, Asian and mostly Islamic?

There is zero evidence that immigration benefits the economy, and it is likely to actually harm the lowest strata of society. Furthermore, and more seriously, immigration profoundly disrupts and undermines the cultural cohesiveness of the nation - as we have already learned from importing masses of inhabitants from the Indian subcontinent.

It should be obvious to everyone by now that we do have an immigration problem, we don't need immigration at all, and that we ought to cut back completely. Even the argument for importing 'skilled labour' is economically and morally illiterate, seeing as we should be able to produce our own skilled workers, and that we are doing developing nations a terrible disservice by, in effect, stealing their most able individuals.

Shame that the whole debate surrounding immigration has been warped by this noxious Leftist intellectual psychedelic which cannot think in any other terms but 'immigration must be good because to say otherwise is evil and racist'.

Do you actually know any Germans?

The #1 complaint from them (OK...maybe #2 complaint behind the Euro crisis) is that there are too many Turks in their country causing problems.

The VAST majority of people do not want mass immigration, weak chinned liberal!

They are not good for this country. END OF STORY.

Every country complains about immigrants, Germany has 3x the number of Poles compared to the UK yet their economy is by far the best in Europe. How comes Britain can't do the same?

Different economies.

It's quite evident that immigration is no longer benefiting us. Time to close the gates and pray that Turkey doesn't join the EU.
 
 
Don't care tbh. There was a docu on BBC3 recently saying on average (if I correctly remember) 3 bus loads of Poles arrive to the UK every day. Welcome, I say.

And after watching this:

I live in quite a rural area, and there are many Eastern European immigrants employed as farmhands (including my sisters friends parents)- tell me, how many British people would fancy working through the winter, in the dark of the early morning, in frozen fields for minimum wage?
 
 
 
The idea that immigrants are stealing the jobs of UK citizens is simply a LIE: They are doing jobs that Brits won't do. Most companies advertise jobs only in the UK for a while before looking to the rest of the EU. There was an example of a factory that was built, and it employed exclusively immigrants. When there was local uproar, the company defended itself, they said they listed the jobs on the market for weeks, and received no applicants, so had to look elsewhere. If you fired all the immigrant workers, native workers WOULD NOT fill the gaps, we would just have less people doing the jobs we don't want to do.

 

Completely right, I see chavs and other low lives moaning on the streets about no job when they don't even make an effort trying to get a job. Alot of people in my secondary school complained about immigration and such, and most of them students came out with really bad results. I can see them complaining in 10 years time when they have no job because they just didn't try hard enough at school, and to make themselves feel less guilty they blame the immigrants.

So Britain not manufacturing things is the fault of immigrants? Anyway I suggest you read  this . Britain's manufacturing industry is a bigger part of our economy than it is to the US, also Britain is the 6th biggest exporter of manufactured goods.

"Anna's travelling on one of the 20 buses taking Polish immigrants to Britain every day".
 
 
Not all immigrants (illegal and legal) are necessarily detrimental to our society. Of course, I may be biased as most of my elder relatives including my parents are immigrants - but they have paid their fair share of taxes to the government. I do not think that immigrants should be blamed for lack of employment opportunities, but rather the employer should be blamed because they have the responsibility of hiring people. It would be surprising if they didn't know they had employed an (illegal) immigrant.

I am aware that there are some drawbacks (ie. illegal immigrants may put some strain on the healthcare system). But it is my view that immigrants have significantly contributed to the society we know and live in today.
 
 
 
The UK is on its arse at the moment, with many british nationals unable to find good houses and a good job. But what gets me is the idea that people can immigrate into the country and take the houses and jobs that are reserved for them and the government is putting the immigrants first over the country's own people. My view is to cut back on immigration...
your thoughts?
p.s. I am not being racist or discriminative. I have said it for the record.

 

Your idea... taking houses and taking jobs..is that..an idea..not a fact. Take a good look at the statistics and do some research your comments show your ignorance around the subject. When did this country ever put "its people" first anyway.. jeeez..I despair at the lack of insight!!

as the other posts say, the stuff about housing is crap

I do believe that there should be standards with who we let in, as a lot of EU residents have pretty bad criminal records and cant speak a word of english which is disgraceful, in my opinion.

Epic post.

It won't get through though, any sensible rational debate on immigration policy is overcome by those who are led by their emotions rather than their brains; who have no understanding of how the job market works, or the economy, an overly simplistic view on culture and nationhood, and have been indoctrinated into stifling any talk on the issue by growing up under New Labour.

I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to Economics, but surely immigration helps the economy by creating demand for products and services?

Beefy HoL report, but everything you need to know is in it.

Abstract:

Spoiler:
Immigration has become highly significant to the UK economy: immigrants
comprise 12% of the total workforce—and a much higher proportion in London.
However, we have found no evidence for the argument, made by the Government,
business and many others, that net immigration—immigration minus emigration—
generates significant economic benefits for the existing UK population.

Overall GDP, which the Government has persistently emphasised, is an irrelevant
and misleading criterion for assessing the economic impacts of immigration on the
UK. The total size of an economy is not an index of prosperity. The focus of
analysis should rather be on the effects of immigration on income per head of the
resident population. Both theory and the available empirical evidence indicate that
these effects are small, especially in the long run when the economy fully adjusts to
the increased supply of labour. In the long run, the main economic effect of
immigration is to enlarge the economy, with relatively small costs and benefits for
the incomes of the resident population.

The economic impacts of immigration depend critically on the skills of
immigrants. Different types of immigrant can have very different impacts on the
economy. The issue is not whether immigration is needed but what level and type
of immigration is desirable. In this context, net immigration from the EU—which
we expect to remain positive—cannot be controlled. The question then is whether
additional immigration from elsewhere carries benefits or disadvantages.

Many businesses and public services at present make use of the skills and hard
work of immigrants. But this is not an argument for immigration on a scale which
exceeds emigration and thus increases the population of the country. We do not support the general claims that net immigration is indispensable to fill labour and skills shortages. Such claims are analytically weak and provide insufficient reason for promoting net immigration. Vacancies are, to a certain extent, a sign of a healthy economy. Immigration increases the size of the economy and overall
labour demand, thus creating new vacancies. As a result, immigration is unlikely to
be an effective tool for reducing vacancies other than in the short term.

We also question the Government’s claim that immigration has generated fiscal
benefits. Estimates of the fiscal impacts are critically dependent on who counts as
an immigrant (or as a descendant of an immigrant) and on what items to include
under costs and benefits. The overall fiscal impact of immigration is likely to be
small, though this masks significant variations across different immigrant groups.

Rising population density has potentially important economic consequences for
the resident population, including impacts on housing, as well as wider welfare
effects, especially in parts of England where immigrants are most concentrated.
Although immigration is only one of a number of factors affecting the demand for
housing, it does exert a significant impact on the housing market in particular
areas. Some of the wider impacts from rising population are hard to measure and
highly regional. Some, such as the impact of increasing population density on the
cost and speed of implementation of public infrastructure projects, remain poorly
understood.

Arguments in favour of high immigration to defuse the “pensions time bomb” do
not stand up to scrutiny as they are based on the unreasonable assumption of a
static retirement age as people live longer and ignore the fact that, in time,
immigrants too will grow old and draw pensions. Increasing the retirement age, as
the Government has done, is the only viable approach to resolving this issue.
There are significant unknowns and uncertainties in the existing data on
immigration and immigrants in the UK.

There are insufficient data about people leaving the UK and about short-term immigration to the UK. Existing data do not allow for accurate measurement of the stock of immigrants at national, regional and local levels. Inevitably, even less is known about the scale of illegal immigration and illegal employment of immigrants. The gaps in migration data create significant difficulties for the analysis and public debate of immigration, the conduct of monetary policy, the provision of public services and a wide range of other public policies.

Our overall conclusion is that the economic benefits to the resident population of
net immigration are small, especially in the long run. Of course, many immigrants
make a valuable contribution to the UK. But the real issue is how much net
immigration is desirable. Here non-economic considerations such as impacts on
cultural diversity and social cohesion will be important, but these are outside the
scope of our inquiry.
 
 
Here's my view- they should all **** off back to their own countries. Funny that isnt it?

From my experience most (almost all) is directed at the Turks and how they lack the Teutonic work ethic and how they are weird because they dislike Bratwurst and sunbathing. Poles have been part of the German fabric for centuries, I think there were actually a higher % of Germany in 1901 than 2011. I don't think they are really seen as an issue by Germans. Germans have a mindset where a Turk can never be a German, with German identity still very much based around the Germanic ethnicity - everybody else is just somebody else in Germany (hence why so many of the Turks are still not actual citizens). I spent a fair while in Berlin and beneath the hip city there is a lot of segregation - particularly in the white working class old East Berlin and places like Kreuzberg (which is an overwhelmingly Turkish part of the city).

I'm aware of the racism directed towards Turks but they were key in rebuilding (West) Germany after WW2 since they were the largest group of Gastarbeiters who went to Germany as workers. Germany didn't expect that they would settle, and therefore ethnic Turks weren't given German citizenship even if they were born and raised in Germany whereas 'ethnic Germans' born and raised elsewhere were offered German citizenship. A pretty racist policy but the Turks had to deal with that and obviously it led to segregation. This ethnocentric view of citizenship and what it means to be German has definitely contributed to anti-immigrant sentiment and more importantly has made it very difficult for non-Germanic peoples to settle and live as equals.
 
 
Economic immigration, where every single person coming here can pay thier way, works, speaks the language, and integrates into society, which will be in the tens of thousands = GOOD

MASS immigration, i.e what we have had the past decade, in which huge strains are put on public services, housing, the NHS, welfare, rare relations, and public anger and leads to seperation and segregation = BAD

I doubt anybody can argue with any of the above, even the most hardline English hating leftie.

What Labour, and Blair, did to this country through mass immigration, is the most sickening act of treason ever seen in this country. 3-4 million immigrants in a decade?

Disgusting, and entirely deliberate.

Yesterday I thought that I would get into the Halloween spirit and scare the neighbours. I dressed up as an immigration officer...

 
 
 
i dont agree that foreigners do jobs that we dont want to do. i worked for carlisle cleaning services and cleaned for tesco. it was for a few hours a week just part time. carlisle sold their contract to TC contractors and after a few months of them being in charge me and a few others that worked there were sacked and replaced by some polish people. dont think they are taking our jobs???

The whole 'do jobs we don't want to do' line is trotted out by the muppets to justify it. The fact of the matter is that companies are more likely to take on migrant workers for menial jobs like cleaning because they're less likely to leave after a few weeks if offered another job.

Then there's been cases of employers making British workers on a £25k salary redundant and then immediately replacing them with migrant workers on £12k. Why? Because they can. Because British workers are more likely to demand a salary that befits their experience and the demands of the job, whereas migrant workers know they can't be fussy so work for peanuts. This is what they mean by 'migrant workers are willing to work for less', they're willing to work for minimum wage and live on the poverty line, whereas British workers rightfully demand the salary they deserve.

*There was a case reported where a company stopped employing the services of a welder who charged £33 per hour, a fair price for a welder. He was replaced by a migrant worker who charged £19 per hour and after a few weeks was called back, the migrant worker not being up to the standard they were used to. You pay peanuts, you get monkeys.

*I'm still looking for the source for this, before the "source?" brigade start complaining.
