Robben and Heinze to Real Madrid, for 36 and 12 million euros,
respectively. Cicinho to Roma for 8 million, Belletti to Chelsea for
5.5 million.

Roma was smart, Chelsea perhaps less so, though the price is
reasonable. Robben is injury prone, and the price seems very high.
Heinze might be worth his price if he finds a place in the team. I am
not sure that this experienced thug is a proper replacement for
Roberto Carlos, but time will tell. Didn't Calder√≥n and Schuster say
that they wanted "jogo bonito", unlike Capello? Mmmmm... I am still
wondering who will be a creative midfielder for RM. Guti? Mmmm.

Best,
