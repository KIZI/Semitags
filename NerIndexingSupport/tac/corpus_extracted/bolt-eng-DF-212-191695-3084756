This is a election to watch.

 Iran president hopefuls register 

 
5 May [BBC] Iranians hoping to stand as candidates in the presidential elections in June have begun signing up at the start of a five-day registration period.

Women putting their names forward will be considered this time, officials say. In previous elections, female candidates have all been disqualified.

President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has not yet formally declared his candidacy but is expected to stand.

Mr Ahmadinejad is facing mounting criticism especially over the economy.

The former prime minister, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who is considered the main challenger for Mr Ahmadinejad and the former parliament speaker, Mehdi Karroubi, have already announced their plan to stand.

President Ahmadinejad has been accused by reformists and conservatives alike of mishandling the economy and wasting Iran's windfall from high oil prices.

But the BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says Mr Ahmadinejad is a skilled exponent at obtaining and holding onto power, while the opposition is demoralised and divided.....
 
 
 
Israel, the US and the West may be very concerned on this issue. But Tehran says it is not for them in the June election.

 Nuclear talks not election issue in Iran 

 
TEHRAN, May 5 (UPI) -- The June 12 presidential elections in Iran play no role in ongoing talks on its controversial nuclear program, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi denied allegations that Tehran was balking on nuclear talks with the 5-plus-1 group -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany -- until after the presidential elections in June, the Tehran Times reports.

"The election issue, as an internal matter, has nothing to do with macro issues," Qashqavi told reporters. "Macro issues are not affected by elections."

He went on to say that despite the outcome of the June contest, the foreign policy of Iran would remain relatively static, as top candidates have stressed Iran has the right to pursue nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.....

 Nuclear talks not election issue in Iran 

 

"The election issue, as an internal matter, has nothing to do with macro issues," Qashqavi told reporters. "Macro issues are not affected by elections."

He's probably half-right in that. Macro issues however do affect elections. The nuke issue may be part of Iranian attempts to create external tensions to divert attention away from its internal problems, particularly its poor economy. Given sufficient intensity of macro issues, particularly those that rally "Iranian Pride" or "Us vs Them" kind of sentiments, and the ruling regime may receive popular mandate for quite a while.
 
 
The chief of Iran's TV monopoly yields to 'fairness' complaints and arrange TV debates by six presidential candidates. The election is on June 12. Campaigning starts on May 22.

 Iran presidential debates to be televised 

 
19 hrs ago TEHRAN (AFP)  Iran's state television is to air debates by candidates competing in the June presidential election, the broadcaster's chief Ezatollah Zarghami was quoted as saying by local media on Thursday.

"Six attractive televised debates are on the broadcaster's electoral agenda," Zarghami said, vowing "fairness" in coverage by his organisation which has a monopoly on broadcasting in Iran.

Such debates are not unprecedented in Iran, but Iranian politicians rarely take each other on face-to-face in public despite their differences.

Incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has faced mounting criticism in Iran mainly over his handling of the economy, has welcomed the plan.

Zarghami did not say when the debates would be broadcast but campaigning for the June 12 election begins on May 22 after a conservative electoral watchdog unveils the list of candidates allowed to stand.

Zarghami's comments follow complaints of bias by state television in favour of Ahmadinejad, who is seeking re-election.....

Earlier this month about 100 Mousavi supporters staged a protest at what they called the "electoral campaign in favour of Ahmadinejad on TV and radio" outside the state broadcasting centre in Tehran.....

State media gives comprehensive coverage of Ahmadinejad's tours around the country and to his speeches, leading to accusations that he was using them as election rallies even though formal campaigning has not yet begun.
 
 
 
As a writer in Atimes pointed out, the lack of American interest in the Iranian election at White House level is quite surprising. They should use the opportunity to undermine Ahmadinejad's chances of re-election, or perhaps they don't want to publicize the fact that they do have a democratic election for their Presidency over there.

The US has to be verrrry careful in how it treats Iranian elections. If the US were to tacitly back a candidate, that candidate would be in bad trouble. Any positive statement from the US would be regarded very negatively in Iran.

I also think you're right, it doesn't do well to point out that the mortal enemy of the US is in fact democratic, with occasionally fair elections.
 
 
'Iran's presidential race is officially on'.

 Iran election candidates approved 

 
3 hrs ago [PressAssoc] Iran's presidential race is officially on after a constitutional watchdog approved four candidates, including President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The Interior Ministry said that the country's Guardian Council gave the green light to Ahmadinejad and three other contenders to run in the June 12 balloting.

The three include prominent reformists Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi, and a conservative, Mohsen Rezaei.

The body had rejected 471 other candidates who wanted to run, including... 42 women.

Ahmadinejad faces a tough challenge. His popularity appears to be declining, and many blame him for the country's economic troubles.
 
 
 
Its too bad Khatami stepped out of the race. Had he won, it would've been a very positive thing for Iran having a cool headed moderate run the country rather than the idiotic moron Ahmedinijad who alienates his country even more from the international scene every time he opens his big mouth. Wonder what Hossein Mousavi brings to the table, or if hes anything like Khatami.

I think Khatami withdrew beforehand and give public support to Mousavi.

 
But many expect the 67-year-old Musavi to be Ahmadinejad's main challenger. The former prime minister, who describes himself as a fundamentalist reformer, has been publicly backed by former President Mohammad Khatami.

"I consider Musavi a religious intellectual," Khatami recently told backers in an effort to encourage them to throw their support behind Musavi. "Musavi's dedication to morals is among his outstanding traits, as is his sympathy for people."
 

The above quote is taken from here.  Four Candidates Approved To Run In Iran's Presidential Vote 
 
 
Looking at the election objectively who do you guys think will win?.
I personally felt Khatami was the only one capable of toppling the incumbent.

I did, that's why I used the past tense 'HAD'. IMO unless something dramatically alters the current situation, Ahmad.... will probably be returned.
and some commentators have suggested the population would probably rally around Ahmad......, If they feel that Iran is being unfairly picked upon.Perhaps thats why the West is being fairly quiet about the election.

What did Khatami do to blot his copybook?
 
 
 
What did Khatami do to blot his copybook?

 

Don't understand what you mean by "blot".

If you mean what he did whilst in power, then all I can say is that the man gave it his best shot to change or liberalize Iranian laws and society, it is a different matter that the religious leaders blocked almost all his moves. Though, it would still be better for Iran to have him lead who actually tries to do better for the society rather than A-jad. Even if Iran wants to go nuclear, civil or weapons, Khatami won't actually change world opinion against his country the way A-jad does, with his constant aggressive rants against Israel and US, he basically asks for world intervention against Iran.
 
 
 
Don't understand what you mean by "blot".

 

Sorry 'To Blot ones copybook' Basically means to do something which may ruin your record/ CV etc etc, thus falling out of favour with the powers that be., but explanation that a lot of his actions were blocked by the clerics could go somewhat towards explaining this.
Do you think that because of this, he was never going to be approved?
 
 
Iran's population is young, average age only 27. The opposition candidate Mousavi made use of social networking site Facebook to reach out to these young Iranian as well as reporters. This was promptly blocked, for some reason lifted, and blocked again.

 Iran blocks Facebook ahead of presidential election 

 
3 hr ago TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- The Iranian government has blocked access to the social networking site Facebook amid political jockeying for the June 12 presidential elections, according to the semi-official Iranian Labour News Agency.

Reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi -- a former prime minister considered a threat to current hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- created a Facebook page for his campaign that has more than 5,000 supporters on the site.

Those attempting to visit Facebook received a message in Farsi saying, "Access to this site is not possible," according to CNN personnel in Tehran.

ILNA reported the Masadiq Committee, made up of representatives from Iran's intelligence ministry, judiciary and others had ordered the action.

After a few hours, the blockage was lifted, but was then reinstated, ILNA said. No reason was given for the block....

Ahmadinejad's challengers are increasingly turning to new technology to spread their message, according to a May 13 article in the Financial Times newspaper.

Iran's population -- estimated at more than 66 million by July 2009, according to the CIA World Factbook -- has a median age of 27. The Financial Times, which put the country's population at 70 million, said 47 million Iranians have cell phones and 21 million have Internet access.

"We are using new technologies because they have the capacity to be multiplied by people themselves who can forward Bluetooth, e-mails and text messages and invite more supporters on Facebook," Behzad Mortazavi, head of Mousavi's campaign committee, told the Financial Times.

At a Mousavi rally at a stadium Saturday, the Facebook blockage was a topic of conversation among reporters....
 
 
 
They keep changing their mind.

 Iranians regain access to Facebook, Twitter 

 
4hrs ago TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- The online networking sites Facebook and Twitter were back in business for Iranians Tuesday, a day after the government banned the country's access to them, a freelance writer said.

The 28-year-old woman, who uses the name Shahrazad to protect her identity, said the sites were reactivated during the morning.

On Monday, CNN Correspondent Reza Sayah asked Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad about the shutdown of Facebook. He told the news conference he had not called for the ban but would look into it.

He added, "I believe in maximum freedom of expression."

After the briefing, access to Facebook was reinstated, but that ended a few hours later and the block remained in place until Tuesday morning. No reason was given for the block.....
 
 
 
...and lifted again.

Iran restores access to Facebook, days after blocking the site

 
TEHRAN, Iran — Access to the social networking website Facebook is back in Iran after being blocked late last week.

Facebook was cut off Saturday, leading to accusations that authorities were trying to muzzle one of the main campaign tools of reformists opposing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June 12 elections.

The main pro-reform candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, is seeking a strong turnout from young voters and has used Facebook to try to mobilize support.

Authorities have not directly commented on the Facebook outage, and the reason for its return today was not immediately clear.

They should use the opportunity to undermine Ahmadinejad's chances of re-election, or perhaps they don't want to publicize the fact that they do have a democratic election for their Presidency over there.

 

The reason why Ahmadinejad was elected in the first place is because the clerics banned all the reformers. They may have elections, but its still a theocracy.
 
 
Here is a good comparison of the campaign positions of the four candidates.

So which one would you vote for if you were an Iranian?

 FACTBOX: Issues in Iran's presidential election race 

 
28 May TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iranians vote on June 12 in a presidential election that will test the popularity of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad against rivals who criticize his combative stance on the nuclear issue and his handling of the economy.

Following are some of the campaign issues and positions of the four candidates cleared to run by the Guardian Council:

NUCLEAR
The candidates have promised no major change in Iran's nuclear policy, saying such matters of state are decided by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but they have signaled subtle differences in approach. Moderates, such as former Prime Minister Mirhossein Mousavi and former Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karoubi, have faulted Ahmadinejad for isolating Iran by denying the Holocaust and making fiery anti-Western speeches. However, no candidate has suggested that Iran could address the West's concerns over its nuclear program and halt sensitive work.

RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES
As in the 2005 presidential election, all candidates have said they are open to the idea of resuming relations with the United States. This reflects how popular such a move would be among Iranians weary of a rift that has lasted almost three decades. But nearly all the candidates demand "fundamental" changes in U.S. policy toward Iran. These could include removing the Islamic Republic from the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors or unfreezing billions of dollars in Iranian assets seized in the United States after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

ECONOMY
Candidates have offered few detailed ideas on how to improve the economy in Iran, which has the world's second biggest oil and gas reserves. Critics say the government did not save enough when oil prices were high to maintain spending after they fell below $40 a barrel in February from a July peak of $147. Prices have since firmed to almost $60 a barrel. Many Iranians complain of inflation, which hit almost 30 percent last year but which dipped to 12.5 percent in April, and rising unemployment.....

Ahmadinejad's spending policies have been criticised as inflationary and wasteful of windfall oil revenue earned by the world's fifth biggest crude exporter. He has promised to alleviate poverty and reduce dependence on oil income, which accounts for 80 percent of hard currency earnings. His power base rests on poorer segments of Iran's 70 million people.

HUMAN RIGHTS
All candidates have promised to uphold freedom of speech and improve women's participation in government and decision-making in Iran, often criticised abroad for its human rights record. Karoubi and Mousavi have opposed Ahmadinejad's drive to enforce what hardliners define as Islamic dress and social behavior.
 
 
 
Even before the election date, there were attacks at mosque and campaign office.

 Iranian Media: 19 Killed in Blast at Shi'ite Mosque in Iran 

 
29 May [VOA] Iran's official news agency says a suicide attack killed 19 people and wounded 125 others at a Shi'ite mosque in Zahedan, the capital of Sistan-Baluchistan province near Iran's border with Pakistan.

Provincial governor Ali-Mohammed Azad told the IRNA news agency the bombing Thursday was a terrorist act, and that the government has already arrested the perpetrators.

Azad said the bombers had been planning additional attacks. He said the attacks were meant to destabilize the province as it prepares for June 12 presidential elections.....

TEHRAN, May 29 (UPI) -- Gunmen fired on a campaign office of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Friday, wounding two adults and a child, officials said....

Ahmadinejad, who is running for a second term, was not at the office.....
 
 
 
I think this is the first Iran election that they have such open televised debates between the Presidential candidates. This one below is part of a series, and probably the most interesting one.

 Iran's president, rival, spar in debate 

 
Leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tangles with Mir-Hossein Mousavi, a former prime minister and one of his opponents in the presidential race. The hard-hitting encounter is part of a series of debates.

2 hrs ago [LATimes] Tehran -- Iran's president waved an apparent intelligence file on his challenger's wife in the air Wednesday night, accusing her of violating government rules in an explosive televised debate that laid bare the rifts within the country's establishment.

Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the aging former prime minister who is the leading contender against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the presidential election next week, kept his cool and struck back forcefully, defending his wife as a dedicated scholar and artist and accusing the incumbent of using the instruments of state to dig up dirt on his opponents.

"This is typical of your government," he told Ahmadinejad. "Instead of finding solutions, you send your deputies to make files on the people."

The long-anticipated 90-minute encounter, watched by more than 40 million people, was the second in a series of seven live one-on-one debates among the four presidential contenders.

The two candidates attacked each other unremittingly, touching on sensitive issues such as human rights, Iran's involvement in the Arab-Israeli conflict and its relations with the United States in a freewheeling format rare on state television.

Mousavi, struggling with his words during the beginning of the debate, hammered hard at Ahmadinejad's foreign policy, accusing him of needlessly alienating other countries. He mocked what he described as Ahmadinejad's erratic behavior during several crises and trips abroad and repeatedly criticized Ahmadinejad for questioning the existence of the Holocaust, which he said hurt Iran's national interests and unified the world behind Israel, Tehran's rival....
 
 
 
You can only think that with Obama in power and Dinejad getting voted out that things would cool off considerably, although Israels' Netanyhu (sp) is a spanner in the works.

Not that I know how it's all going down there in Iran but I doubt that the new guy will win, seems like Mahmud has already consolidated quite alot of power
 
 
This is a rare poll, and difficult to conduct. It was conducted last month, which means before Obama's Cairo speech.

 Poll: Few Iranians see US favorably, despite Obama 

 
8 hrs ago WASHINGTON (AP) — Few Iranians have favorable opinions of the United States, a view that has changed little since the election of an American president who has expressed a willingness to talk to Tehran, a rare poll of Iranian citizens showed Monday.

Even so, the survey shows Iranians continue to strongly want their country to adopt democratic institutions like free elections and a free press, the poll showed. There also remains a widespread willingness to stage unconditional negotiations with the U.S. following nearly three decades of diplomatic estrangement between the two countries.

Just 29 percent of Iranians said they have favorable views of the United States in the latest poll, which was conducted last month. In a similar survey in February 2008 — nearly a year before Barack Obama became president — 34 percent had positive opinions about the U.S.

In a further sign of wariness toward the United States, 38 percent in last month's poll said the U.S. is the greatest threat to Iran. Only Israel was ranked higher — 44 percent of Iranians said the Jewish state posed the greatest threat to their country.

Accurate public opinion polls are a rarity in Iran, whose Islamic rulers enforce strict rules of behavior and where dissidents are often imprisoned. The survey was conducted by telephone from a nearby country that the sponsors declined to identify for security reasons.

The poll was conducted for Terror Free Tomorrow, a bipartisan group that tries to undermine support for terrorism, and for the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan public policy institute. Both are based in Washington.....
 
 
 
The candidates are holding their final rallies before campaign has to stop a day before the poll on Friday.

 Iran's Ahmadinejad, Mousavi Hold Final Rallies Ahead of Election 

 
10 June [VOA] Tensions are high among Iran's presidential candidates on the last day of campaigning ahead of Friday's elections.

Incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his chief election rival Mir Hossein Mousavi have repeatedly accused each other of lying to the public in a bitterly contested campaign that has highlighted Iran's deep political divisions.

Mr. Ahmadinejad used a rally in Tehran Wednesday to accuse his rivals of adopting smear tactics used by Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler. He said his challengers are lying by describing the economy as weak and compared their methods to those of Hitler.

Leading reformist presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi has criticized Mr. Ahmadinejad for describing the Nazi German Holocaust as a myth, saying such remarks isolate Iran....

Campaigning for Iran's election is due to end Thursday morning, 24 hours before polls open....
 
 
 
 
'Effective action'

The last day of campaigning was also coloured by an intervention by Mr Rafsanjani, who was Mr Ahmadinejad's main opponent in the 2005 elections, and was himself president from 1989 to 1997 and currently heads the Expediency Council - Iran's main political arbitration body.

In an open letter to the supreme leader published by several newspapers, he said Mr Ahmadinejad's statements threatened to undermine the Islamic revolution.

He had personally told the president to take back his remarks, which he described as "irresponsible and untruthful", he said. He asked Ayatollah Khamenei to resolve the dispute.

"I ask your eminence, given your position, responsibility and personality, to solve this problem and act in a way you deem right to take effective action in eliminating the mutiny," the former president said, quoted by AFP news agency.

Fourteen high-ranking clerics echoed the complaint.
 

 BBC NEWS | Middle East | Iran's Ahmadinejad lambasts opponents 

This is a pretty big deal, 14 clerics and a former president calling out Ahmadenijad. I wonder if Khamenei will actually get involved before the election.

Things are getting pretty intense. I've seen and heard coverage in a lot of places that would not normally be dealing with Iranian politics. This is a pretty heated election; good for Iran.
 
 
 
... I wonder if Khamenei will actually get involved before the election.....

 

I don't think so. Being the Supreme Leader, he comes in only when things get out of hand, or are clearly going in the wrong direction.
 
 
This is a good set of Q&A from Reuters on the Iran President and Supreme Leader.

 Q&A: How powerful is the Iranian president? 

 
11 June (Reuters) - Whoever wins Iran's presidential election on Friday will enjoy only limited power in the Islamic Republic's complex system of clerical rule and popular voting.

HOW DOES THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC WORK?
In a referendum after the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iranians overwhelmingly approved the creation of an Islamic Republic to replace the U.S.-supported monarchy. Later that year they backed a new constitution for a hybrid political system combining elements of democracy with unelected religious leadership....

HOW POWERFUL IS THE PRESIDENT?
In theory, the president's powers are second only to those of the Supreme Leader, a post occupied by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since 1989. In practice, his freedom of action is also curtailed by a range of unelected bodies mostly controlled by hardline clerics.....

WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT DO?
He is responsible for economic policy and, along with his cabinet of ministers, daily management of national affairs. The president chairs the Supreme National Security Council, which coordinates defense and security policy....

WHAT DOES THE SUPREME LEADER DO?
The Supreme Leader, appointed by an assembly of senior clerics elected by popular vote, has the final say in vital matters such as nuclear policy and foreign relations, especially any decision to repair ties with the United States....
 
 
 
After the clerics speak out, the Revolutionary Guard bites back:

 Al Jazeera English - Middle East - Iran Guard warns reformist groups 

 
The political chief of Iran's Revolutionary Guard has warned reformists in the country against seeking what he called a "velvet revolution", vowing that it would be "nipped in the bud".

Yadollah Javani's comments appeared aimed at Mir Hossein Mousavi, a reformist candidate in the country's presidential elections and followed another day of bitter exchanges between Mousavi and his rival and current president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The Revolutionary Guard is one of the pillars of the Iranian establishment and controls large military forces as well as a nationwide network of militia.

In a statement on its website, Javani drew parallels between Mousavi's campaign and the "velvet revolution'' that led to the 1989 overthrow of the communist government in then Czechoslovakia.

"There are many indications that some extremist [reformist] groups, have designed a colourful revolution... using a specific colour for the first time in an election," the statement said.
 

This is getting interesting indeed. It seems as though the Guard is getting nervous, they're feeling people and politicians turning against their power. That representatives of the Revolutionary Guard and ruling Clerics are taking potshots at each other I think demonstrates that even these powerful entities don't really know how the election is going to go.

12 hours until morning of the election day. This is going to be super interesting. I really wonder how the results will be taken. If Ahmadenijad wins, will the legions of young, excited reformists believe the polls were fair? What if they didn't? If Mousavi wins, will the Revolutionary Guard resort to more open action? This election is doing a great job of demonstrating where power really lies in Iran.
 
 
I smell a potential powder keg here.
 
 
Voting has been extended in Iran by 2 hours, a sign of very high turnout in the elections.
 
 
Good for them. They need a new leader thats more about the people and less about firey rhetoric.
 
 
The question is whether the Cleric and revolutionary Guard will accept that. Iran is first and foremost a theocracy and they have done things to discourage reform in the past.
 
 
Here are the results, close to a final count, but being disputed.

 Ahmadinejad set for victory in disputed Iran vote 

 
TEHRAN (AFP)  Hardline incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was heading for a thumping victory in Iran's fiercely-contested presidential race, official results showed, in a major upset for his moderate rival.

"Doctor Ahmadinejad, by getting a majority of the votes, has become the definite winner of the 10th presidential election," state news agency IRNA declared as his jubilant supporters took to the streets in celebration.

However, his main challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi -- who pledged to improve relations with the outside world during the most heated election campaign since the Islamic revolution -- also declared himself the victor, suggesting a tense battle lay ahead.

Ahmadinejad won 65 percent of the vote against more than 32 percent for war-time premier Mousavi, with almost 90 percent of ballot boxes counted, said election commission chief Kamran Daneshjoo, highlighting the massive turnout.....
 
 
 
The Persians are very strange. On one side they hate the Islamic government but one the side they don't want to do anything to fight it. I believe not all of the population participated in this vote. Like the ones I met in Germany. They had chance to go to Frankfurt to vote but none of them did it.
Mousavi vowed to fight against fraud which means there may be some unrest but personally I think nothing will happen.
 
 
The situation there is rather complex, see below. But I don't think Mousavi has any chance of getting a recount or a re-election.

 Ahmadinejad Declared Winner of Iran Election 

 
Clashes Break Out Among Voters as Challenger Mousavi Disputes Results

TEHRAN, June 13 -- Iran's Interior Ministry declared Saturday that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a decisive victory in Friday's presidential election, but the incumbent's leading challenger protested the results, and clashes broke out between the two candidates' supporters.

Mir Hossein Mousavi, a former prime minister who waged a heated campaign against Ahmadinejad's bid for reelection, urged his supporters to reject a "governance of lie and dictatorship." He attributed the results to widespread vote fraud and vowed to resist a "dangerous manipulation" of the balloting.

Later, fighting broke out at Tehran's Vanak Square among hundreds of Iranians who backed the rival candidates, Reuters news agency reported. Up to 2,000 Mousavi supporters sat down in the street, chanting: "Mousavi take back our vote! What happened to our vote?"

Police wielding batons then moved to disperse the protesters, the news agency said.

Iran's Interior Ministry announced that Ahmadinejad had won 62.6 percent of the vote in the election. The ministry said Mousavi received less than 34 percent.....
 
 
 
I think Ahmaninedjad has found a model in Chavez. He played the populist card, pleased the crowd with cheap anti US slogans and showered his clientele (the poor and the rurals) with subsidies that economically make no sense and ultimately wreck the economy but as long as it secures his seat....

I wish Bush had dealt with him like he did with the "Bolivarian" clown. Just ignore him...
 
 
I think this election was a farce. Nevermind the selection of candidates and the remorseless use of state resources to help one of them. People who seem to know about the insight of the regime predicted the votes wouldn't even be counted. I can't be sure of this last claim, but seems plausible.

You can't ignore A-jad or Chavez for that matter. If the barrel was $20 or less though, they would be like Mugabe and could be more or less ignored.
 
 
Looks like riots going on across Iran. BBC says thick black plumes of smoke reported.

YOU DONT KNOW US. IRANIAN PEOPLE DO NOT ACCEPT THESE BOGUS ELECTION RESULTS.
 
 
There are people from Tehran writing comments in the Spanish press and calling for protests against the what they see as a rigged election, I think is very moving.
 
 
This illegal government is trying to have a media blackout of what is happening and are beating up the people. Everyone knows these election results are rigged. These photos are mixture of media pictures and pictures taken by protesters and uploaded by them onto the internet earlier in the day. The people wear green to show support for Mir-Hossein Mousavi:
 
 
More:
 
 
Thats the internet....I don't know how it is in real life.

Its sad but I would think that the majority of Iranians still support Ahmadinedjad.
 
 
I've been warning of the Guards for sometime, this is rather more overt than I expected but hopefully now the clerics will move while they still can.
 
 
1980s, are you writing directly from Iran?

I ask because I read somewhere that the BBC, Facebook and such websites have been blocked from the elections. Also, I use a software program to watch live television stations from around the world and in the last couple of days Iranian channels (Press TV, Iran NTV, and Iran TV3) have been cut off and don't broadcast anymore.
 
 
Iran elections: anger on the streets of Tehran
Riding around Tehran in dozen-strong posses, the groups of black-clad public order police on motorbikes looked like a bunch of Hells Angels in search of trouble.

And on Saturday afternoon, on the wide, treelined boulevard of Vali-asr Avenue in the city centre, they found it in spades, as tens of thousands of protesters, furious at Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's questionable election victory, yelled a defiant cry in their faces: "Death to the dictator".

Vali-asr Ave stretches some 12 miles from the very north of Tehran to the very south, and is said to be the longest street in the Middle East. In the past week, however, it has also earned a different claim to fame – as the gathering point for supporters of Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the reformist challenger tipped to unseat Mr Ahmadinejad's in Friday's polls.
Yesterday, despite an official order banning demonstrations, it also became the venue for the biggest display of open defiance that the Iranian regime has seen in years. At midmorning, there were just a few hundred people there, with nervous-looking police dishing out beatings to any man or woman who attempted to loiter for any time.

But by lunchtime the crowds were growing, and by 4pm the streets were packed as far as the eye could see – mainly people in their 20s, but also their parents and even grandparents.

"People, come and support us," shouted the bolder groups, as the police started menacingly. Up went the cry, at first sporadic, but soon as a constant chant: "Marg Bar Dictator" (Death to the Dictator)

Then, as the protesters began to throw rocks, the police finally charged.

Having first badly beaten a few demonstrators who didn't escape in time, the riot squads went on a riot themselves, hurling rocks into the windows of nearby residential flats and smashing shop windows with their truncheons.

Joining them in their official vandalism were a number of civilians – believed to be basijis, the plain-clothes, pro-regime thugs that Iran's clerical regime deploys to both intimidate and mislead. Mousavi supporters who witnessed the destruction knew straightaway what tomorrow's Iranian newspaper headlines would be: "Reformists go on rampage."

"They were just vandalising everything and smashing windows, so that they could say publicly that it was the protesters' fault," said Abbas Mohammed, 26, watching in horror as the police laid into a woman protester. "This is their typical tactic."

By 6pm, as summer stormclouds gathered and lightning snaked down over the Alborz mountains that ring Tehran the crowds around Vali-asr Ave had dispersed. But in the distant streets, the sounds of further trouble could be heard, with demonstrators shouting and occasional bangs and crashes.

Palls of smoke rose up from side streets, while in shop entrances groups of demonstrators nursed people bleeding from truncheon wounds. Groups of basjis wandered around menacingly, clutching sticks of wood.

The police crackdown was chilling confirmation of last Wednesday's warning from a senior member of Iran's hardline Revolutionary that any attempt at a "Velvet Revolution" by Mr Mousavi's youthful supporters would be nipped firmly in the bud.

It was a sour end to a sour day, that had begun in the small hours of Saturday morning when Iran's interior ministry had announced that President Ahmadinejad had an unassailable lead in the vote. His victory came despite widespread predictions that he might head for a crashing defeat, amid widespread anger at his dismal economic policies and aggression towards the West.

Yet nobody in the reformist camp was that surprised at his 61.6 per cent showing. Why, they said, the authorities had simply rigged the vote again, just as they did in 2005, when Mr Ahmadinejad – then a virtual unknown – first came to power.

"There was a joke going around town that if there was no vote rigging, Mr Ahmadinejad would come fifth out of four candidates," said Mr Mohammed. "Now it doesn't seem so funny."

With no international observers present in Iran's elections, the supporters of Mr Mousavi know there is little chance that any alleged skulduggery will be revealed, never mind rectified. But as they chatted on the streets on Saturday, they noted all manner of suspicious things.

Why had Iran's text message system been switched off since Friday, the system they used to organise rallies? Why was the BBC Persian website blocked, along with a number of other reformist websites normally available? And most curious of all, why did Iran's official new agency announce early in the morning that Mr Ahmadinejad had already only won, when at that time, only 20 per cent of the vote had been counted?

Yet while the reformists might have lost the election on Saturday, the country's mullahs also seemed to have lost the confidence of their people.

The free and good-natured street campaigning last week generated a huge expectation that Iran was finally on the brink of a new era, with many comparing the vast pre-election crowds to those who greeted Ayatollah Khomeini when he arrived in Tehran to start the Islamic revolution in 1979.

But just as the optimism of that time quickly faded, so now has the optimism of last week. "I cannot see anybody wanting to participate in any kind of politics after this," said Mitra Khorshidi, 26, a government worker who attended last week's cheerful pro-Mousavi rallies. "But it has also been a defeat for the mullahs. They had a chance to regain the trust of the people and they lost it."

By 7pm, as trouble flared up yet again in Vali-asr Ave, and riot police laid into another female onlooker, word spread on the streets of another dubious official statement from the interior ministry. It declared that there had been "no post-election violence" in Tehran.

Seen it before to often to have much hope.The young Iranians have my sympathies,but they have little chance.Unless somehow the clerics decide to commit suicide and turn on A-jad,the Guard and the Basij.It still depends on the scale of protests.The larger,the better.
 
 
I am not posting from Iran and yes i have also been told that sms service (in Tehran at least) has been disrupted (possibly also mobile networks) and facebook, youtube and other websites have been filtered in Iran to prevent the truth from coming out. There are also rumours that Mir-Hossein Mousavi is under house arrest. His websites have been taken offline.
 
 
 
Its sad but I would think that the majority of Iranians still support Ahmadinedjad.

 

So what makes you think so?

Stalin said that it matters not who people vote for; what matters is who counts the votes. This regime looks like being quite capable of something like that.

Look at the people in the pictures, they could be from Madrid. So I don't know the situation in the rural areas, but these people don't come out of the blue, it seems awkward that A-jad should represent them.
 
 
 
I think Ahmaninedjad has found a model in Chavez. He played the populist card, pleased the crowd with cheap anti US slogans and showered his clientele (the poor and the rurals) with subsidies that economically make no sense and ultimately wreck the economy but as long as it secures his seat....

I wish Bush had dealt with him like he did with the "Bolivarian" clown. Just ignore him...

 

Its hard to when he's working on a nuke.

I feel for the Iranian people. Hopefully this is the sign of them being fed up and not willing to take it anymore. They deserve better.
 
 
I'm watching the protests from liveleak.com its fkn insaneeeeeee

That stuff is simply amazing and awe inspiring. I have nothing but respect and admiration for the younger generation of Iranians.
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. " Today it may be the patriots but tomorrow it will be the tyrants. I think the genie is out of the bottle and will be difficult to return. I don't think the hardline government or rule can survivewithout some real concessions to the "greens" even if the rigged elction does stand.
That's a lot of pent up hopes and hostility for the way things are being shown to the world. All those videos just leave me speechless us americans are suckers for republican protests! To go out in the streets when they know they could be beaten and jailed if not killed takes a lot of courage. /salute I just hope the Israelis dont bomb now. An outside threat to rally people around the flag is the hard-liners dream right now. I would think this might be a tenser time on the gulf for our navy. I understand it's pretty bad now with radar games but, they might be tempted to create a real incident to rally the people
 
 
 
 
Whilst the possibility of of fraudulent election process and the brutality of the authorities is not what any body should have to live with, would the return of Ahmadinejad matter that much and is it such a bad thing?

The following article from the National Review Online, The corner, makes some very good points to consider.

Eye on Iran [Kathryn Jean Lopez]

Tomorrow is election day in Iran. I asked our friend, AEI's Iran expert, Michael Rubin some questions about what to watch.

KATHRYN JEAN LOPEZ: How real is this election in Iran tomorrow?

MICHAEL RUBIN: In a sense, the elections are real. Fraud is a problem and election tallies are often tinkered with (indeed, this enabled Ahmadinejad to avoid elimination in the first round back in 2005) but this year, four candidates have engaged in a real campaign, and held real debates. That said, the worst thing any analyst can do is engage in projection, and assume that Iranian elections are equivalent to elections elsewhere. In the Islamic Republic, for example, a Council of Guardians determines who can and cannot compete in elections. This year, less than 1 percent of applicants were allowed to compete. Only those that agree with the Supreme Leader can run. An analogy would be if the Soviet Union held elections in the 1970s, but only candidates that espoused the policies of Leonid Brezhnev could compete. In such circumstances, we would hardly call the Soviet Union a democracy.

As a result, Iranian elections are much more about style than about substance. Theres a tendency among analysts to amplify differences, but when it comes to key U.S. policy concerns: Irans nuclear ambitions, violent opposition to the Middle East peace process, and support for terrorism, there are none. Remember, that it was under pragmatist President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and reformist President Mohammad Khatami that the Islamic Republic not only built up its nuclear capability but also, according to the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, experimented with warhead design.

The last thing to remember is that the real power in the Islamic Republic rests with the Office of the Supreme Leader, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and, in the economic sphere, with the Revolutionary Foundations.

LOPEZ: Should we want Ahmadinejad to lose the election this weekend?

RUBIN: The Obama administration tends to conflate advocacy with analysis. They see in the Islamic Republic what they want to see, not what the Iranian leaderships intentions really are. As such, should someone more soft-spoken and less defiant  someone like former prime minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi  win, it would be easier for Obama to believe that Iran really was figuratively unclenching a fist when, in fact, it had it had its other hand hidden under its cloak, grasping a dagger. What Ahmadinjead did was to expose the ideology of the power holders in Iran for what it actually is. Holocaust denial, for example, is nothing new to the Islamic Republic. Both Rafsanjani and Khatami also encourage it. Ahmadinejads bluntness, however, forced even the Europeans to react.

LOPEZ: Does he disappear if that happens?

RUBIN: No one in the Islamic Republic ever fades away until they die. The Supreme Leader maintains power by balancing factions and personalities against each other. When Rafsanjani got too big for his britches, he magically failed to even win elections to parliament. Likewise, Mousavi disappeared for 20 years, only to re-emerge as Ahmadinejads strongest challenger.

LOPEZ: Who is Mir-Hussein Mousavi and what kind of president would he make?

RUBIN: As prime minister throughout the Iran-Iraq War, he sought to ease Irans international isolation; however, he did this without seeking to compromise the Islamic Republics fundamental policy positions. Behind Mousavis soft-spoken exterior, he is a fervent revolutionary who purged the universities of Western-educated intellectuals and argued for an invasion of Israel. As president, Mousavi would be the face of the regime. He would not delight in antagonism as Ahmadinejad does, but he would not make the substantive changes to or compromises on policy that any real rapprochement will require. Domestically, he has painted himself as a reformer, promising, for example, to abolish the morality police that harass women showing too much hair and young men dressing in too Western a fashion. But, he really would have no control over security matters and so he would face widespread disgruntlement quickly. We would also see a resurgence of the vigilante groups (I wrote my first book about this phenomenon) who, in a manner analogous to Brown Shirts, would rough up opponents to prevent implementation of policies of which their hardline bosses disapprove.

LOPEZ: What's Rafsanjani's role in this race?

RUBIN: Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad represent two separate polls in Islamic Republic politics. Rafsanjani, likely the wealthiest man in Iran, represents the Islamic Republic elite. Ahmadinejad represents the so-called Principalists (usulgaryan) who seek to revive the spirit and principles of the Revolutions early years. Ahmadinejad has used Rafsanjani as the archetype of the corrupt politician who has perverted the revolution. Even those who may disagree with Ahmadinejads religious views will find his populism attractive, as many resent the class which Rafsanjani represents for using their positions for personal gain.

LOPEZ: How will the Cedar Revolution from last week's Lebanon election going to effect Iran?

RUBIN: Not much. Some reformists say it highlights Irans isolation, but Ahmadinejad can argue that he oversaw rapprochement with Arab states, expanded Iranian influence in Africa and South America, was welcomed at Columbia University, and even brought America to the table.

LOPEZ: What's Netanyahu watching for?

RUBIN: There are three different assessments of the Iranian nuclear challenge. Europe looks at the Iranian nuclear challenge in terms of being a threat to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the efficacy of multilateralism. The United States looks at the Iranian nuclear challenge in terms of strategic tenability. Israel sees a nuclear weapons-capable Islamic Republic as an existential threat. Netanyahu is waiting to see if the United States will act in a serious fashion to deny the Islamic Republic nuclear weapons capability. If he determines that the United States is willing to accommodate Iran, he will act unilaterally, even if he has no good unilateral options.

LOPEZ: How should President Obama respond, whatever happens?

RUBIN: He should judge Iran by its actions, not its words. He should verify, but he should never trust. He should not project, but recognize that the Islamic Republics strategists do not think like him. He should stop conflating advocacy with analysis.

I think all of the above and inevitably the Iranian people if as the article suggests, an elected president who was less outwardly antagonistic but still followed the same couse that has been set by the supreme Guardian.

Cheers.
 
 
Israel is watching the Iran election results with concern.

 Israel: Iran results intensify threat 

 
(CNN) -- Israel warned Sunday that the apparent re-election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad represented "an intensification of the Iranian threat," and called for redoubled international efforts to halt its nuclear program.

"After Ahmadinejad's re-election, the international community must continue to act uncompromisingly to prevent the nuclearization of Iran, and to halt its activity in support of terror organizations and undermining stability in the Middle East," Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said......
 
 
 
 
So what makes you think so?

Stalin said that it matters not who people vote for; what matters is who counts the votes. This regime looks like being quite capable of something like that.

Look at the people in the pictures, they could be from Madrid. So I don't know the situation in the rural areas, but these people don't come out of the blue, it seems awkward that A-jad should represent them.

 

What makes you think the contrary? Because the White house spokesperson said so ?

These protesters come mostly from the enlightened urban elite. And they are extremely pissed off to see this man who represents everything they hate and despise reelected. But they are the urban elite, not the whole nation.

After Bush won the elections in 2004 the European Media were so stunned, how could the Americans, these "Liberal" Americans who were all over the place in interviews on European televisions, reconduct this man? Simple, because Americans are not European progressives.

 
Its hard to when he's working on a nuke.

I feel for the Iranian people. Hopefully this is the sign of them being fed up and not willing to take it anymore. They deserve better.

 

Kim Jong Il is even more insane. North Korea is the last living Stalinian regime on earth. He's working on a bomb too. You don't make such a fuss about it and negociations are still preceived as the only way to solve the problem. So why not Iran?
 
 
Supposedly, 24 millions voted for the A-jad. If that is so, then where are they?

Why arent they expressing their happiness?

 BBC NEWS | Middle East | Crowds join Ahmadinejad victory rally 

 
Tens of thousands of people have joined a rally in central Tehran to celebrate the re-election of Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Crowds thronged the main thoroughfare, Vali Asr street, waving Iranian flags and chanting in jubilation.

The president's closest opponent in the election, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, has lodged an official appeal against the result amid continuing angry protests.

Mr Ahmadinejad denied any vote-fixing, saying the result was "very accurate".

Streets sealed off

He told the rally that elections in the Islamic republic had never been healthier and that the people alone had decided the outcome.

"Some people want democracy only for their own sake," he said, referring to his critics both inside and outside of Iran.

"Some want elections, freedom, a sound election. They recognise it only as long as the result favours them."

He said Iranians were united, but with 40 million people taking part it in the election it was natural for some to be disappointed.

Clashes between the police and anti-Ahmadinejad protesters continued on Sunday, with several parts of the city sealed off by the authorities to prevent the unrest spreading.

US doubt

Earlier, Mr Ahmadinejad told reporters that the debate over
"belongs to the past", and that Iran had "embraced" the idea of an international effort to eliminate nuclear weapons.

Global reaction to the election has been muted, but US Vice-President Joe Biden told broadcaster NBC he had doubts about the result.

"There's an awful lot of questions about how this election was run, but we'll see, we're just waiting to see, we don't have a enough facts to make a firm judgement," he said.

Mr Ahmadinejad's closest rival in the election campaign, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, announced on Sunday he had lodged an official appeal appeal against the result to.

"I urge you, Iranian nation, to continue your nationwide protests in a peaceful and legal way," he said in a statement.

Mr Mousavi has called several times for his supporters to avoid violence, but angry protesters have been setting light to vehicles and throwing stones in Tehran.

Reuters reported that police charged a 2,000-strong group of students who were protesting at the University of Tehran.

Leader's endorsement

Dozens of activists have been arrested, with reports saying those detained were members of pro-reformist political parties which had backed Mr Mousavi during the election campaign.

IRANIAN ELECTION
# Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: 62.6%
# Mir Hossein Mousavi: 33.8%
# Mohsen Rezai: 1.7%
# Mehdi Karroubi 0.9%
# Turnout: 85% Source: Interior ministry

Those held were said to include Mohammad Reza Khatami, brother of former President Mohammad Khatami.

Many of them are reported to have been freed since.

The state news agency, Irna, said those arrested were involved in orchestrating Saturday's protests in Tehran.

The controversy flared after a high turnout on Friday - estimated at 85% - led Mr Mousavi's supporters to expect a close result.

But official results gave Mr Ahmadinejad a landslide victory. His final share of the vote was almost 63%.

The result was quickly endorsed by Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader.

Our correspondent John Simpson, in Tehran, says the truth about the election may never be known.

But many observers in Iran feel that the final result did not reflect the extraordinary numbers of people who turned out to vote, our correspondent adds.
 

Besides, Ahmadenijad supporters are mostly rural anyway. Its the Mousavi supporters (young, educated and excited) that have been out on the street before the elections in large numbers. Its to be expected that its them that are on the streets now, if the vote was rigged or not.
 
 
Iranians in rural areas don't really matter, majority of Iranians live in the cities and all major decisions of recent Iranian history have taken by the people in big cities.
Here is my own reasoning why this election was fraudulent:

At the end of 2005 run off Islamic Ripofflic claimed A-jad had about 17 and Rafsanjani had 12 mil. votes. Lets presume all #s are legit.
Now the same Gov. claims A-jad has over 24 mil.
Considering level of the grave misery this creature has inflicted on the country within this past 4 years in which millions of his own initial supporters have turned their back to him and join his massive critiques/opposition camp, how the heck in the world not only he hasn't lost a single supporter but he has managed to accumulate over 7 million more?
Comparing to the last Selection, 13 million more Iranian cast their votes just to make sure A-jad will not remain in the office.
Around 6 PM Friday afternoon all news coming from people observing ballot boxes including the Representative of candidates in voting areas indicated Mousavi has won by a landslide.
A-jad's own advisores were preparing his soon congratulatory phone call to Mousavi but every thing changed when the boxes were sealed and transferred to Ministry of Interior a sealed building by well armed guards.
Mousavi lost in his homtown. ya right!!
Friday night Supreme Tyrant gave the green light to Mahsooli (minister of interior and A-jad's long time buddy) to go ahead with contingency plan and orchestrate the soft coup de'etate.
Time and time I've read in WAB that "Why Iranians don't rise up for their freedom and get rid of this rotten oligarchic theocracy ". Well! Time is up.
Now that Iranians have put their lives on a silver plate by protesting this murderous regime I'm expecting the Free World not remain indifferent and support Iranians who have been struggling for their inalienable civil liberty for over 100 years.
 
 
1980s
Appreciate your hard work. Thank you Hammeehan.
I also checked your work in I.D, outstanding.
 
 
 
Supposedly, 24 millions voted for the A-jad. If that is so, then where are they?

Why arent they expressing their happiness?

 

Fraudulent papers have no emotions.  
 
 
So I'm hearing lots of interesting rumours via twitter:

Tanks in Tehran infront of the Interior Ministry
The Revolutionary Guard and/or Armed forces declared neutrality (which one?)
Lots of refromist politicians arrested
Street protests ongoing.

I sure don't know what to believe, but its safe to say there is quite a lot happening in Iran right now.

You'd have to be naive to think that A-jod won it fair and square. Apparently there's some very funny voting "irregularities" that's happened. Can't find a proper list/news article but it goes along the line of areas having the exact same vote count for A-jod etc.. and that even the other guy's homeland somehow voted for A-jod too and there's absolutely no way that he won this fair and square. I feel sorry for all those Iranians but at the end of the day it's their country, they let themselves down when they let the CIA/West mess them around and install the Shah, from their point of view they managed to finally do what they wanted with their whole revolution but now it seems like they're gonna have to do some shit all over again.

What is it with that country
 
 
 
The Revolutionary Guard and/or Armed forces declared neutrality

 

If this particular one is true, then it is very significant because it opens the door for a revolution.

Traxus,
I don't believe they are remaining separate anymore all regular armed forces commanders including chief of the staff are all former thoroughbred IRGC generals.
IMHO they have to choices,
Either support the regime even if they have to slaughter Iranians,
Or as Zraver always mentions just move in and completely take over the system and mount their own temporary military government. I tend to believe the latter will happen sooner or later, new and massive uprising might just hasten the cause.
Why should an armed forces who receive annual operating budget from Gov. accumulate so much civilian assets? L.A time claims that IRGC has close to $65 billion asset just in hard currency.

Look at the pics from Ajads victory speech- few women, no kids or elderly, lots of military aged men. 1. it was a staged demonstration 2. put on the uniform and you have 10,000 troops in Tehran.
 
 
This is how Times analyses the next four years.

 Commentary: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's hold on power is weak 

 
15 June [Times] o one seriously doubted that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his hardline supporters in the Iranian regime had the muscle needed to hold on to power  with or without a fresh mandate from the countrys voters.

But keeping it for the next four years in the face of a powerful opposition movement could be much harder.

Iran may be entering one of its most dangerous and unstable periods since the revolution 30 years ago, with reformists and hardliners within the regime in open conflict.

Since he came to power in 2005, the Iranian President has strengthened key alliances in the Islamic Republic and consolidated his control over the State. With the tacit backing of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Mr Ahmadinejad increased the power of the Revolutionary Guards  the shock troops of the revolution  and the Basij, a paramilitary force with members in every corner of the country......

But as the demonstrations over the weekend showed, Iran is not a stalinist dictatorship. Trying to rule exclusively by force is not feasible over an extended period.

For a start, Iran is now part of the global community. People have mobile phones, access to the internet and satellite television. The state monopoly over the media has been broken and young Iranians are better informed than ever before about what happens in their country and better able to communicate with one another.

Then there is Irans unique constitution, which was deliberately created to avoid the rise of a new shah.....

Keeping a lid on this dissent will be a huge challenge for Mr Ahmadinejad, not to mention the looming showdown with the West over Irans nuclear programme, which will come to a head by the end of the year.
 
 
 
It's almost as if the Ayatollahs are going out of their way to make sure the election is illegitimate, which they have never done before. And to top it off, the post of President isn't really significant when you consider that the Supreme Ayatollah runs the show.

IMO, it was rigged and he may remain in office but I dont think this is over yet because it seems the people feel strongly that the election was rigged. Will they fight to remove him seems to be the logical question to ask dispite the guards and their actions.

 Iran's Supreme Leader orders election inquiry as opposition defies rally ban 

 
15 June [Times] Iran's Supreme Leader has ordered an investigation into the disputed re-election of President Ahmadinejad, reversing his earlier decree that the result was fair.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's intervention came as Iran braced itself for a third day of street protests by reformists, who claim that official voting figures giving Mr Ahmadinejad 63 per cent in last Friday's election were rigged, and a "charade".

Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the final say on all strategic matters, had described the result as fair and urged the country to unite behind Mr Ahmadinejad.

Today it emerged, however, that he had met the defeated opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi last night and ordered the powerful Guardians Council to examine his allegations of vote-rigging....

A clampdown on the protests escalated today when the authorities attempted to ban a nationwide march by Mousavi supporters.

Mr Mousavi's campaign website said that he will appear at the rally today despite the ban, and issue a plea for calm. The Interior Ministry warned that if Mr Mousavi did go ahead with his rally despite the ban, "the consequences of such behaviour will be directed at Mousavi", according to the IRNA state news agency.

Mr Mousavi has also threatened to embarrass the authorities by holding a sit-in protest at the mausoleum of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the deeply revered founder of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, daring them to risk clashes at the hallowed site....
 
 
 
 
IMO, it was rigged and he may remain in office but I dont think this is over yet because it seems the people feel strongly that the election was rigged. Will they fight to remove him seems to be the logical question to ask dispite the guards and their actions.

 

It was rigged BIG time ///

It is like Jimmy Carter scoring 75% popular vote against Reagan, in the political atmoshpere of early 80s.

Come one Obama, show some support...
 
 
Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the final say on all strategic matters, had described the result as fair and urged the country to unite behind Mr Ahmadinejad.

Yeah, I'm sure he will make sure the vote was fair.    
What a ****ing joke as far as a countires leadership goes. Like anybody would believe for a moment that the standard is going to change. Well, If he remains in office IMO the people can look forward to confrontation and a piss poor economy for a long time to come.:(

Actually, that is best time for Israelis.

They always see things in short term, not long term. So they dont really give a **** if say Iran will go through revolution that will benefit them (Israeli) in the long term and maybe establish democracy in that nation.

Their typical knee-jerk reaction would be drop bombs and worry later. I suspect it would be the U.S. that would be holding them back.
 
 
I heard reports that some of these riot police that were taken by the People, are actually Arabs and dont even speak Persian. Some of them even come from as far as Venezula.

Who knows, maybe, Chavez has Iranians in his riot police.

Its like the Romans who used captured Germans to fight against Persians, and captured Easterners to fight against the Germans.
 
 
 
See a few posts above, the Ayyatollah has reversed his decree that it was fair.

 

If you think for a moment that he will let any true reformer into office you are kidding yourself. The greatest lesson the Iranian people can learn from this is the seperation of church and state. Not the "theocracy" running the country because they will never let their grip slip on the people. The silver lining to all of this is now the "theocracy" have pretty much lost public support and the people will view countries that support this in the very same light. Dictators.
 
 
Iran's Interior Ministry announced Saturday that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had won 63.29% of the vote in the country's presidential election — a landslide. But Iran's opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi says he won and that the result had been rigged; Mousavi supporters have taken to the streets in Tehran and other cities to protest the official outcome.

Ahmadinejad, for his part, insists that he won fairly, while Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, initially congratulated Iranians for proving their "great worth." The result, Khamenei said, was a "divine assessment." On Monday, though, Khamenei ordered the powerful Guardian Council to investigate the fraud allegations.

So far, Washington has taken a cautious approach to commenting on the election, though a senior U.S. official called the results "not credible" and Vice President Joe Biden told Meet the Press that "there's some real doubt" whether Ahmadinejad actually won. "There's an awful lot of questions about how this election was run," he said. Here are five key questions being raised about the legitimacy of the results.

*IMO, Its safe to say that the likliness of A-Jad winning fairly is not even worth an answer. His opponent garners the womens votes and the younger 20+ Iranian youth votes but yet he only produces 33% and Ajad produces 63% while running his country into poverty, unemployment sky rocketing, calling for war?

The result, Khamenei said, was a "divine assessment" ?    

Heres my "divine assesment" they wouldnt know fair elections if they were beaten to death with them. Hows about we just ask all of the good Iranians to leave the country for a few weeks while we nuke these dumb asses, their firery rhetoric, voter fraud and twisted ruling theocracy back to the ****ing stone age. Let the place cool off and have the real Iranians return and conduct independently monitored transparent elections because it is quite obvious they will never get them any way else outside of a coup or civil war again the gaurds and theocracy. The U.N. should refuse to recognize Iran until independant transparent elections take place.
 
 
 
Actually, that is best time for Israelis.

They always see things in short term, not long term. So they dont really give a **** if say Iran will go through revolution that will benefit them (Israeli) in the long term and maybe establish democracy in that nation.

Their typical knee-jerk reaction would be drop bombs and worry later. I suspect it would be the U.S. that would be holding them back.

 

Now, I don't know if that is fair.

Regardless, even if you think the Israelis are evil, at least concede them they are not so stupid.

I think what we are witnessing could easily bring down the regime. If that happens, and from the Israelis perspective, it would therefore likely deactivate this completely artificial state of confrontation between the two countries.

In my opinion the Israelis would be craving with all their hearts that a free, democratic and pluralistic Iran comes out of this.

And so do I

It was rigged BIG time ///

It is like Jimmy Carter scoring 75% popular vote against Reagan, in the political atmoshpere of early 80s.

Come one Obama, show some support...

 

I was just about to ask how Obama should react to this situation. He has always stated that we should engage in talks with our opponents/adversaries. The conservatives have always ridiculed that policy as legitimizing tyrants. My question is who he should talk to now? If Obama talks with Mahmoud, doesn't that legitimizes the election result? If he talks with the opposition, doesn't that mean he's NOT talking to our opponent?

Xerxes,
IMHO B.Obama is doing the right thing with not supporting the opposition. One hint of support from him and regime will claim Mousavi is Collaborating with US, thus a treason. Mousavi might even end up dangling from a lamp post in very short period of time.
Considering the situation in Iran I think it is better for US & Israel to stay out this, unless absolutely vital to take action.
 
 
 
What makes you think the contrary? Because the White house spokesperson said so ?

 

I said it already. Three weeks ago I read an article by David Horovitz from the Jerusalem Post (a very sensible and intelligent analyst IMO) and he explained that in conversations with people who know the inner workings of the regime they thought that:

1- Votes would be counted by Khameini, no matter what the people had vote.

2- Khameini would hand the victory to A-Jad

I couldn't be sure then, and I can't even be sure even now, however:

- Read Aryajet comments, he points to suspicious signs

- Once we see the results, we can see that there has been a 12 point increase in participation compared to 2005. Ask yourself, what is more likely?:

That all this new people who voted were just thrilled with the wise and resolute A-jad leadership and handed him a landslide victory

OR...

That this regime should tell a lie

This has all the hallmarks of massive fraud. But the regime might have overplayed its hand, you can't insult people like that and expect to get away scot free.

I notice you haven't stated your reasons why you believe this results to be legitimate - and I can see why. We all know that pointing to the "election" "results" is a complete joke.

Its a dam shame the Iranian people cannot get fair and honest elections. Its quite obvious that the election was rigged. What is amazing is the turnout of people in the streets and the way the government is trying to silence them through violence. If A-jad and his master were that confident that the elections were not fraud then why not let the people have their say (it is after all your god given rights as a human being). It seems they didnt riot nor bother anybody until the police on motorcycles started the violence and the people just reacted to that. That just goes to show you the caliber of men that run your country. Sooner or later the people are going to have enough and every election they loose through fraud will only make them that much smarter for the next time. Learn to use the tools that modern times affords you such as internet that cannot be jammed or shut down and continue to communicate to the people. Their (A-jad and friends) biggest fear is the people showing the outside world how much of a fraud the present government really is. I sincerely hope someone produces undisputable evidence that its fraud (we pretty much expected) and shows it to the world for all to see.
 
 
Considering that the stakes have been raised with hundreds of thousands of protesters in Tehran alone, I don't think that Khameini can resolve the situation with even a Tienanmen style crackdown now.

Just insist on talking only to Khameini from now on.

Agreed, and IMO have the U.N. fail to recognize any Iranian council member until this is resolved including A-jad. The world tires of his lies and rhetoric.

I feel as though I am viewing and reading something from the Dark Ages.
 
 
 
Look at the pics from Ajads victory speech - few women, no kids or elderly, lots of military aged men. 1. it was a staged demonstration 2. put on the uniform and you have 10,000 troops in Tehran.

 The Daily Dish | By Andrew Sullivan 

 Faulty Election Data - tehranbureau 

 
The best evidence for the validity of the arguments of the three opponents of the President for rejecting the results declared by the Interior Ministry is the data the Ministry itself has issued. In the chart below, compiled based on the data released by the Ministry and announced by Irans national television, a perfect linear relation between the votes received by the President and Mir Hossein Mousavi has been maintained, and the Presidents vote is always half of the Presidents. The vertical axis (y) shows Mr. Mousavis votes, and the horizontal (x) the Presidents. R^2 shows the correlation coefficient: the closer it is to 1.0, the more perfect is the fit, and it is 0.9995, as close to 1.0 as possible for any type of data.

Statistically and mathematically, it is impossible to maintain such perfect linear relations between the votes of any two candidates in any election  and at all stages of vote counting. This is particularly true about Iran, a large country with a variety of ethnic groups who usually vote for a candidate who is ethnically one of their own. For example, in the present elections, Mr. Mousavi is an Azeri and speaks Turkish. The Azeries make up 1/4 of all the eligible voters in Iran and in his trips to Azerbaijan province, where most of the Azeri population lives, Mr. Mousavi had been greeted by huge rallies in support of his campaign. Likewise, Mr. Karroubi, the other reformist candidate, is a Lor. But according to the data released by Irans Interior Ministry, in both cases, Mr. Ahmadinejad has far outdone both candidates in their own provinces of birth and among their own ethnic populations.

 Iran's Disputed Election - The Big Picture - Boston.com 
 
 
 
What makes you think the contrary? Because the White house spokesperson said so ?

 

I don't even know what W.H spokesperson has said, but I'll add 1 more to my own reasoning.
It is civil right of any society to question legitimacy of certain election and it is the duty of electoral process conducting body to provide evidence for clarification.
If this victory was so swift and undeniable then IRI must have plenty of evidence to prove it beyond any doubt, but instead they diploid riot police and paramilitaries armed with baton, daggers, teargas, grenades and Uzis.
Another point:
According to IRI constitution this how an election results should be handled (not so in detail though). Ministry of Interior collects all sealed ballot boxes and counting starts immediately.
Final results after thorough counting will be published to public and then transferred to Guardian Council and will be held in there for minimum of 3 days. This period will used to review the possible complaint from loosing candidates and/or any "Irregularities", after that the results will be transferred to office of Supreme Leader for final endorsement of "His Highness". Then the presidency of a person is official.
This the time between Ministry Interior publishing the results and Khamenei endorsing them was less than an hour, some thing unprecedented in past 30 years. This clumsy work was actually the first factor for Iranians to start smelling the rat.
They cheated big time and got caught with their hands in cookie jar.

Yeah, they should leave a crowd alone to burn the entire city, not just several buildings.

Looking at the ugly situation in "color revolutions" countries, I really hope Iranians are smarter, and can handle elections without destroing their state. :(
 
 
 
I heard reports that some of these riot police that were taken by the People, are actually Arabs and dont even speak Persian. Some of them even come from as far as Venezula.

Who knows, maybe, Chavez has Iranians in his riot police.

Its like the Romans who used captured Germans to fight against Persians, and captured Easterners to fight against the Germans.

 

I am hearing reports of Arabs as well, presumably Hezzbollah troops. I don't put much credence in it.
 
 
 
Z,
Where is the picture? thanx

 

See many women, kids or elderly? These guys are all Guards or Basiji which means A-jad has tens of thousands of troops in Tehran who need only put on the uniform and pick up their guns.

 

 

 
 
 
I don't quite understand so much passion for Musavi. The guy is more conservative than Khatami and he's supported by the second most powerful character of the regime no less, Ali Rafsandjani, who is, if you have a look at his bio, a sick bastard. Musavi was in charge as Prime Minister during the darkest hour of the regime when thousands of students got executed...Thats not a colour revolution in any way, more like two sharks fighting for power by proxies...

Concerning the votes, well there were most certainly massive frauds, but saying Musavi won...no one has any proof of that yet.

Aryajet, correct me if I am wrong...

I was kid when Mossavi was premier so what I know is what others know.

The impression that I have of him is the following: i know that he is widely respected for his integrity and the economic manamement that he brought while he was premier (during the war). I see him as an Zhou En-lai. Someone who is dedicated to his work, and did his very best, not for himself, but genuinly for the cause that he believed in. I dont really care if he was the premier under Islamic Republic. What I can with relate with him, is his personality.

I think Amir-Abbas Hoveida, Musavi, Zhou En-lai all have the same hard-working, dedicated personalities. Though, the regimes that they have served may have been a bit shaky.

If the people of Iran can force the Guards to back down and the Supreme leader to validate their will that is a huge victory for liberty in Iran. Who the figure heads won't matter near as much as the fact that an Iranian voice not controlled by the clerics or Guards (the peoples collective voice) had its say. The hardliners already do a delicate dance with the reformist on certain social issues. This will shift the balance more to the liberal side of the spectrum. It will also empower the same hardliners, but those of them who think the Guards have too much power in their efforts to reduce that organization. If A-jad is declared defeated the Guards and Basiji are going to stink like the brown stuff and the Supreme leader will have the mandate to reduce/reform them.

But I don't see that happening. What's the regime gonna say now? "Oooops, sorry, we got it all mixed up, actually, it was Musavi who had 62% and A-jad 33%"

It is no longer a presidency "election". It is the legitimacy of the regime itself that is at stake.

And whatever they do now, they are screwed.

 Activists Launch Hack Attacks on Tehran Regime | Danger Room | Wired.com 

 
In both Iran and abroad, the cyberstrikes are being praised as a way to hit back against a regime that so blatantly engaged in voter fraud. But some observers warn that the network strikes could backfire  hurting the very protesters theyre meant to assist. Michael Roston is concerned that it helps to excuse the Iranian regimes own cyberwarfare. Text-messaging networks and key opposition websites mysteriously went dark just before the election. Morozov worries that it gives [the] hard-line government another reason to suspect foreign intervention  albeit via computer networks  into Iranian politics.

Iran has one of the worlds most vibrant social media communities. Thats helping those of us outside Iran follow along as this revolution is being YouTubed, blogged, and Tweeted. But Irans network infrastructure there is relatively centralized. Which makes Internet access there inherently unstable. Programmer Robert Synott worries that if outside protesters pour too much DDOS traffic into Iran, carriers there will simply pull the plug to protect the rest of their network.

Step 1- scape goat the "culprits" probably elements of the IRGC to create distance between the clerical regime and the election results and jump infront of the reform movement to steer it towards reducing the Guards.

Step 2- new elections with the desired result of a reformist cleric as president.

Step 3- break the Guards and basiji.

 Gunfire as Iran gripped by greatest protest since Islamic revolution 

 
Hundreds of thousands of protesters poured on to the streets of Tehran on Monday in the greatest display of popular feeling since the Islamic revolution in 1979.

16 June [Telegraph] To cries of "death to the dictator", Iranians protested against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's proclaimed re-election, in a demonstration that passed largely unopposed by the authorities.

The rally, larger than anything seen in the capital since the demonstrations that toppled Shah Reza Pahlavi 30 years ago, openly defied the authorities. The interior ministry banned the rally and warned protesters that live ammunition could be used against them.

At the end of the demonstration gunfire broke out during at least one clash between protesters and a pro-government militia. One protester was killed and several were injured.....
 
 
 
Even the Supreme Leader cannot dismiss the ground swell against the announced poll results.

 Ayatollah Ali Khamenei surprises many with fraud inquiry into poll 

 
16 June [Times] News that the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has instructed the Guardian Council  the legal body which is required by the Constitution to ratify the election result  to investigate charges of fraud has come as a surprise to many who took for granted the rhetoric of absolute power that emanates from the Leaders office.

Few believed that the Supreme Leader, who had somewhat prematurely congratulated the President-elect on Saturday (the Constitution requires a three-day waiting period so that any complaints can be lodged) would shift his position so quickly.

Yet it is testament to the tremendous pressures on the political system that have resulted from the outpouring of anger across the country, and the widespread belief that the political order is experiencing a serious crisis of authority.....

As Ayatollah Khamenei moved swiftly to confirm the vote in enthusiastic terms, President-elect Ahmadinejad dismissed the protests as nothing more than the discontent one might expect from disappointed football fans.

Such condescension only fuelled the anger that had erupted on Saturday. Indeed, it would appear that Mr Ahmadinejads comment that there had been no formal complaints about the election was pivotal in raising the stakes in the cycle of demonstrations which were gripping the country.

This dismissive gesture prompted one of the three defeated candidates, the influential former commander of the Revolutionary Guards, Mohsen Rezai, to publish a formal letter of complaint. What was important about this intervention was not only Mr Rezais conservative political leanings but that he made it quite clear that he felt he was several million votes short. In other words, his was not a procedural complaint but a substantive one......
 
 
 
The police have failed to contain the riots, even the Hezbollah fighters employed by the regime (so many reports of Arabic speakers it is beginning to seem cedible) that the Basiji has been called in and the gloves are off, no more bars, bats and batons now its time for parabellum.

This was what exactly he said in his speech after endorsing the election finally, "The outcome of this election is another will of allah which we have witnessed time and time gain in past 30 years". Now the will of allah is being investigated.:D:D

Former Mossad Chief Ephraim Halevy told Time magazine in an interview published Thursday that an Israeli attack on Iran "could have an impact on us for the next 100 years" and should only be considered as a last resort.

I think your observation is probably the wished for option.

I don't think so many people would be willing to demonise Iran, if they knew the level of, and active dissent against the current govt.

If anything such an incredibly lopsided result MUST be rigged. Which has repercussions. It must have factored into the Ayatollah's reassessment.

I think he is a Hawk, but a similar happening occurred during the revolution - where popular action carried the day seperately from belief the Ayatollah believed. I.E he wasn't initially supportive of the revolution but then changed his mind given what had unfolded. In short, I believe he wants to control the future, just so long as he is in control of the future whatever course that takes.

The Gaurd is a law until itself however and has blood on it's hands.

Would you take your wife and kids if you lived in a place where there's a good chance the government might open fire?

Point taken Ben, and ofcoarse I would not but it does seem very peculiar that there is not a mixed age grouping of men for the number of men. They "seem" to be within a general age range of about 3-7 years. And other pictures of his opponent shown mixed ages and sex's with children and elderly. Doesnt that seem funny to you?

Would you take your wife and kids if you lived in a place where there's a good chance the government might open fire?

 

That was a pro-Ajad rally fully approved with official blessing. meanwhile on the other side, those protesting the election you see lots of women, elderly and even kids.
 
 
Apparently another huge rally has been taking place. The BBC says this might even be larger than the first. But since the mullahs have banned foreign journalists, they can't confirm it reliably.

One wonders how this is going to end. If the crowds get bigger and bigger, then it will be difficult for the clerics to control this.
 
 
'Mass opposition rally' in Tehran

Iranian opposition supporters are staging a mass rally in northern Tehran, witnesses have told the BBC.

It comes despite presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi urging supporters not to risk clashes with demonstrators backing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Hundreds of thousands turned up on Monday alleging fraud in the poll which returned Mr Ahmadinejad to office.

Tough new restrictions on the foreign media mean the BBC is unable to confirm reports of Tuesday's opposition rally.

The new restrictions have been imposed amid apparent surprise and concern among authorities at the scale of popular defiance over Friday's official election results.

Correspondents say crowds the size of those at Monday's opposition rally have not been seen in Tehran since the 1979 revolution.

An eyewitness told the BBC Tuesday's rally was even bigger than Monday's - though this cannot be independently confirmed.

It is being held in northern Tehran - an opposition stronghold.

Thousands of supporters of President Ahmadinejad staged their own rally in Vali Asr Square in central Tehran - some busses in from the provinces, correspondents say.

The latest opposition rally comes despite a Mousavi spokesman urging supporters not to take part in another demonstration on Tuesday, amid fears of new violence.

Hospital officials say eight people died in violence which erupted at the end of rally - which authorities blamed on "thugs".

These are comments from people in Iran writing in the "Have Your Say" section of the BBC site:

I just wanted to thank all the honest and kind people who are supprting the Iranian nation in it's fight for freedom and justice.
Thank you all

Ali, Tehran

Today Iranians taste the bitterness of tyranny and dictatorship more than ever.
This election is definitely infected by fraud.
There was unprecedented turn out just because many people hoped to get rid of Ahmadinejad.
The world must know the result is not what Iranians wanted.
Meanwhile this morning the BBC is suddenly blocked!:S I'm accessing this page via a proxy.

Arya Diba, Tehran, Iran

I am iranian,i know what exactly happend.
There was 2 kind of cheating.
1.Mr.ahmadinejad paid or maid people in rural areas to vote for him,there is no doubt.
And because 30% of irans population are living in rural areas he won.
2.in this election people attendence was about 80%,in the previous election it was 35%,why?
Because many people here hate ahmadinjad and they went to vote for mr.mousavi.but it seems like that they have counted mr.mousavis ballots for mr.ahmadinjad.

Hamid, Yazd,iran

Somebody down here commented on how the Pakistanis and other are supporting Ahmadinedjad. Iranians have nothing in common with the Arab fundamentalism. Iranians have different culture, different people. Our women fight in the streets like you see in the movies published in BBC. We will rather die that to live under a government that promoted a fake election. We have nothing to do with you who promote hate in the name of Allah.

Nazeri, Tehran

Please post my comment. The election has been massively rigged by the ruling government. all the people voted for reformists. They wrote Mousavi on the ballots but the authorities read the ballots Ahmadinejad. A velvet coup is going on. Text message service is not working, internet is disconected in some cities, anti-riot police is battering people with batons, and most probably Karoubi and Mousavi are under home arrest. Please reflect what is going on in the streets of Tehran.

Morteza, shiraz

There is a consensus that elections here were rigged and this is would be the first phase of a coup by IRGC. Bloody purges are b underway. please support the iranian people in ayway you can.
We need your help now more than ever.

Ali, Tehran

The greatest cheat in the world history!
All my friends, family, colleague, and everybody that I knew voted for Mossavi, because we wanted to vote foe CHANGE.

Omid, Iran

Whoever claims the voters turnout at the polling stations were to support IRAN's gov, is lying. People wanted a change. They mostly loath Ahmadinejad and turnout was to make sure he does not win to ruin the country for another four years.

And the official announcement has stunned every single Iranian I know.

Samira Kashani, Tehran

Hey world! this is NOT our president. we want you all to know, don't call him President, don't let him come to your country, don't invite him to meetings, here a Kudeta has happened by regime, here mas of fakes has happened in the election, the condition is extremely fragile and people are so angry.
Current situation in Iran on Saturday night: Cell phone network is down. Facebook, Youtube, and news websites are censored (filtered) and police agents are beating people in streets.

Sirwan, Tehran

We have no doubt about the fraud in elections, most educated and mid-social level families have voted for change, Mir Hossain Mousavi was not the goal but he was just a tool for expression of believes and aspirations.
people here wanted change; change in the way of governing country, change in foreign policy, change in economic system and change in political structure of the country.
people here had to protest, because there is no other civilized way of request and aspiration expressing.

Sirwan, Tehran

My name is mehdi from iran
I want the world and international community know that, that was a BIG CHEAT.
We don't elect ahmadinejad, he elected by himself.
If you was here you will see the confused people who just think of crying.
World have to know that Ahmadinejd is not our elected president.
We've elected Mousavi.
That just was a movie to show the world that how Iranian peoples love their leader and regime.
Even in my little city we saw the SWAT to control the crowd

Mahdi, khorasan

I'm so angry about this election,and really I'm not able to explain my sadness about what happened in my country, Pray for us please! Goodbye Freedom & Human Rights... Hello Jail And Execution !!!!

Mehdi

Enough is enough! we want our country back! Ahmadinejad lost the election. BBC must have the courage to tell the truth!

Muhammed Aghili, Shahrekord,Iran

No way Ahmadinejad won this election by a "landslide".They announced him the "winner"even before the enitre votes were counted.How can you hand count all these millions of votes by hand?Simply impossible.Mousavi is the real President.Khamanei would be wise to call for a recount,or else the entire Islamci Republic is in jeopardy.

Dore, Velenjak,North Tehran,Iran

i am really sorry for myself as iranian
all this election was a big cheating & we were really fool that took part in that election they abused the crowd to show that all people want the same thing as before but it was really opposit.

To all free people,

We don't have any kind of communication devices. we cant text to each other, we can't call each other, internet connections are either disconnected or extremely slow! Don't all of these have any meaning? We just want European countries not to accept Ahmadinejad's election.

United Nations has to come to the game, please don't leave us alone, now it is the time for you to come and help us. We have the courage and motivation to do anything to kick this guy out...

Mahsa, Tehran

My family and I voted to mousavi, and I am sure that most majority of Iranian did the same. You watch TV and see how Ahmadi nejad gunmen hit people. They attack and hit Iranian (however they are Iranian too),let alone if they reach nuclear weapon you guess what they will do to the world. Please help us. Please help us to get rid of them. UN must help us

laleh, tehran

With special regards

I am one of the people of Iran
First I want to thank you because of reflecting the news of Tehran

I want to ask you to reflect the events of these days in all around Iran More powerful than what you did in last days.
This is obvious that there was a BIG fraud in the presidential election in Iran.
In this condition we expect from international media to reflect the suffering of the people of Iran like a mirror.

tehran iran, tehran, Iran

If the Iranian regime is so sure that there was no fraud, why don't they produce the votes that Ahmadinejad got for inspection or accept an audit? Why do they forbid monitors? Instead they are beating up anyone and everyone who asks any related questions. No honest person would feel the need to react in such a manner!

Amir, Tehran

I am a sharif student in Tehran, I voted for Musavi along with nearly all people I know closley. a lot of people say they voted for Musavi and some people says there are some people in the interior ministry who know that Musavi has won the election with more than 19 milion votes.
there has been a condition since saturday here that looks like a real coup, the riot polis is on patrol in large number in the streets of Tehran dispersing any gathering. there has been harsh attacks to Dorms by Basij

Mani Irannejad, Tehran

The Pro Ahmadinejad people on the streets supporting his victory are not from the capital or major towns, they are brought in from more rural parts of the country where he has more support.... As Its an organized process, it dose not requires much notice for the elements of the state to join the gatherings in minimal time This practice happens often in Iran to glamorize Sate events and celebrations! its a motion that is used to maximize the national support in front of int'l & local cameras

 US asks Twitter to stay online because of Iran vote - Yahoo! Canada News 

NEW YORK (AFP) - The Obama administration took the unusual step of asking Twitter to delay a planned maintenance outage because of the social blogging site's use as a communications tool by Iranians following their disputed election, a senior official said Tuesday.

ADVERTISEMENT

The request highlighted the administration's Web-savvy ways and the power of social networks such as Twitter and Facebook in organizing protests over the election results in the face of a ban by Iranian authorities on other media.

But it also seemed to run counter to President Barack Obama's public efforts not to appear to be meddling in Iran's internal affairs.

Twitter delayed Monday's scheduled tuneup, which would have taken place during daylight hours in Iran, and rescheduled it for Tuesday. The site went down around 5:00 pm (2100 GMT) for what was expected to be about an hour.

A State Department official in Washington said Twitter had been asked to delay Monday's shutdown because the micro-blogging service was being used as "an important means of communications" in Iran.

The official told reporters on condition of anonymity that Twitter was all the more important because the Iranian government had shut down other websites, cell phones, and newspapers.

"One of the areas where people are able to get out the word is through Twitter," the official said. "They announced they were going to shut down their system for maintenance and we asked them not to."

The US official said he did not know who at the State Department called Twitter but it was not Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said in a blog post that Twitter had delayed plans to temporarily shut down the service for "critical" maintenance but did not mention any State Department intervention.

Another Twitter co-founder, Jack Dorsey, speaking at a two-day conference in New York on Tuesday about the micro-blogging service, did not mention the State Department request but said Twitter was "delaying much overdue scheduled downtime so we would not interrupt what's currently unfolding in Iran."

Dorsey described the usage of Twitter by Iranians as "amazing."

"Just think about what's occurring over there and the accessibility that we all have to see this unfold in real time," he said. "It's amazing. It's huge."

"Suddenly everything that's happening over there feels extremely close," he said. "It feels approachable. And that's really important and that is really the greatest success of what Twitter is."

"If ever there was a time that Twitter mattered it was this past weekend in Iran," added Jeff Pulver, organizer of the 140 Character Conference.

Protestors in Iran on Monday used Twitter for battle cries and to spread word about clashes with police and hardline supporters of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Messages posted on the micro-blogging service, some with links to pictures, streamed from Iran despite reported efforts by authorities there to block news of protests over Ahmadinejad's claim of having been fairly re-elected.

Pictures of wounded or dead people that senders claim were Iranian protestors ricocheted about Twitter and wound up posted at online photo-sharing websites such as Flickr as well as on YouTube.

State Department spokesman Ian Kelly told reporters that officials at the State Department had been in contact with Twitter throughout the weekend, but did not make clear that it was about the aftermath of the Iranian elections.

When asked if such talks with Twitter could be seen as interference in Iran's affairs, he said Obama and other officials were very clear they want to stay out of Iranian politics.

"We don't want to be seen as interfering," he said.

Obama himself issued the same message Tuesday, saying, "It is not productive, given the history of US-Iranian relations to be seen as meddling -- the US president, meddling in Iranian elections."

Kelly went on to say that the new media provided a good source of information for the US government, which has had no diplomatic relations with Iran for three decades.

"We're of course monitoring the situation through a number of different media, including social media networks like Facebook and Twitter," Kelly said
 
 
If twitter had gone down, it might have inflamed things more because the street would have blamed the regime. Or the regime would have blamed the Americans for causing the outage so the regime would be blamed. Keeping the network up simply keeps America out of the situation.
 
 
He gets the respect from the people of many lands for holding on to this stand.

 Iran election: Barack Obama refuses to 'meddle' over protests 

 
17 June [Telegraph] Barack Obama, the US President, is refusing to 'meddle' in the disputed Iranian elections, despite mass protests over the result which returned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power.....
 
 
 
The regime is doing his utmost to censor all informations available about the protests currently happening in Iran. But according to witnesses inside the pro Ahmadinedjad rally the demonstrations numbered no more than a few thousands...Ahmadinedjad looks completely discredited. Even if we don't know the results of the elections. I think it goes far beyond who really won friday....

Aryajet and Castellano are right I guess Musavi (even if he's part of the nomenklatura) is the troyan horse that confronts the Islamic Repbulic to its lies and its thuggish attempts to repress any dissents. I think lots of Iranians are not cynical about the Islamic Republic and genuinely think they live in some sort of democracy hence their violent reactions.

Hundreds of thousands of people continue to demonstrate daily in the streets I think its time for Sarkozy, Obama and the others to publicly denounce the regime and offer their support to the Iranian youth.

The problem is that they are still disorganized, and the regime keeps the upper hand in this confrontation.
 
 
This is one way the Internet is getting nearly real-time information out of Iran.

 Twitter Is a Player In Iran's Drama 

 
17 June [WashingtonPost] The State Department asked social-networking site Twitter to delay scheduled maintenance earlier this week to avoid disrupting communications among tech-savvy Iranian citizens as they took to the streets to protest Friday's reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The move illustrates the growing influence of online social-networking services as a communications media. Foreign news coverage of the unfolding drama, meanwhile, was limited by Iranian government restrictions barring journalists from "unauthorized" demonstrations.

"One of the areas where people are able to get out the word is through Twitter," a senior State Department official said in a conversation with reporters, on condition of anonymity. "They announced they were going to shut down their system for maintenance and we asked them not to."

A White House official said "this wasn't a directive from Secretary of State, but rather was a low-level contact from someone who often talks to Twitter staff." The official said Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted, according to news reports. "Twitter is simply a medium that all Iranians can use to communicate," the official said.....
 
 
 
 More pictures from today's protests. Big picture from Boston.com is an amazing feature 

Like Zraver said, not many women in Pro A'jad protests.

 I know this is offtopic, but I really have to say this - Iranian women are really pretty. 
 
 
 
If twitter had gone down, it might have inflamed things more because the street would have blamed the regime. Or the regime would have blamed the Americans for causing the outage so the regime would be blamed. Keeping the network up simply keeps America out of the situation.

 

*Its sad to think the people of Iran would actaully believe the shit that pours forth from this moonbats mouth. Completely sad to think we would have anything to do with their elections. We hope that they would have elected someone better or prove it was fraud but we all know how far this will go. Looks like we get to deal with this jerk off and his lies for the next few years. I hope the Iranian people take him out.

She is fugly compared to some. Most Americans will find Iranian women pretty. Culturally they have similar tastes as ours as regards beauty and they stem from the same Indo-Ayran branch of the human family that created the Western Europeans with the finely chiseled faces we make supermodels.

You take that back   else I will be protesting in Tehran demanding the Ayatollah issue a fatwa against you.

Well we aren't looking for miss universe here. That was just a random photo of a girl in a protest. If you can find a girl that pretty in a protest, imagine how many beautiful others one will find if you actually start looking for them. But yes, Iranian girls are generally very pretty. I have a friend from Iran (a girl) who is a statement to that  
 
 
Persian women are hot no doubt, but it's also widely known that Iranian women have a high rate of plastic surgery amongst them, compared to the world in general. I remember reading that somewhere. So that also might have something to do with it, perhaps
 
 
what???? iranian women have higer rate of pl. surgerys than americans??? not a chance.
 
 
I've been surfing alot on the elections this morning and it seems Irans government is now in fear. They know they got caught rigging the elections with more votes casted in certain areas then in some of the main populations. Voting places were closed early while people were still lining up to vote and they have defied the government by calling for more protests. Reporters forced to stay indoOrs so they cant report on the protests or leave the country. This is not government this is dictatorship and if you want it to change then sometimes you must fight!

To the people in IRAN......

GOOD FOR YOU LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD AND YOUR VOTES CAST. THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS YOU CAUGHT THEM CHEATING AND THEY ARE TRYING TO SILENCE YOU BY TELLING YOU TO RESPECT THE ISLAMIC STATE.

HOW CAN YOU RESPECT A GOVERNMENT THAT IS NOT RESPECTING YOU OR YOUR WISHES AND HIDES THIS FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD BY SHUTTING DOWN COMMUNICATIONS AND MAKING FOREIGN REPORTERS LEAVE THE COUNTRY OR STAY INDOORS.

KEEP PROTESTING AND FORCE A NEW ELECTION FROM THE THEOCRACY!

YOU HAVENT LOST YET !  

WOHOOO THE WAB REACHING OUT !
 
 
TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's opposition Wednesday pledged to continue protests over disputed presidential elections as authorities tightened controls on media, threatening Web sites reporting on the country's worst crisis for decades.

Al-Alam footage shows Ahmadinejad supporters rallying Tuesday in central Tehran.

Opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi, who claims last week's re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was rigged, called on his supporters to join him on the streets of Tehran Thursday in the latest in a series of demonstrations.

Meanwhile, the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard -- which enforces strict Islamic codes -- said it will prosecute Web sites it accuses of inciting riots, adding to a ban on foreign media reporting on the protests and a block on Internet site such as Facebook or Twitter.

Even as the Guard made its announcement, thousands of Iranians planned to head to Haft-e-Tir Square in central Tehran on Wednesday evening despite a stepped-up government crackdown that has seen people arrested across the country.

The scale of the protests, the worst seen in the country since a 1979 revolution overthrew its monarchy, Tuesday prompted Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has already endorsed Ahmadinejad's win, to appeal for calm, urging citizens to support the Islamic state.

His appeal came a day after at least seven people were killed during a pro-Moussavi demonstration in Tehran.

Moussavi, who has dismissed a move by Iran's Guardian Council election authority to hold a partial recount, Wednesday called on Iranians to "put on display all signs of mourning" to show sympathy for families of those killed.

Despite reported arrests across Iran, many protests pledged to continue defying government bans on their demonstration.

" We are fighting with our lives and the world is just watching," said Ali, a Tehran University student who did not want his full name used for safety reasons. "They see how the government is trying to silence us, how they are beating us -- but they don't come to our help. It's OK. We will succeed, even if we have to fight alone."

In Iran's southwestern city of Shiraz, 28-year-old hospital nurse Najmeh has also taken to the streets in mass demonstrations every day since Saturday, but says she is now too afraid to participate.

"The police are everywhere you look," she said. "They hurt and arrested so many people last night that one wants to go out."

U.S. President Barack Obama reiterated his "deep concerns" about the elections Tuesday but said: "My hope is that the Iranian people will take the right steps in order for them to be able to express their voices, express their aspirations."

European Union has also expressed concern about the use of force against protesters, but the countries have not dismissed the results outright.

On Tuesday night, riot police hauled demonstrators off to jail in Shiraz -- in some cases waiting outside hospital rooms while they were treated for injuries first -- according to hospital staff.

The government restricted access to news Web sites, such as CNN. It blocked social networking sites to prevent citizens from posting pictures of the protests.

And Tehran told reporters working for international news outlets, including CNN, they could not shoot footage of the protests. The government said it could not guarantee their safety.

"I do believe them because the militia, they don't care who you are. If they see a camera, you will be a target," said a CNN producer who is not being identified for safety reasons.

He was referring to the Basij, a volunteer paramilitary force that takes its orders from the Revolutionary Guard, and is suspected of being behind most of the violent acts.

The decision to ban international reporters from filming rallies was an apparent reaction to video showing violence at recent demonstrations in support of Moussavi.

The government has criticized some of that coverage and the images, describing them as biased.

Still, residents found ingenious ways to get their message to the outside world using proxy servers.

Their amateur videos and photographs began appearing on video-sharing sites, such as YouTube and CNN's iReport. iReport.com: On the ground in Iran

In most cases, the content was impossible to verify. Some were posted anonymously or through third parties. Others provided little information on where they were taken.

A video from Monday shot in Tehran showed a man firing repeatedly from a building rooftop, sending protesters scrambling for cover. Another showed demonstrators rushing through the crowd carrying an unconscious man, his shirt soaked red.

A still photograph showed five policemen stomping on a man while a woman in a black chador -- a full-length loose robe that women in Iran wear like a cloak -- screamed for them to stop.

"I have never seen anything like what we saw yesterday," said a man who sent in footage to iReport of a rally in Azadi, or Freedom, Square in central Tehran on Monday. "(The chants) were so loud, the building we were in was trembling."

Counter-demonstrations by Ahmadinejad backers have also drawn thousands, reflecting a deep fissure in the country. The protests have claimed at least seven lives.

Eighty-five percent of the country's 46 million eligible voters went to the polls on June 12 -- an unprecedented voter turnout.

The government declared Ahmadinejad the winner -- with 62.63 percent of the vote. Moussavi received 33.75 percent, surprising many experts who expected him to win.

* AND JUST THINK THESE VOTES AND A WINNER WAS ANNOUNCED WITHIN HOURS. OBVIOUSLY A RIGGED ELECTION BY THE THOCRACY AFRAID TO LOOSE THEIR GRIP ON THE PEOPLE !
 
 
 
what???? iranian women have higer rate of pl. surgerys than americans??? not a chance.

 

you just cant imagine how free minded they can be under their chador.

just any of us cant imagine     )
 
 
(CNN) -- With a recount announced for the Iranian election, and opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi demanding a fresh election, the political situation in Iran remains on a knife's edge.

We're witnessing the mobilizing power of anti-incumbent forces, particularly youth, who are fed up, and the role of technology in getting voters to the ballot boxes and out on the street.

The Iranian drama has upstaged the recent Lebanese elections in which the U.S.-backed, Sunni-led March 14 coalition won a resounding victory over the increasingly politically active Hezbollah.

Both events, however, point to setbacks for what many have perceived as a Shiite axis of Iran and Hezbollah to undermine American interests throughout the Mideast. For this reason, Arab publics are fixated on the events in Tehran as much as Americans are.

Turkey appears to be the only country that has so far accepted the Iranian election results. The Obama administration, meanwhile, has clearly signaled that it considers the first-round results fraudulent, but has also praised the "vigorous debate" going on within Iran. This has so far proven to be an uncontroversial line.

In situations such as this, where events on the ground drive reality more than anything the United States can do, American policy-makers can only think in terms of possible scenarios and sensible reactions.

If the recount validates incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's victory, the most likely scenario, the United States will have to accept it but take comfort in the fact that even after the election is sorted out, the country's credibility will be weakened significantly. The clerics now face a semi-permanent crisis of legitimacy, both due to their over-interference in the election and the equally important issue of their uncertain succession.

Another scenario is that both the protests -- and the crackdowns -- intensify, leading to greater calls for some outside intervention. But any American involvement would be unwise, and would further legitimize Ahmadinejad's anti-American stance.

Recall that when the United States announced in 2007 that it would provide about $40 million for supporting democracy in Iran, the crackdown against dissidents and students only intensified. The same would happen again.

In all cases, the United States has to see how Ahmadinejad approaches the task of reconciling with the sizeable segments of the population that do not support him and are bruised by what they may forever consider a stolen election.

There is yet one more election that plays into the U.S. policy picture for the region, namely in Israel, where Benjamin Netanyahu was elected prime minister and just gave a major speech outlining conditional support for a "demilitarized" Palestinian state.

Could the United States use this as leverage with Arab regimes to deepen reconciliation with Israel and also further isolate Iran's opposition to a two-state solution? Maybe. For many, this would be an ideal outcome, but it depends very much on Netanyahu's sincerity.

Another issue that will return to the forefront after the election is Iran's nuclear program. While many Iranian voters have criticized the opaque way Ahmadinejad has handled the nuclear negotiations over the past several years, claiming it as one example of how he has tarnished Iran's international image, this does not necessarily mean that new leadership in Iran would no longer be interested in nuclear weapons. Here too, the United States will have to wait for signals from Iran.

The United States can be proactive on some levels, however. First, it can attempt to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations toward a two-state solution and actively lobby Arab governments to support a push toward settlement while Hezbollah is weakened and Iran is distracted.

Next, it can support a long-overdue regional security conference, likely convened by a Gulf Arab nation like Qatar, which enjoys solid diplomatic relations all around. The conference would include Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran and other participants to improve transparency over regional military maneuvering.

Such a grouping could also serve to stimulate more cross-border investment in the energy sector and job creation focused on the under-employed "youth bulge." The United States, EU, Russia and China should all quietly support such an event and attend as observers, while quietly urging the deepening of ties among these many historical antagonists.

Between the elections in Lebanon, Israel and Iran, and President Obama's speech in Egypt, it has clearly been an active spring and summer in the Mideast. Let's hope that the outcomes from all of these seminal events create the conditions for a new and more peaceful stage in the region.

AMEN TO THAT!

In the long run you can tie at most...so don't tell me you are Humphrey Bogart because even if you were which you are problably not...

THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL

 

IMO, They are. But so are many women of different cultures. Just going to the beach from where I am from will show you many different cultured women that come here to work for the summer. Some are students on visas working through college and some are new US citizens. There is something that can be said for variety...BEAUTIFUL!  

Just going to work everyday where I work is a virtual cutural shopping market and one can strain ones neck from observing some of these cultured beauties. All sizes, shapes, colors and cultures.   )
 
 
There is currently a big demonstration in the center of tehran. Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of people in the streets, whereas nothing was scheduled for today. That augurs well for tomorrow.

Good article, I disagree in a couple of secondary points but very good read and not as pessimistic as the title suggests:

 
Iran Fails Again
Melik Kaylan

One worries that the coup in Iran--for that is what it is--will not produce a life-affirming, decisive upsurge of popular revolt against the unshaven charlatans in charge. Iranian citizens have disappointed the rest of the world ad seriam in recent decades, and ultimately, tragically, one suspects they are not about to change their habits this time around.

Iran really is another civilization altogether, sui generis and oddly asymmetrical to other cultures. The Turks have lived beside them and with them--almost a third of Iranians are said to be ethnically Turkic--for millennia, not just in Turkey but throughout Central Asia, and even Turks don't understand Iran. What is one to make of a population that marched into martyrdom against the Shah and then against Saddam Hussein, yet has left the mullahs in place for 30 years?

The last time I visited Tehran (as opposed to other provinces) some six years ago I was charmed, like other Western visitors, by the highly cultivated good manners everywhere on display. I went for the Wall Street Journal to cover a cultural event and traveled in the guise of an ordinary tourist. It's easy to make friends with Iranians. Women walk up to you in the street to chat--an utterly unique experience in the Muslim world. Men quote poetry to each other. People newly met extend invitations to their homes and lives, and apparently into their thoughts. I had just visited another, more dangerous Muslim country for which I'd grown suitable facial hair. The reception girl at my hotel pointed to it and said, "It's not nice." From shopkeepers to restaurant waiters, one and all seemed to deplore the ukases of mullahs and basijis and kleptocrats. Yet they have ultimately allowed the likes of Khamenei, Rafsanjani, Khatami and Ahmadinejad to endure. While the pretend electorate let successive pretend governments persist in their mutual masquerade, the barely hidden deep state has dug ever deeper foundations of power.

Many have tried to push from within--trade unionists, students, journalists-- only to find themselves truncheoned down and buried away in the warren of secret gulags run by the various para-gendarmeries attached to real power. The Web site co-founded by Ramin Ahmadi (who has written for Forbes on the election), the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center offers a chilling anatomy of the entire complex. Yet none of the protest and sacrifice has reached critical mass. The regime has ingeniously tinkered with populist sentiment to keep it off the boil or to redirect it--from the Iran-Iraq war to the nuclear issue. Throughout, it has tried to present itself as an equal and opposite force to Israel, with the inbuilt message that Iran's regime is at least as legitimate as Israel's, therefore anyone undermining Iran is doing so not for Iran's faults but for Israel's sake. Most Iranians don't buy that any more than Soviet citizens ultimately bought the capitalist bogeyman as the cause of all their ills. Yet the Soviet police state collapsed while the hirsute police state of Iran endures.

One resorts to neologisms and euphemisms for the Iranian regime because Ahmadinejad's sustained presence in power has altered the regime's complexion--you can't quite call it a full-scale mullahcracy any longer. Indeed, several of the top mullahs now find themselves threatened by the very state they upheld, not least the former presidential mullahs Khatami and Rafsanjani, who supported Mousavi, the challenger to Ahmadinejad. Khatami and Rafsanjani, like Stalin's henchmen Kirov, Beria and the like, have found that dictatorships sooner or later consume their enforcers.

To be sure, the West has played its part, as it always does, with foreign policy blunders and live-and-let-live intellectual arguments. In the former category, one can point to a long list of wrong turns: the neglect of Afghanistan, which allowed Iran to consolidate influence over non-Sunni Afghans, thereby giving Tehran leverage over U.S. moves in Kabul; the unopposed resurgence of Russia in the Caucasus, which gave Moscow counter-leverage against the West in Iran; and the many misjudgments in Iraq, especially America's mishandling of relations with Turkey, a country which has always functioned as a counterweight to Persian power in the region.

In the latter category of intellectual offenders, one always finds the predictable host of what you might, at a stretch, call neo-Fabians after the British socialist movement--always more ingenious, more humanist-than-thou--who focus on Western polemical inconsistencies rather than a rogue regime's horrors. My colleague Reihan Salam in this section cites the example of Noah Feldman: "Last year, Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School with a longstanding interest in religion and public life, published a provocative book called The Fall and Rise of the Islamic State. Rather than condemn contemporary Islamist political movements outright, Feldman placed them in a broader historical context."

I might add the example of Reza Aslan, the highly presentable young operator (and author) of Iranian-American background upon whom our institutions--even the Daily Show--have showered legitimacy. Last week, Aslan was featured in a one-on-one interview with Vishakha Desai for an entire evening at New York's Asia Society, in which he rehearsed his usual list of provocative nostrums to the delight of the audience--that Iran is a real democracy whether we like it or not, that Islam has been living through a reformation for over a century, and so on. The first assertion I leave the reader to consider. The second, though, is worth a detour.

Aslan's argument on Islam's reformation can be found in many interviews published on the Web. Here's one from Los Angeles CityBeat, in which he asserts in his usual way that, contrary to Western assumptions, Islam's reformation is fully underway because Muslims have pushed aside priesthoods and institutions and turned directly to holy scripture to exercise individual conscience in the way that Martin Luther did.

You could equally argue that Muslims in recent years have largely done the opposite. Since the post-World War I collapse of the Ottoman caliphate ushered out the ulema, the Islamic order of official jurists who determined the correct interpretation of scripture for rulers and citizens alike, no such priestly institution has existed--except in Iran, which has invented an entirely new and comparable hierarchy with all those Ayatollahs and Hojatelislams codifying daily conduct according to holy text.

Furthermore, the standard ideology of most Sunni Islamists includes a program for resurrecting the Caliphate and its attendant priesthood. Finally, most Muslims don't read scripture directly, because the vast majority--Indonesians, Pakistanis, Malaysians etc.--don't understand Arabic. The Quran is meant to be God's word literally, and may not be understood except in the original. Most Muslims therefore have to trust the word of their Hoja, the Mosque preacher--exactly the condition of Christians before the Reformation. To be precise, and pace Aslan, Islam is undergoing a counter-reformation without having lived through a reformation. When will our bien pensant institutions resist the suave appeal of the "useful idiots" in our midst?

Meanwhile, Iranian citizens can help spur a true Reformation in Islam by sweeping away their turbaned and bearded tormentors back to the moderation of the cloister. They have the good taste, cultural depth and independence of mind to see the absurdity of their condition. Where is their collective courage? One might remind them (with a slight alteration) of Omar Khayyam's words: "Think, in this batter'd Caravanserai / Whose Doorways are alternate Night and Day / How Mullah after Mullah with his Pomp
Abode his Hour or two / and went his way."

I wish the good people of Iran the best of luck for change, where as I wish their present leader A-jad and accompanying Theocracy the noose for how they treat their people and cheat them of their ligitimate rights one of which being fair and transparent elections. I hope they over throw them all and rejoin the rest of the world in working for peace in the region and stability. We all want the very best for our countries and our families no reason it cannot be achieved.
 
 
Amen
 
 
Defying threats of arrest or worse, witnesses to protests in Iran are managing to leak reports of violence after the country's disputed presidential elections.

A protester injured during Monday's demonstration in Tehran is carried to a hospital.

"Censoring is very bad here and they have reduced Internet speed," two Iranians said to a friend outside the country. The pair wanted to broadcast images of damage and casualties after a reported attack on a dorm at the University of Tehran. "We managed to upload a few pictures and movies... please give it to news agencies and ask them to air it."

The witnesses said riot police and militia attacked the dormitory Sunday night after a student protest the day before. Up to 150 students were arrested, according to the account, and at least one was killed. Students were beaten and shot, and one of the buildings caught fire. Some university professors resigned after the incident, the witnesses said.

CNN cannot independently confirm this or other reports. The images showed a heavily damaged building, the charred remains of what appeared to be a dorm room, an injured or dead person, a burned motorcycle and a bloody floor.

Many Iranians feel the June 12 election was "a sham," a Tehran man in his 20s told CNN in an interview.

"During [the] previous presidential election, we had a 50.9 percent turnout," he said. "This time, we got 82 percent, because people wanted change and [current President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad out. We know that many of Ahmadinejad voters from [the] last election voted for [opposition leader Mir Hossein] Moussavi this time.

Are you in Iran? Share your story with CNN
"This is one of the reasons we were certain that Moussavi would win," he said. "On Saturday morning, when they released the results that Ahmadinejad got 64 percent and Moussavi got 33 percent, we were absolutely shocked. If you looked at the returns coming in, Ahmadinejad's returns never dipped -- but Moussavi's votes dropped from 630,000 to 570,000. How is that possible? It's just more proof that the elections were rigged... people feel like their intelligence has been insulted and that they've been lied to."

Reports of violence came from outside Tehran as well. One video was posted by a person who said he had received it anonymously from a Twitter feed. It showed several people wounded by apparent gunshots, and people attempting to treat them, seemingly without medical supplies. The poster said the video was shot in Esfahan, a city about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of Tehran.

"We need napkins, towels!" one person yells in the video. "Quick, give them to me!"

"Sit down, sit down," another person tells one of the injured. "Please relax. You are very hurt."

Another image on CNN's iReport site shows the body of a man who has suffered a huge gash to his side. The man was 25, the description said, and was martyred because of his belief in freedom. In yet another video, posted without a description, a screaming crowd surrounds a man's body. CNN is not identifying iReporters who post content from inside Iran.

"Iranian TV isn't giving the big picture," the Tehran man said. "They are depicting the protesters

What a wonderful government that attacks students in their dorms. Whats a matter couldnt find any elderly women and men to beat in the streets? The U.N. should refuse admission to Iran altogether and suspend any country that has dealings with this regime until a fair, transparent election can be held with idependent observers. That way the people get a fair shake.  
 
 
Why bother? Khameini and his minions are hanging themselves well enough. Never interrupt your enemy when he's making a mistake.
 
 
TEHRAN, Iran (June 17) - Iran accused the United States on Wednesday of "intolerable" meddling in its internal affairs, alleging for the first time that Washington has fueled a bitter postelection dispute. Opposition supporters marched in Tehran's streets for a third straight day to protest the outcome of the balloting.
The Iranian government summoned the Swiss ambassador, who represents U.S. interests in Iran, to complain about American interference, state-run Press TV reported.

EDITORS' NOTE: Reuters and other foreign media are subject to Iranian restrictions on their ability to report, film or take pictures in Tehran. A video grab from state television news network IRINN shows hundreds of supporters of defeated presidential candidate Mirhossein Mousavi gathering in Tehran June 17, 2009. Iranian reformist Mousavi called on Wednesday for a day of mourning for those killed in clashes set off by a disputed presidential election as tens of thousands protested for the fifth straight day.

The English-language channel quoted the government as calling Western interference "intolerable."
President Barack Obama has reacted cautiously to developments in Iran, saying he shared the world's "deep concerns about the election" but adding that it was "not productive, given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations, to be seen as meddling."
The two countries broke off diplomatic relations after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A crackdown on dissent continued, with more arrests of opposition figures reported, and the country's most powerful military force — the Revolutionary Guard — saying that Iranian Web sites and bloggers must remove any materials that "create tension" or face legal action.
Amateur video showed thousands of people marching on an overpass in Tehran in support of pro-reform candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi. He has accused the government of rigging the election in favor of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Marchers flashed the victory sign or carried placards, and some were dressed in green — the color of Mousavi's campaign.
It was the third day in a row that Mousavi supporters have taken to the streets, and he called for another demonstrations on Thursday — a direct challenge to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the cleric-led system.
Khamenei has told Mousavi to pursue his demands through the electoral system and called for Iranians to unite behind their Islamic government, an extraordinary appeal in response to tensions over the vote. But Mousavi appears unwilling to back down, issuing on his Web site a call for a mass demonstration Thursday.

"We want a peaceful rally to protest the unhealthy trend of the election and realize our goal of annulling the results," Mousavi said.
He called for his followers to wear or carry black in mourning for the alleged election fraud and the deaths of protesters, and said there should be "a new presidential election that will not repeat the shameful fraud from the previous election."
Mousavi and his supporters accuse the government of rigging the June 12 election to declare hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner. Their street protests, paired with dissent from powerful clerical and political figures, have presented one of the gravest threats to Iran's complex blend of democracy and religious authority since the system emerged from the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
In another high-profile display of apparent opposition support, several Iranian soccer players wore green wrist bands during a World Cup qualifying match in South Korea that was televised in Iran.
Mousavi's Web site said seven Iranian players wore the green bands in the first half of the game, although most were forced to take them off before the second half. It said Mehdi Mehdavi-Kia kept his green band on throughout the game, which Iran and South Korea drew 1-1.
Fans from Iran unfurled a banner in the stands that read "Go To Hell Dictator," and waved Iran's national flags emblazoned with the plea "Free Iran."
Blogs and Web sites such as Facebook and Twitter have been vital conduits for Iranians to inform the world about protests and violence.
The Web became more essential after the government barred foreign media Tuesday from leaving their offices to report on demonstrations on the streets of Tehran.
Mousavi condemned the government for blocking Web sites, saying the government did not tolerate the voice of the opposition.
The violence has left at least seven people dead, according to Iran's state media, although videos and photos posted by people inside Iran show scenes of violence that have not been reported through official channels. The new media restrictions make it virtually impossible to independently verify much of the information, which includes dramatic images of street clashes and wounded demonstrators.
Much of the imagery has been posted anonymously. In other cases, those who have posted have declined to be identified due to fear of government retaliation, or cannot be reached due to government restrictions on the Internet and mobile phones.
The Revolutionary Guard, an elite military force answering to Khamenei, said through the state news service that its investigators have taken action against "deviant news sites" that encouraged public disturbances. The Guard is a separate military with enormous domestic influence and control of Iran's most important defense programs. It is one of the key sources of power for the ruling establishment.

The statement alleged that dissident Web sites were backed by Canadian, U.S. and British interests, a frequent charge levied by hard-liners against the opposition.

"Legal action will be very strong and call on them to remove such materials," it said.
Iran's most senior dissident cleric, Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, said widespread vote fraud had undermined the legitimacy of the ruling Islamic system and that "no sound mind" would accept the results.

"A government that is based on intervening in (people's) vote has no political or religious legitimacy," said Montazeri, who had once been set to succeed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as supreme leader until he was ousted because of criticisms of the revolution.

State media said Khamenei would deliver the sermon at Friday prayers, the most important religious address of the week. The supreme leader generally leads Friday prayers only two or three times a year.
Unlike past student-led demonstrations, Mousavi has the ability to press his case with Iran's highest authorities and could gain powerful allies. Some influential clerics have expressed concern about possible election irregularities, and a fierce critic of Ahmadinejad, former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, is part of the ruling establishment.
Iranian TV showed pictures of Faezeh Hashemi, Rafsanjani's daughter, speaking to hundreds of Mousavi supporters, carrying pictures of Khomeini and others.

The U.S.-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said several dozen noted figures associated with the reform movement have been arrested, among them politicians, intellectuals, activists and journalists.
Analyst Saeed Leilaz, who is often quoted by Western media, was arrested Wednesday by plainclothes security officers at his home, said his wife, Sepehrnaz Panahi.
At least 10 Iranian journalists have been arrested since the election,

Reporters Without Borders said, and a Web site run by former Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi said the reformist had been arrested.
Prominent reformer Saeed Hajjarian has also been detained, Hajjarian's wife, Vajiheh Masousi, told The Associated Press. Hajjarian is a close aide to former President Mohammad Khatami.
The main electoral authority has said it was prepared to conduct a limited recount of ballots at sites where candidates claim irregularities. The recount would be overseen by the Guardian Council, an unelected body of 12 clerics and Islamic law experts close to Khamenei.

But Mousavi alleges the Guardian Council is not neutral and has already indicated it supports Ahmadinejad. Mousavi and the two other candidates who ran against Ahmadinejad are calling for an independent investigation.

His representative, reformist cleric Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour, said after a meeting with the council Tuesday the number of votes in counted in 70 districts was higher than the population in those districts. He also said many polling stations were closed sooner than scheduled on election night, while people were still lining up.

On Tuesday, the government organized a large rally in Tehran to show it too can bring supporters into the streets. Speakers urged Iranians to accept the results showing Ahmadinejad was re-elected in a landslide.
The appeal for unity failed to calm passions, and a large column of Mousavi supporters marched peacefully in north Tehran, according to amateur video.
Security forces did not interfere, a witness said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal.
Ahmadinejad, who has dismissed the unrest as little more than "passions after a soccer match," attended a summit Tuesday in Russia that was delayed a day by the unrest. He returned to Iran and held a cabinet meeting, saying on state television Wednesday that people had voted for his "policies of justice"

*IMO Amazing A-jad and his minions cant face the truth that the people dont want him as President and will go to any lengths to make sure the US,Canada and the Brits are responsible. I do hope the Iranian people are smarter then this and I hope they all sucseed in throwing his ass and his friends out of office. I think they have been blinded from reality long enough.

*By the way they left out the WAB as a dissident website.:P   )

Another view.....

 Douglas Bloomfield's column: I'm glad Ahmadinejad won | Columnists | Jerusalem Post 

I'm glad Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won reelection as Iran's president. And he did it by a single vote.

I was rooting for Ahmadinejad, the demagogic Holocaust denier who wants to wipe Israel off the map, because a victory by the relatively moderate Mir Hussein Mousavi could have created a dangerous complacency that would tempt some in the West to ease up on the pressure to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions, although there is no evidence his views on that are any different than Ahmadinejad's.

Any change brought by Mousavi's election as far as key foreign policy, security and nuclear issues would be more style than substance.

In Iran's version of democracy the principle of "one man, one vote" means that of the millions of people who went to the polls last week, only one man's vote really counted, and that was cast by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for his protégé, Ahmadinejad.

Khamenei and his circle of clerics handpicked all four candidates in last week's presidential election. Khamenei didn't even bother waiting for the votes to be counted before declaring his man had won a "sacred victory" by a landslide.

After a weekend of the largest and most violent demonstrations since the 1979 revolution, that saw Khamenei's religious police beat, gas and even shoot Mousavi's supporters, he promised to investigate possible election rigging.

But don't expect Mousavi, a longtime Khamenei rival, to get the new vote he wants, because the investigation will be conducted by the Guardian Council, which is headed by Ayatollah Ahmad Janneti, another prominent Ahmadinejad backer.

I'D LOVE to see a free and fair election in Iran, but until then I want Ahmadinejad to keep his job because he reminds us of the real threat posed by a regime that is intent on regional hegemony. With clients like Syria, Hizbullah, Hamas and other extremists, it threatens not only Israel but also American interests and Arab friends throughout the Middle East.

According to Mehdi Khalaji, an Iran expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Khameini's message in declaring Ahmadinejad the winner was to tell the West, "Iran is digging in on its nuclear program" and its backing of Hizbullah and Hamas.

Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg has written that moderate Arab leaders have told him they want Ahmadinejad to stay in power because "his rhetoric helps make their case that Iran is a danger to them." Israeli leaders fear losing the poster boy for their campaign to impress upon the world the urgent need to act before Iran actually goes nuclear.

Ahmadinejad didn't disappoint them; he immediately announced he would not moderate his views and any discussion of Iran's nuclear policy "belongs in the past." The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which has made Iran its top issue for more than 15 years, hopes rhetoric like that will make easier to win votes for legislation it is pushing to toughen sanctions by restricting Iran's ability to import and produce refined petroleum products, although evidence for the effectiveness of tough sanctions has been scanty.

Keith Weissman, an Iran expert, said the election "revealed some serious cracks" in Iranian government and even if Ahmadinejad remains in power he could be weakened.

There is only circumstantial evidence of fraud, and we may never know the truth because there were no international observers, Weissman said, but it is surprising that Ahmadinejad would win the home cities of all of his opponents.

President Barack Obama said Ahmadinejad's rhetoric may be "odious," but, to his credit, he hasn't given up on opening a dialogue with Teheran, telling reporters he plans to pursue "tough hard headed diplomacy, diplomacy without illusions." Jewish groups are not objecting - at least publicly - to the president's efforts, but many would like to see him set deadlines for diplomacy to produce results and to be prepared to take tougher measures should talks fail.

Iranian demonstrators demanding "reform" and "freedom" not only took to the streets to protest what they feel was a rigged election but they were Twittering, text messaging, sending pictures by cellphone, blogging and using the Internet to press their message. The government has tried to shut them down, and it has been cracking down on some foreign reporters.

There has been some speculation, but no evidence, that the mullahs fixed the election because they feared Obama's Cairo speech may have unleashed the kind of revolutionary fervor that they rode to power 30 years ago and don't wish to see replicated for their demise.

The dilemma for the Obama administration will be to pursue its diplomacy while still encouraging the obvious widespread dissatisfaction with the regime.

Few expect a repeat of the 1979 uprising just yet, but many are hoping this will sow seeds for future opposition. Could these demonstrations and calls for reform and freedom be the opening shots of a revolution that could bring democracy to Iran?

Inshallah.

It is a very cynical column but i disagree with your assessment.
 
 
Now you see why Obama reserved judgement. American support is seen as subservience in many parts of the world(but American money is accepted gladly and like Oliver Twist, they want more), so any form of support would have torpedoed the protests out of the water..Hmmmm.. Shrewd diplomat, Mr Obama is...  
 
 
 
I think a number of comments have been ungallant

Too right. I hope she comes and protests in my street. I will offer her political assyalum. Hmmm I could be onto something here.

Who told you they didn't drink? All hey have to do is go to the local Armenian Christian enclave and drink away. One of the main things smuggled from Irag to Iran is alcohol.
 
 
(CNN) -- For almost a week, tens of thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets in daily protests -- handkerchiefs shielding their faces from the pungency of tear gas, fists punching the air, and chants of "Down with the dictator" echoing against buildings.

Moussovi supporters rally Wednesday in Tehran, Iran. Released by Fars News Agency of Iran.

more photos » The massive outpouring is a result of a disputed presidential election that the protesters think coronated the incumbent hard-liner, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, over their candidate, Mir Hossain Moussavi.

Context can help put their grievances into perspective:

Q. The Iran that we know today is the result of the Islamic Revolution. What is it?

A. The Islamic Revolution is the name given to the Iranian revolution of 1979, when the ruling U.S.-supported monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. See timeline of recent Iranian history »

The country held a national referendum to become an Islamic republic and approve a new constitution.

The constitution was a hybrid of democracy and unelected religious leadership. It appointed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini -- the leader of the revolution -- the supreme leader of the country.

Before he died in 1989, he made it known that he wanted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to succeed him.

Q. Is it true that the ultimate power in Iran lies with Khamenei?

A. Yes. The supreme leader has the final say in all important matters of the country, such as ties with foreign nations or Iran's nuclear aspirations.

He appoints the Guardian Council -- the country's election authority. He also appoints key posts in the intelligence services and the armed forces, including the powerful Revolutionary Guard. Additionally, he confirms the president's election.

In theory, the supreme leader is appointed by a body of clerics whom voters elect. But in practice, this body -- the Assembly of Experts -- has answered to the supreme leader.

Khamenei, 70, was appointed supreme leader for life in 1989.

Q. What is the Guardian Council, which has been in the news, saying it will recount some of the votes in the disputed election?

A. The unelected Guardian Council is the second-most influential body in Iran politics. It consists of six theologians whom the supreme leader picks and six jurists nominated by the judiciary and approved by parliament.

The council approves all candidates running for office in the country, and verifies election results.

It vetoes bills passed by the parliament if they do not conform to the constitution and Islamic law.

In the present crisis, opposition leader Moussavi has had to take his grievance to the Guardian Council. It has agreed to some vote recounts. See galleries of protests in Iran »

Q. So, how much power does the president wield?

A. It depends on how nicely he plays with the Guardian Council.

The president is elected by direct vote to a four-year term, for a maximum of two terms.

He is responsible for economic policy and social programs, but most of the larger decisions are made by the supreme leader.

In theory, his powers are second to the supreme leader's. But in practice, he is often hamstrung by the Guardian Council.

The Guardian Council has worked with hard-liner Ahmadinejad, a 53-year-old former mayor of Tehran who was elected in 2005. But it thwarted reform attempts by his predecessor, Mohammad Khatami.

Q. What is the Revolutionary Guard, who said they will take legal action against pro-Moussavi Web sites?

A. The guard was initially created to protect the leaders of the revolution. But over the years, it has broadened its scope. Today, it is directly under the control of the supreme leader and enforces the governments' Islamic codes and morality

With more than 200,000 members, it is tasked with overseeing the country's crucial interests, including guarding its oil fields and missile arsenals.

Q. What is the Basij, who are said to be behind most of the violence against opposition supporters?

A. The Basij is a volunteer paramilitary force that takes orders from the Revolutionary Guard. It plays the role of de facto morality police and is often summoned to crack down on protests.

It is unknown how large the force is, though estimates are in the millions.

Q. What evidence is there of ballot fraud?

A. There are no concrete examples of fraud, because independent monitors did not oversee polling in Iran, but the circumstantial evidence is persuasive.

The government had initially said it would take three days to verify the ballots after Election Day on June 12. But the election authority proclaimed Ahmadinejad the winner two hours after the polls closed. At the same time, the interior ministry said that 85 percent of the country's 46 million eligible voters had cast ballots -- a record turnout.

To many, so many ballots could not have been hand-counted in such a short time.

Also, the published results showed that Ahmadinejad won even in his opponents' strongholds, including Moussavi's hometown of ethnic Azeri Turks.

"This is the equivalent of Barack Obama losing the African-American vote to John McCain in 2008," said Karim Sajadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Furthermore, Moussavi went into the election with massive support from the country's youth, who were unhappy with the faltering economy and an unemployment rate that tops 30 percent by some accounts. The youth make up 60 percent of Iran's population of 70 million.

Q. Is it true that Ahmadinejad still enjoys widespread support?

A. Yes. Ahmadinejad is popular across Iran's rural areas and among the Basij militia.

He presents himself as a populist and a fighter. He has paid attention to the families of the bloody Iran-Iraq war, offering special preferences to veterans' children in university admissions.

As president, his hardline approach has won him support among the Guardian Council. He has earned a reputation internationally as a fundamentalist for his Holocaust denials, calls to annihilate Israel, and cat-and-mouse games with the United States and the United Nations over Iran's nuclear activities. Many in the establishment view him as someone who does not cower to big-footing by the West.

Q. Why, then, do some analysts think the vote was manipulated?

A. Some experts say that even if it is likely that Ahmadinejad won the election, it is unlikely he could have won by the margin the government is claiming -- 62.63 percent of the vote.

Time magazine's Joe Klein explains it this way: "It is entirely possible that Ahmadinejad would have won anyway, but narrowly, perhaps with less than 50 percent of the vote, setting up a runoff election he might have lost as the other candidates united against him. It is possible that his government, perhaps acting in concert with supreme leader Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, decided to take no chances."

Q. Why is Iran's population so young?

A. After the revolution, the leaders encouraged early marriage and large families, rewarding families with cars and television sets for each additional child. During the country's devastating eight-year war with Iraq, which began in 1980, the regime continued encouraging population growth, because more children meant more future soldiers.

It is those children who are now coming of age.

Q. Why did Iran summon Switzerland's ambassador to complain about perceived U.S. involvement in Iran's election process?

A. The United States cut diplomatic ties with Iran following the hostage crisis in 1979, when students in support of the Islamic Revolution took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days.

Q. Is this movement a challenge to the Islamic republic?

A. The demonstrators say their demand is simple: Hold fresh elections. They say they are not out to challenge the Islamic regime. Watch protests Wednesday in Tehran »

Furthermore, Moussavi is an unlikely man for the job.

Though the 67-year-old former prime minister is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy as prime minister during the Iran-Iraq war, he also was a hard-liner whom the Economist described as a "firm radical."

He, like most Iranians in power, does not believe in the existence of Israel. He defended the taking of the American hostages in 1979. He was part of a regime that regularly executed dissidents. And as late as April, he opposed suspending the country's nuclear-enrichment program but said it would not be diverted to weapons use.

The protests have exposed a fissure in the country, however, with tens of thousands of Ahmadinejad backers taking to the streets in a show of force of their own.

Q. Are the current protests likely to continue?

A. For now, the government seems to be allowing the populace to vent pent-up frustrations. But it also is gradually cracking down, such as blocking Web sites and banning international journalists from filming the rallies.

The demonstrations have so far been focused on urban areas. Should the populace in rural areas take up the call for reform, the government might step in quickly to quash the protests, analysts say. See map of demonstration sites in Tehran »

Q. Is this the first time Iranians have risen up in mass protests against the regime?

A. No. Iran has twice seen public calls for reform in recent years: in 1999, after the closing of a reformist newspaper, and after parliamentary elections in 2000.

On both occasions, the Revolutionary Guard descended on the streets after a few days and crushed the movements.

Q. So, can true reform come to Iran?

A. It is possible. Ahmadinejad's predecessor, Khatami, was elected president in 1997 by a landslide, despite being a reformer. During his two terms, he championed freedom of expression, tried to mend diplomatic relations, and supported a free market. He was, however, hamstrung at every step by stiff resistance from the supreme leader and the Guardian Council.

Have to say I was deeply moved by the Tehran rallies - these people are fighting for liberal democracy in a region where it's never been popular, standing up to a conservative junta...it's like a mini-revolution for change, peace and freedom.

I just hope that whatever comes out of this will be done with civility and decency, though to quote V for Vendetta we must always be weary when people without guns march towards those who have them, it could turn very ugly, very quickly.
 
 
I don't now how liberal they want their democracy, but they've said loud and clear, they don't take kindly of being taken advantage of.
 
 
 
Persian women are hot no doubt, but it's also widely known that Iranian women have a high rate of plastic surgery amongst them, compared to the world in general. I remember reading that somewhere. So that also might have something to do with it, perhaps

 

Top 3% elite who can afford such a high price tagged constructive operation. Rest will always remain with the same appearance which nature (god, who ever that is) has allocated them for the rest of their lives. Beautiful or not.
Iranian women who goes under such an operation always wear midium to heavy make up, Channel eye wear, Burberry attire, Cartier watch, Prada purse and Coach shoes and the Lady in the picture does not look she belongs to that class.

I have seen a staged rally before ( when i was 8 or 9 y.o. ), i don't think ALL of them are troops.

 

Question is, how did they get access to 10s of 1000s of flags all same shape and size in such a short period of time? Everdau folks are not that privileged even if they wholeheartedly support AmAdinnerjacket.
BTW: Tall flags and banners always provide optical illusion that # of attendees is lot higher than what actually it is.
Just the # of IRGC, Basij, Badr Brigade, Ansar ol Hezbollh who are on call in Tehran 24/7 is enough to fill up 4 main crossing streets.

Same way North Koreans do in their rally. But that's besides the point.
 
 
 
Yeah, they should leave a crowd alone to burn the entire city, not just several buildings.

Looking at the ugly situation in "color revolutions" countries, I really hope Iranians are smarter, and can handle elections without destroing their state. :(

 

Dear Sir/Madam,
Infiltrating government agents under camouflage of civilian cloth into protesters and start vandalizing and destroying civilian properties and blame them on the opposition in order to tarnish their image has been practiced countless times by despotic, oligarchic dictatorships trough out the history of human civilization, and Iranian regime is no different.
I don't want to flood this thread with 100s pix and video clip to prove a point so allow to bring 2 evidences to your attention:
During Tuseday June 16th demonstration the entire protesters were all clapping with their hands on the air, this action didn't mean to imply that are happy and celebrating. They wanted the whole world to see they are not carrying anything except may be a bottle of water along with very small piece of paper with a short slogan written on it.
There is no single evidence of any one carrying a single tool required to destroy a city.
The picture below will show you who is actually vandalizing civilian propertie also note the top right corner who is actually commanding/instructing these goons. And NO he is not a civilian bystander, no civilian bystander has the guts to stick around while so many Robo-Cops are present.
In this sensitive time of Iranian recent history I don't believe those freedom seeking Iranians will take your insult lightly, neither will I.
So please refrain from commenting if you have nothing constructive to say and just keep praising A-jad in your solitude.
 
 
 
Same way North Koreans do in their rally. But that's besides the point.

 

The point is, take all the military, paramilitary personnel who have been ushered to the rally with Gov. buses and given flags, banners, horns and predetermined slogans away and then see who many real A-jad supporter will remain.

Also I'm amazed to see time after time world media saying 10s of 1000s of Iranian protesters in the streets when I see 100s of 1000s may be over million and at the same time they claim their journalists have been confined to their hotel rooms and banned from reporting direct within protesters by Iranian authorities.

Aryajet, i don't know...
Can you honestly look at those pictures and tell me how many are military, paramilitary personnel and how many are not ?
Regarding the second issue, i have not seen a article signed Colin Freeman in the Telegraph since Monday myself :(
 
 
To those who say Iranian women are mostly beautiful.
Look at this "Precious"!!
And goons ambush her place of business and crack her skull. They will pay for this, very soon I hope.

SAVAK used the same method in the beginning of the unrests in 1978. It backfired dramatically.

According to witnesses there was maybe 1 million people at the rally in Tehran today. And the demonstrations in province attracted a lot of people too.

Basijis are starting to hide their faces in the street now. Fear switched sides.  
 
 
Takes some real brave men to strike a woman. Pussies!  
 
 
Sorry, I was reading about how the "moral police" enforced the hijab and also was affected by alcoholic beverages, and in retrospect my comment might have been, well, a bit hysterical...

Do you know Michael Ledeen? He is a rather intriguing character, unabashedly hawkish neocon, and close Iran observer. He is writing about all this in a blog in pajamas media. This is the latest entry:

 
So NOW What’s Going on in Iran?

Michael Ledeen On June 17, 2009 @ 12:43 pm

Ahmadi-Nezhad has left the country, for one thing. He’s gone off to meet with some of his Russian friends. Why? Who knows? Maybe he’s looking at rental properties. But no doubt the Iranians have been talking to the Russians and the Chinese about, uh, “crowd control.” I don’t think either will have particularly useful ideas for the Iranian revolutionary movement, frankly. Sending in the tanks might appeal to Khamenei et. al., but there seems to be considerable evidence that the armed forces, even the Revolutionary Guards, are unreliable. Twitter messages abound in little scenes of friendly exchanges between police and dissidents. There are even stories of police arresting Basij thugs. And I haven’t seen a single account of Army repression. Quite the contrary; the Army seems to be trying to protect the dissidents by separating their would-be attackers from the demonstrators.

It seems that tomorrow, Thursday, will be the first big showdown. The regime is massing two Revolutionary Guards divisions for an assault on the dissidents–something like twenty thousand soldiers from outside Tehran–and the Mousavi people don’t want to give them time to organize and prepare their attacks. No doubt there are all kinds of secret meetings going on, as the various military, militia, religious and political leaders try to read the chicken entrails and guess their destiny. I don’t envy them the very brutal choice they now face, for despite some  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/op...etka.html?_r=1  embarrassingly silly opeds in places like the NY Times

"JUST after Iran’s rigged elections last week, with hundreds of thousands of protesters taking to the streets, it looked as if a new revolution was in the offing. Five days later, the uprising is little more than a symbolic protest, crushed by the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps."

the most powerful leaders in Iran are facing a life or death showdown. Both Khamenei and Mousavi–the two opposed icons of the moment, at least–know that they will either win or die. After nightfall, millions of revolutionaries chant from their rooftops “Allah is Great” and they are chants of defiance hurled at the Islamic Republic. I cannot imagine a soft landing.

Meanwhile, the regime is rounding up political leaders and killing dissidents. More than two score former VIPs of the regime are now in jail, according to the data given Khamenei, which lists the surprisingly low number of 36 dead over the past four and a half days. Given their paranoia of young people, and especially educated youth, it is no surprise that university campuses have been invaded, and anyone who looks like a “student” is attacked. This heart-rending letter has been circulating most of the day online (I posted it on The Corner):

"I am a medical student. There was chaos last night at the trauma section in one of our main hospitals. Although by decree, all riot-related injuries were supposed to be sent to military hospitals, all other hospitals were filled to the rim. Last night, nine people died at our hospital and another 28 had gunshot wounds. All hospital employees were crying till dawn. They (government) removed the dead bodies on back of trucks, before we were even able to get their names or other information. What can you even say to the people who don’t even respect the dead. No one was allowed to speak to the wounded or get any information from them. This morning the faculty and the students protested by gathering at the lobby of the hospital where they were confronted by plain cloths anti-riot militia, who in turn closed off the hospital and imprisoned the staff. The extent of injuries are so grave, that despite being one of the most staffed emergency rooms, they’ve asked everyone to stay and help—I’m sure it will even be worst tonight.

What can anyone say in face of all these atrocities? What can you say to the family of the 13 year old boy who died from gunshots and whose dead body then disappeared?

This issue is not about cheating(election) anymore. This is not about stealing votes anymore. The issue is about a vast injustice inflicted on the people."

I think that many pundits insist on thinking about the Iran-that-was-five-days-ago, instead of the bubbling cauldron that it is today. The same mistake is repeated when people say that Mousavi, after all, is “one of them,” a member of the founding generation of the Islamic Republic, and so you can’t expect real change from him. The president made that mistake when he said that he didn’t expect any real difference in Iran’s behavior, no matter how this drama plays out.

I think that is wrong; at this point, Mousavi either brings down the Islamic Republic or he hangs. If he wins, and the Islamic Republic comes down, we may well see the whole world change, from an end of the theocratic fascist system, to a cutoff of money, arms, technology, training camps and intelligence to the world’s leading terrorist organizations, and yes, even to a termination of the nuclear weapons program.

I think that, whatever or whoever Mir Hossein Mousavi was five days ago, he is now the leader of a mass movement that demands the creation of a free Iran that will rejoin the Western world. And yes, the wheel could turn again, this revolution could one day be betrayed, all kinds of surprises no doubt await the Iranian people. Yes, but. But today, there is a dramatic chance of a very good thing happening in Iran, and thus in the Middle East, and therefore in the whole world.

I have no doubt that Obama is being told by his intelligence czars and wizards that the regime is going to win, that the disturbances are not all that serious, and that he’s going to have to deal with Ahmadi-Nezhad for the next four years, so he’d better be careful not to offend the poor dear. That’s what every intelligence service ALWAYS says in these situations. It’s what the Israeli Mossad is saying publicly, for heaven’s sake:

Mossad chief Meir Dagan estimated that the civil unrest in Iran will not continue much longer.

Speaking to the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Dagan downplayed the significance of the riots, saying they are taking place only in Tehran and one other province.

Mr. Dagan, let us say, is phenomenally badly informed. The “riots” are taking place in every major city of Iran. Leon Panetta hasn’t made any public statements (bless him for that), but one will get you five that the CIA didn’t think there was any chance of this sort of all-out confrontation as of “election-circus day” and while they have no doubt hedged a bit since then, they still likely bet on a regime win.

Which is why I have a limited sympathy for Obama’s efforts to say nothing much, even though I don’t like it, and I think it’s a mistake on his own grounds. As I said last time, it’s wrong to think that your chances of getting a deal from your enemy is enhanced if you appease him. Reagan got lots of deals from the Soviet Union, even though he denounced it most every day.

As Obama discovered just today, America will be accused of meddling on behalf of freedom, even if we do nothing. And the accusation will have been true, in the most fundamental sense, even though the State Department raced to deny it. We are the symbol of freedom in the modern world, and those fighting for freedom against tyrants will intuitively invoke our name and our Constitution in their struggle. They are right, for the very existence of America threatens the legitimacy of the tyrants.

We meddle because we exist.
 

 Faster, Please! 
 
 
By the way I think I disagree with Ledeen that President Obama should overtly step in or inflame the rhetoric.

Expressing concern for mistreatment is enough I think.

For the time being.
 
 
Obama did the best thing possible at this time. Just stay neutral, with the slightest hint of support for the protests coming from his aides, not the president himself. He kept a balanced tone.

If he supported Ahmadinejad, then wtf...?
If he supported Mousavi, then he will simply be seen as yet another U.S. president pushing the regular agenda of forced democratization in the Middle East, and thus empower and give voice to the fanatical Islamic radicals in the region who are just waiting for a mistake by Obama to turn against him. Can't have such a thing happen only days after the major speech in Cairo.

Obama has done well so far. Let his actions be dictated by events on the ground; not him dictating events on the ground by speaking prematurely.
 
 
 
...Obama has done well so far...

 

For his country I have to disagree with that statement. For the world, well I guess we shall see.

As for his standing back during the Iranian election, I have to agree. Why should he worry about the liberty of any other nation.

We are after all 'friends of liberty everywhere, but defenders of only our own.' That is an old paraphrased quote that probably marks me as a domestic terrorist, but I don't mind. Maybe He'll call ME a freedom fighter? Nah, I'll probably just be a domestic archethect of life's bad roll of the dice...

I'm listening to Johnny Cash's 'One Piece at a Time' if that means anything...
 
 
There seems to be top level power play behind this Iran election, between the previous Ayatollah Rafsanjani and his current successor Ayatollah Khamenei.

 Khamenei-Rafsanjani Split Limits Power to Stop Unrest 

 
June 19 (Bloomberg) -- In 1989, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, then the most powerful figure in Iran, supported Ayatollah Ali Khameneis appointment as supreme spiritual leader.

Now, the two men are locked in conflict amid a wave of protests against the June 12 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a Khamenei ally. Rafsanjani supports Mir Hossein Mousavi, who says that he won the vote and has drawn hundreds of thousands of Iranians into the streets to rally behind him.

Ahmadinejad and Mousavi are the public faces of a power struggle among Irans ruling clerics. As the country is swept up in protests not seen since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the conflict risks undermining the regimes existence, said Mohammad-Reza Djalili, an Iran expert at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.

The divisions within the ruling elite in Iran are making it very hard for the authorities to crack down decisively, Djalili said. The regime is going through its biggest crisis in 30 years. The divisions are getting deeper and deeper.

Khamenei, in a prayers address in Tehran, televised live, today rejected the opposition demands for a new election. It would not be acceptable to agree to illegal demands, this would be the start of dictatorship, he said. The supreme leader also warned the countrys political elites against lawbreaking, saying they would be held responsible if unrest continues.

Rafsanjanis support legitimizes Mousavis fight against the regime, broadening his base and making it harder for the government to respond, said Cliff Kupchan, a senior analyst at New York-based Eurasia Group.....
 
 
 
Khamenei has officialy endorsed Ahmadinedjad, now for those who still had illusions about his position and the possiblity that this conflict could be solved according to the rules, this is the end. Every new demonstrations will be against the regime itself not about the elections.
 
 
I wrote the information wrong about the two Ayatollahs. This one below should be a more correct version.

 
The two, who are among the most veteran figures in the Islamic regime in Iran, were among the protégés of ayatollah Khomeini, and since the Islamic republic’s establishment assumed the most senior posts there.

During the Khomeini era, Khamenei served as president, while Rafsanjani was the parliament speaker; after the leader of the revolution died, Khamenei became the supreme leader and Rafsanjani became president and the head of two of the regime’s most important councils.

Over the years, the two figures have distanced from each other, and although both belong to the conservative camp, Khamenei adopted a stricter line, while Rafsanjani adopted a more pragmatic approach.
 

This quote is taken from here.  War of the ayatollahs 
 
 
 
By the way I think I disagree with Ledeen that President Obama should overtly step in or inflame the rhetoric.

For the time being.

Sorry for misspell in the title, I can't fix it. Here is what I meant to type. "Sir Castellano" :D
 
 
I'm glad Obama is continuing to hold on to a neutral position on the Iran election and protests.

 Obama holds to measured course on unrest in Iran 

 
1 hr ago WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration on Friday stuck to a measured response to the uprising in Iran over a disputed presidential election, even as both houses of Congress voted overwhelmingly to condemn an official crackdown on mostly peaceful demonstrations in the streets of Tehran.

Administration officials said they remained convinced that the wiser U.S. course was caution over confrontation. President Barack Obama is coming under growing domestic political pressure to speak out more forcefully in support of protesters warned by Iran's supreme leader Friday to end their huge street rallies.....

A long-standing source of Iranian anger at the U.S. is the CIA's role in toppling the elected government of Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953 and replacing him with the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the Shah, student militants occupied the U.S. Embassy and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. In April 1980, Washington severed diplomatic relations with Iran.

Obama, who hopes to draw Tehran into talks aimed at curtailing its nuclear ambitions and potentially ending the 29-year-old rupture in diplomatic relations, has stayed mostly neutral on the election dispute. He has spoken in measured terms about supporting Iranians' aspirations to have their voices heard.....
 
 
 
Hannity on his show last night suggested that Obama's restrained response to events in Iran may have something to do with concern that Iran might stir up trouble in Iraq in retaliation if he took a more outspoken stance. Hannity suggested the US had a tacit understanding with Iran to keep Sadr bottled up in Qum.

Fox's foreign policy expert on the show disagreed. He pointed out that A-jad is likely to prevail and that Obama fears coming down too heavily on the other will obscure the real goal of ending Iran's aspirations to join the nuclear club.

What do you all think about it?
 
 
The US and Israel saved their butts during the Iran-Iraq War and two American gestures of friendship (Regan and Obama) were returned with slaps in the face and two wars against Israel.
 
 
The world is leaning on Iran and, for that matter, N.Korea too. Let them throw their tizzy fits and call us what they want. They have no out. Nor do we. No nukes. Period. They have time left to engage in face saving. But not much.
 
 
The planned opposition rally is due to proceed. There may be bloody confrontation.

 Iran opposition to go ahead with rally: candidate aide 

 
53 minutes ago TEHRAN, Iran (AFP)  Iran's opposition will go ahead with a planned rally in Tehran despite a government warning against new protests, an aide to defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi told AFP.

"I have not heard anything indicating that the rally has been cancelled," he said on condition of anonymity.

The rally will be held at 4:00 pm (1130 GMT) at Tehran's Enghelab square as announced before by Karroubi, he said.

The demonstration is being organised by Karroubi supporters and a reformist group, the Combattant Clerics Assembly.

The plan to hold the rally comes despite Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning the opposition groups against holding street protests....

Any possibility of the Iranian opposition try to force a reelection is now out of the window with the Ayotollah taking the side of the incumbent.
That apart, he has stood by Ajad saying his foreign policy and other key policies are close to his own. So there is no chance that anything is going to come out of the protests.
Its now a wait and watch approach for the world as to what first step Ajad takes in his second innings.

Obama has zero chance of talking the present regime out of the nukes program. So if that is the reason for the restraint, it doesn't make sense.

However, this were Obama's words yesterday:

 
we stand behind those who are seeking justice in a peaceful way. Already weve seen violence out there. Ive said this throughout the week, I want to repeat it, that we stand with those who would look to peaceful resolution of conflict and we believe that the voices of people have to be heard, that thats a universal value that the American people stand for and this administration stands for.
 

Commentators I respect like Charles Krauthammer, Victor Davis Hanson or Mark Steyn are asking for a stronger message, but I fail to see what would be the point, and I think it could be used by the regime to be even more violent against the protesters.

In my opinion, at this point, it is enough to subtly let the protesters know the US stands with them, no need to be emphatic; I think protesters know very well what they are going through.

A lot of people saying today could be a crucial day.

didn't the chinese fail to predict the end of the shah's regime?
 
 
3 years ago I befriended a Iranian exile at my work named Potkin Azarmehr. He turned out to be a very active anti-regime activist, sometimes interviewed by CNN, BBC etc...

He writes in his blog about what is going to happen today:

 
Don't forget to attend the demos wherever you are. Wouldn't it be great if thousands of non-Iranians join in solidarity too. Keep the momentum going!

I am not a spiritual person, can't remember the last time I prayed but tonight I will say a prayer, hoping God will protect the children of Iran.
 

His blog:

 For a democratic secular Iran. For peace and prosperity in the Middle East. 

BBC interview June 13th:
 
 
I think there is a lot of violence, very worrying
 
 
A bomb exploded near Ayatollah Khomeyni's mausoleum. There is one dead and many wounded. Lot of violence currently going on in Tehran and elsewhere. Basiji against the people who want to attend the rally. Today is decisive for the people of Iran. My prayers go to these heroic youths.
 
 
It's undoubtely the regime behind the bombs (I heard of more than one) What do you think Oscar ?
 
 
 
It's undoubtely the regime behind the bombs (I heard of more than one) What do you think Oscar ?

 

They are perfectly capable of doing that. On the other hand that would be close to a blasphemy for them...I mean its Khomeyni.

Or this is the work of the most extreme elements of the contestation. Think People's Mujahdjeen or any other marxist group.
 
 
The location of the Ayatollah Kohemeini Moseuleum is far south of the marching route which goes from east to west. It is not known if it is really a suicide bomb as the source is semi-official and well known to be unreliable.

Already the opposition was speculating yesterday that the government may create such an emotive event to blame it on the opposition to lead to crack down.

Ayatollah Khamenei may disallow rally marches, but he would avoid violent forces to stop them, and try to reduce deaths and too much blood shed. He can remember very well the historic lesson that, in spite of the overwhelming strength of the Shah's military and police forces, it was these bloody protests marches that brought the Shah's regime down.
 
 
Fighting in Tehran, confused reports and tweets right now. There was a suicide bomber at the tomb of Khomeni 2 dead and multiple injured. Reports of police helicopters spraying the crowds with a water/agent mixture that makes it feel like your skin is on fire. Videos with distinctive automatics weapons fire being heard. Reports Mousavi is "ready for death" and that the opposition will still go on. Reports of the crowd chanting death to Khamenei.
 
 
An analyst on CNN was rather suspicious that though the report of the bomb blast came from official sources, we have yet to see any pictures.

The point is that if you back the wrong side, it comes back to haunt you.

In 1991, Reagan failed at first to condemn the attempted coup against Gorbachov and Yeltsin. Secretary of State Shultz convinced him to come out with a stronger condemnation. The coup failed in 3 days. No doubt the better side won.

I'm speechless. An innocent soul, may she rest in peace, and may the person who shot her rot in hell! That was very very difficult to watch.
 
 
I think Obama is handling it well. Unless, the United States is prepared to get involved militarily. The last thing the US wants to do is give false hope. Remember what happened with the Hungarians in the 1950s and the Shiaa in Iraq under Bush the First. They revolted at our encouragement and then got slaughtered when we didn' t back them up.. Their blood is thus on our hands.

Now the Iranians have a realistic understanding of the risks if they protest. But aren't lured by false hopes of us getting involved.

And getting involved could easily proof problematic. The Iranians might regard it as an invasion and unite against us. Or, China and Russia could react extremely horribly to us getting involved that way.

 Mousavi: 'To the slaughterhouse' 

 
TEHRAN, June 20 (UPI) -- Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi attacked the Supreme Leader in a statement on his Facebook page posted Saturday.

The response to a speech Friday by Ayatollah Ali Khameini said the government is taking the country "to the slaughterhouse," CNN reported. CNN said it could not confirm that the statement, posted in Farsi, was actually from Mousavi....

Since the election, thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest the results and there were reports Saturday that at least 19 people -- and perhaps as many as 150 --had been killed in protest-related violence.

Iran poll result 'harms US hopes'

Ahmadinejad has clashed with West over Iran's nuclear ambitions and his comments on Israel [AFP]

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's victory in Iran's presidential election is likely to be a blow to hopes for US rapprochement with Iran.

Washington has had no official ties with Tehran since shortly after the Islamic revolution in 1979, but Barack Obama, the US president, has expressed his openness to dialogue since coming to power in January.

Analysts said on Saturday that victory for Ahmadinejad, who has crossed swords repeatedly with the West over Iran's nuclear ambitions and his criticism of Israel, could stall any attempts at improving relations.

"In Washington there was a severe wish to make sure Mousavi [Ahmadinejad's reformist rival] would be the winner because of the atmospherics and the comfort level in not dealing with Ahmadinejad and dealing with him," Trita Parsi, the president of National American Iranian Council, told Al Jazeera.

'Robust debate'

Before the results started to come out, Obama said that he was excited about the debate taking place in Iran and he hoped it would help the two countries to engage "in new ways".

"Whoever ends up winning the election in Iran, the fact that there's been a robust debate hopefully will help advance our ability to engage them in new ways," he said.

However, Rami Khoury, the editor-at-large of Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper, told Al Jazeera that the decisive victory could have been a reaction to widely-stated Western hopes for a reformist win.

"They probably didn't like the fact that this was being portrayed in the international press... as though Obama's speeches were changing the Middle East," he said.

"This tells us that Tehran is not Tennessee, there is a difference in how things happen.

"The US doesn't know what is going on in Iran because it doesn't have anybody there," Khoury said.

"It has no officials, it has had no contact with Iran officially for 30 years, so there is a huge gap in knowledge of the basic sentiments of the Iranian people or the leadership."

Mutual respect

Ahmadinejad has previously said that Iran would welcome talks with the US, but only if there was mutual respect between the two nations.

Officials in Tehran have said that means the accusations that Iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons and supports terrorism must stop.

In March, Obama made a speech to mark Nowruz, the start of the Persian New Year in which he called for a "new beginning" to relations and stressed his respect for the Iranian people.

But Ayatollah Ali Khameini, Iran's supreme leader, dismissed the message saying that the US still had to show it had changed its attitude towards the country.

Hady Amr, a political analyst at the Brookings Institute, told Al Jazeera that he expected the Obama administration to give Ahmadinejad's second-term government another chance to respond to such overtures.

"If they don't respond, the policy could change around the New Year," he said.

Israeli reaction

Meanwhile, Washington's main ally in the region, Israel, said that the re-election of Ahmadinejad underlined the fact that the international community must act to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

"If they don't respond, the policy could change around the New Year"

"If there was a shadow of hope for a change in Iran, the renewed choice of Ahmadinejad expresses more than anything the growing Iranian threat," Danny Ayalon, Israel's deputy foreign minister, said in a statement.

Yigal Palmor, a spokesperson for the Israeli foreign ministry, told Al Jazeera: "The challenge that Iran poses to the international community does not rest on personality.

"It stems from its policies. A policy of obtaining at all costs nuclear weapons, a policy of promoting violence and terrorism throughout the region... This is something that should stop. It really doesn't matter who the president is.

"All the international community should concentrate on making Iran a friendly country... to its neighbours and the region."

However, Afshin Molavi of the New America Foundation think-tank told Al Jazeera that there were many in the Israeli government who might welcome the outcome.

"In many ways, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for many folks in Tel Aviv who would like to see a serious confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme, is a gift because of his outlandish statements about the Holocaust," he said.

"I would imagine that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is not unhappy with these results."

Israeli officials have repeatedly stressed the need for the US and its allies to act to prevent Iran from building atomic weapons. Tehran says that its nuclear programme is purely to meet civilian energy needs.

Basij Headquarters set ablaze:

After the innocent people these goons have killed, let them have it!    
 
 
That's certainly great news but do we have any other photos of the headquarters to compare with?
 
 
I think it is worth to state clearly who has really rooted for A-jad, and who has congratulated him for his "divine victory".

Syria (Assad has come out of the closet), Hamas & Hezbollah
 
 
 
.... Syria (Assad has come out of the closet), Hamas & Hezbollah

 

These are expected, arn't they?
 
 
Yes well, I'm just dreaming of possibilities.

Dominoes anyone?
 
 
If the regime gets away with it though, it won't be quite the same regime. I think I agree it would have transformed from a theocracy to an ideological military dictatorship.

JAD,

I don't think there is much secret about Netanyahu being pleased about this. Extremism feeds on extremism - A-jad & Hamas are the best freinds Likud has.
 
 
 
The Persians are very strange. On one side they hate the Islamic government but one the side they don't want to do anything to fight it. I believe not all of the population participated in this vote. Like the ones I met in Germany. They had chance to go to Frankfurt to vote but none of them did it.
Mousavi vowed to fight against fraud which means there may be some unrest but personally I think nothing will happen.

 

I appologize to all Persians with my previous statement. Your blood proves you deserve democracy. Now those Basij have to fight for their life. If the people win, just hang all of them.
I think it is time for international community to show our support. I hope to see protests everywhere to fight together with Persian people.
 
 
 
JAD,

That attempt to draw moral equivalence won't wash. Is not even close. And it is actually outrageous to suggest otherwise.

If some guy in al-Jihad can speculate that Netanyahu preferred A-jad to be handpicked by the regime (which I don't doubt), so I can also speculate that the puppet masters who bankroll that guy and the rest of the edifice of lies of al-Jihad are devastated that the Iranian people have risen up against tyranny, as in fact are quite some people in the Middle East who are not from Israel nor Iran.

It is a certainty that Netanyahu would prefer a free Iran, and that is a problem for all those non-Iranians who seem quite ready to fight Israel to the last Iranian.

So let's tell it like it is, no Bigfella ?
 
 
 
The unrest in Iran makes me green with envy

By Gideon Levy

It makes one green with envy: The scenes from Iran prove that some nations are trying to take their fate into their own hands. Some nations are not floating on the surface in sickly indifference, some are not looking around in endless complacence. And some are not following their leaders with the blindness of a herd. There are moments in the histories of certain nations when the people say enough. No more.

Czechs and Ukrainians, French and Russians, South Africans and Palestinians, Thais and Chinese, Lebanese and now Iranians have taken to the streets on at least one inspirational occasion and tried to make an impact. Some succeeded, some failed, but at least they tried. They did not surrender to their failed leaders, who dragged them from bad to worse. This is not only about rising up against a tyrannical regime; sometimes it's about a struggle for justice in democracies, too. That struggle is not conducted only in polls and elections; such struggles must spill out onto the streets. Here, too.

The scenes from oppressive Iran are of light breaking through. Thousands of women and men protesting and demonstrating, holding signs and shouting out loud. They stand with their faces visible, fearless. All of them are at risk because of their protest. Perhaps less than what we imagine here - our learned analysts know that there is only an Iran of darkness - but certainly much more than in free Israel.

But while Iran's women are taking a risk and demanding that their voice be returned to them, Israel's women are wrapping themselves in silence, from the mall to the parking lot. As Tehran's men cry out "Where is our voice?", here they ask "Where will our next vacation be?" Here in the SUV, there in the streets. Here in front of the stupefying television screen, there in front of the forces of evil. Here in darkness, there in the light of popular protest.

We only take to the streets when there is a festival, hardly ever because of a scandal. Tel Aviv's centennial or the book festival, the beer festival or the tomato festival - but never in protest. In Iran they are fighting for liberty, here for vacation time.

It's true, there is liberty in Israel, but only for us, the Jews. We have a regime that is no less tyrannical than the ayatollahs' regime: the regime of the officers and the settlers in the territories. But what do we have to do with any of this? In Iran, police disperse demonstrations with violence, they shoot and kill. And what do we do?

When you get a chance, go on Friday to Na'alin or Bil'in and see what happens there. Demonstrators are killed here with similar brutality, but in Iran the crowd is standing up to a tyrannical regime, while here only a handful of brave people stand up to the Border Police, who are firing weapons. Moreover, we hardly write anything about the protest being silenced with bullets. It interests no one, and this, too, is called democracy.

A democracy is not tested only with elections. A democracy is measured in everyday life. National aims are not achieved only through power hungry politicians; the street must also speak. In the latest polls, 64 percent of Israelis say they support a two-state solution. Great. But when Israel moves steadily away from such a solution, when the prime minister takes a small step forward but then raises more and more impossible obstacles, no one thinks to do anything. Have you heard a single political conversation recently? Nothing.

One can only imagine what would have happened if the day after Benjamin Netanyahu's speech, that same silent and paralyzed majority that allegedly wants two states had taken to the streets to demand an end to the occupation. Or if they demanded that we say yes to the Arab peace initiative. What a boost that would have been, a genuine wind of change on whose strength Barack Obama, Netanyahu, Mahmoud Abbas and Bashar Assad could move forward together.

But when the street is silent, only the leaders are left, and their survival drives them.

Israel is now at a fateful crossroads, no less than Iran. An opportunity lies before it that will not be seen again, one that affects the future of all its people no less than the election results in Iran affect the Iranians' fate. Missing the opportunity here will be just as decisive as four more years of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in power. But look what is happening in totalitarian Iran and what is happening here, the sole democracy in the Middle East, blah, blah, blah.

Lets indeed Castellano. First, lets burn down the straw man you started with. There was no attempt at 'moral equivalence'. Jorg Haider was an extremist, so was Pol Pot. That does not make them identical or morally equivalent, just possessed of extreme opinions/policies.

Likud thrives on the perception of threat to the Israeli state. Absent that it exists on the fringe of Israeli politics. It is a profoundly corrupt organization founded by terrorists & fascist sympathizers that allies itself with the nastiest sorts of extremists. A-jad & Hamas are a gift to the likes of Netanyahu because they provide him with distractions or standing excuses.

As for a free Iran, that wasn't up for grabs at the start of this election & it isn't now. I wish it was. I believe it will be one day, but today isn't it. Pretending otherwise is about rhetorical posturing - usually in an attempt to beat someone else over the head (read Krauthammer's POS diatribe for an example).

That is very much how it is.

Is very easy.

Should Israel end the so called "occupation" (that consequence not cause, of Arab violence against the Jewish state), say tomorrow, the West Bank turns into Hamastán II in less that 24 hours.

And what happens then?

Nope. You explicictly linked them when you said "extremism feeds extremism".

 
Likud thrives on the perception of threat to the Israeli state. Absent that it exists on the fringe of Israeli politics.
 

Yes. But is not a"perception". Is thousands and thousands of civilians brutally killed in thousands and thousands of terrorist attacks. 4 major Wars. Several more lesser scale conflicts. And every single one of them started from outside.

 
It is a profoundly corrupt organization founded by terrorists & fascist sympathizers that allies itself with the nastiest sorts of extremists.
 

No. Is a democratic party, which has proved its democratic credentials over and over in due democratic process. And the rest of what you say is either false or grossly exaggerated.

I challenge you to name a single political party in the Middle East outside Israel with better democratic credentials. That should be fun.

 
A-jad & Hamas are a gift to the likes of Netanyahu because they provide him with distractions or standing excuses.
 

Let's have something clear now, talking of strawmans, I personally think B Netanyahu is probably a mediocre man. Unlike his brother. And indeed, he wouldn't be in power without the savage Palestinian terrorism.

That said, if you believe Netanyahu is just exhilarated with the existence of Hamas or A-jad, well, that proves that you would do absolutely anything to perpetuate your multicultural fantasies and entertain frivolous moral equivalence misconceptions.

Iran Rafsanjani Family Members Arrested Says State Media-BBC 

What does this mean for the power struggle? Can any Iran watchers enlighten us?

 

I can offer this:

 
We don't know yet how aggressively Iran's clerical overlord, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Ahmadinejad rigged the balloting. Ahmadinejad remains popular in small town Iran and among the urban poor. His constant attacks on the corrupt revolutionary elite--especially the fabulously wealthy cleric Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who probably bankrolled Mousavi's run for the presidency--resonate, even among highly Westernized Iranians who align themselves with the "pragmatic" Rafsanjani.

....

Khamenei, who worked with and struggled against Mousavi for a decade, knows the former prime minister politically as well as anyone. The supreme leader knows that what Mousavi lacks in charisma he has always made up in doggedness. That Khamenei baited the candidate, and so carelessly denied millions of Iranians the illusion that their votes mattered, shows how insular and insecure Khamenei, a politicized cleric of some intellectual sensitivity, has become in his august office. Whatever Mousavi has inside, it was enough to scare Khamenei profoundly, and not just because the supreme leader didn't want to hand a victory to Rafsanjani, Khamenei's brother-in-arms-turned-foe. Without Rafsanjani, the reformist cleric Mohammed Khatami would never have risen to the presidency, which he held from 1997 to 2005. Once Khatami was in office, both Khamenei and Rafsanjani worked to gut the reform movement that enveloped him. Regardless of their deep personal differences, Khamenei and Rafsanjani no doubt could work together in the future to gut Mousavi if the Machiavellian Rafsanjani felt so inclined.

For now, though, Rafsanjani is backing Mousavi for his own survival. Ahmadinejad dreams of downing Rafsanjani and his entire spoiled clan. For the poor-boy former Revolutionary Guardsman who fought in the Iran-Iraq war, Rafsanjani is the quintessential target of the anti-mullah jokes that are a staple of life among Iran's poor. Ahmadinejad also undoubtedly remembers that Rafsanjani, for good reason, once tried to abolish Ahmadinejad's beloved Revolutionary Guard by folding them into Iran's regular army.

Similarly, Khamenei backs Ahmadinejad overwhelmingly for one reason: fear of Khatami. (Hurting Rafsanjani is an ancillary pleasure.) Not Khatami personally, but what he represented between 1997, when he won the presidency by a landslide, and 2000, when the regime fully recovered its authoritarian composure. Although certain American analysts like to belittle the historic importance of Khatami ("Really just Khamenei with a smile"), the movement behind him terrified Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard Corps (Pasdaran).

The only fantasies here are yours Castellano. Fantasies about what I said, fantasies about what I meant & fantasies about Likud. Pure propaganda.
 
 
Yeah right.

That's why is the second time I read it from you. The despicable moral equivalence attempt I mean, between a guy like A-jad, and a member of the present democratic government of Israel.
 
 
 
Its sad but I would think that the majority of Iranians still support Ahmadinedjad.

 

I'm afraid I still stand by my comment. I have looked at Khatami's past results at the presidential elections of 1997 and 2001 and he enjoyed pretty much the same results in the first round (to be frank it was an even bigger victory) as the ones credited to Ahmadinedjad this year.

And Khamenei was already in charge at the time.

But contrary to what I said, it has its importance. That means there's a silent majority that still supports the regime.

Maybe you are disregarding the effects of the recent events on the silent majority.
I mean, even if they supported Ahmadinedjad before, is it still the case now ?

Maybe they don't agree with the way the governement handled the protests...But its still their votes...And they won't join the opponents to overthrow the regime because of that.

You seriously want to compare Khatami's support to Amj's. Seriously? I know people who have been to Iran, and the people there are fairly moderate who want reform of the system. It's why Khatami got such he votes, but unfortunately his movement was clamped down, and it didn't exactly lead to better relations with the West either.

So as a result what happened is a lot of young people became disillusioned and didn't vote at all and so Amj was elected. Now, let's make this clear too, Amj "barely" won last, and the Iranian economy is now completely in shambles. And you think with the Iranian economy in shambles, huge amounts of the population upset because they have less personal freedoms, that the people are going to give the guy more support than they did last time. Or do you think it's possible that some of those who did not vote last time, will vote this time.

And really that the Iranians are going to really want a hardliner president, when they have an American president finally willing to deal with them?

Please. It's possible Khomeni is running scared because now there's an American President actually willing to deal with Iran, when there wasn't when Khatami was in power.

Amj, was never as popular as Khatami.

 
And they won't join the opponents to overthrow the regime because of that.
 

Who says the regime will be overthrown? My suspicican is that eventually Khomeni will gotten rid off and there will be a new more practical Supreme Leader. Reforms will happen, and there will be new elections, but the Revolation won't be completely over thrown.
 
 
 
It's undoubtely the regime behind the bombs (I heard of more than one) What do you think Oscar ?

 

Just like rigging election so clumsy this bomb attack also ended up being a hoax.

The reports from state controlled media indicated that a suicide bomber exploded himself in "SHOES KEEPING ROOM" of the mausoleum and the dead is the bomber himself and the injured was the attendant of the room. No one else was killed or injured since the 2 were the only people present.

The most humorous part is the picture they published in one news paper showing just one small window glass is shattered and glass pieces fallen right by the door not blown away which will happen in any blast inside confinement of a room.
I think he must be the most stupid suicide bomber in the history, go blow yourself up to harm some shoes.:D
I applaud him for being the genuine "Shoe Bomber" not the other guy in US.
 
 
 
They are perfectly capable of doing that. On the other hand that would be close to a blasphemy for them...I mean its Khomeyni.

Or this is the work of the most extreme elements of the contestation. Think People's Mujahdjeen or any other marxist group.

 

Khomeini is dead in regime's book.
Heck they don't even pretend to be religious any more, they're acting like a full blown tyranny with an iron fist.
Yesterday they managed to fill up the entire hospitals of Tehran with injured to a point where 27 embassies of other nations opened doors to take in and treat injured. Mid afternoon (Tehran time) Canadian Embassy plead to Tehranians asking for volunteer Doctors and nurses.

I think the majority of world need to learn 1 or 2 from Canada, always standing on the side of who is right.
 
 
 
JAD,

I don't think there is much secret about Netanyahu being pleased about this. Extremism feeds on extremism - A-jad & Hamas are the best freinds Likud has.

 

It was a tongue-in-cheek question? A kinder and gentler Iran still committed to "peaceful" production of fissionable material, would make his call to use force against Iran more difficult to sell.
 
 
 
Is very easy.

Should Israel end the so called "occupation" (that consequence not cause, of Arab violence against the Jewish state), say tomorrow, the West Bank turns into Hamastán II in less that 24 hours.

And what happens then?

 

you reference a "so called" occupation. is it or isnt it sn occupation?
 
 
 
Aryajet, i don't know...
Can you honestly look at those pictures and tell me how many are military, paramilitary personnel and how many are not ?
Regarding the second issue, i have not seen a article signed Colin Freeman in the Telegraph since Monday myself :(

 

I believe he is fine. He has an article about recent Iranian crisis in Telegraph, don't know if has written it the same day but it was published June 20th.

Yeah right.

That's why is the second time I read it from you. The despicable moral equivalence attempt I mean, between a guy like A-jad, and a member of the present democratic government of Israel.

 

More fantasies Castellano. And you can save the moral outrage, coming from somoene who can't admit to Israeli occuption without putting the word in quotes I consider it a badge of honor.

So, tell me how this 'free Iran' is going to come about from the current circumstance. Who are its champions? How are they going to bring it about? You seem to be crossing the line between wishful thinking & reality (again).

Careful JAD, the thought police are about.

Yes it is occupation, and I hope a deal can be reached and Israel leaves most of the West Bank as soon as possible. That's what Israelis want too, Likud or no Likud, but the occupation is a consequence, not a cause of Arab violence, and even so, the Israelis have tried to end it a few times: last time in 2008 with Olmert.

I remember exactly in what other thread you did it and in what terms. The "occupation", outside the objective political status of a certain territory (like Tibet, Cyprus etc...), is the rhetorical excuse from people who desperately want to subvert causes and consequences and so portrait this conflict as if it was a 50-50 event.

They are the very same people who cannot name a single political party in the entire Middle East outside of Israel with better democratic credentials than the Likud. Yet, they demonize the Likud as if somehow the intractability of the conflict was its fault.

 
So, tell me how this 'free Iran' is going to come about from the current circumstance. Who are its champions? How are they going to bring it about? You seem to be crossing the line between wishful thinking & reality (again).
 

I know the regime can fall. That is not yet a free Iran, but starts to get closer. And if the regime indeed falls, I don't see it replaced by another authoritarian regime.

I'm not saying it will become a full fledged democracy like Sweden overnight, and yes, in this case I accept that I can be the victim of wishful thinking; still, Iranians among other things are a cultivated society, which seems to suggest that they can be able to produce some kind of consensual-based Government.

If it's a consequence of Arab violence, then why has most of the casualties between Israelis and Palestinians happened after 1967 and with the increase in settlement activity?
 
 
I think Obama's stance on this has been about as good as it can be. In 1991 when protests broke out in Iraq towards Saddam Hussein, George H W Bush supported it, telling the people to defy him. He responded by killing the people doing it, and in the end it was America and Bush who received a large portion of the blame. Obama doesn't want this to turn into a focus on us. The people of Iran need to create this change.

What is now needed for this to really turn into our favor, is that some in the army of Iran, need to defy the government and suppy people with guns. That, would create some major change.

Ah, so that was the girls name, where the "Neda" chant originated from? I was wondering that - thanks.
 
 
Khamenei and Rafsanjani may be at odds now, but twenty years ago it was Rafsanjani who helped Khamenei get to the top.

The clip has subtitles.

 YouTube - Rafsanjani chose supreme leader in 1989 (with subtitles) 

I wonder how much real power does Rafsanjani's Assembly of Experts have?.. while it can constitutionally remove Khamenei, it has not done anything to be recollection since late 80s.

If it's a consequence of Arab violence, then why has most of the casualties between Israelis and Palestinians happened after 1967 and with the increase in settlement activity?

 

No that's not correct. The majority of casualties have been prior to 1967, although I don't think that the number of casualties by itself would prove anything.

Consider these points:

Why did Israel occupied those territories?

Because it was attacked by Jordan from those territories (by the way, it only magically occurred to Palestinians to become Palestinians after 1967, before they were Jordanians who did not challenge Jordan's annexation at all.)

Did "occupation" exist before 67?

According to the 1964 PLO charter yes. The entire territory of Israel is "occupied".

Did the Israelis try to end the occupation?

Yes.
For example, right after 67, first inception of the peace for territories formula, to which the Arab nations replied with the 3 Nos of the Khartoum Conference; in Taba 2001 with Ehud Barak; and in 2008 with Olmert. Which brings the next question...

So why did the Palestinians reject the deal in 2001 or 2008?

Because the conflict is most certainly not about the occupation, the settlements or the Palestinian State. It is not about territory. And if the Israelis ended the occupation tomorrow, they will have to come back in 24 hours to reoccupy and we are back to square one.

Because as I said, the occupation is, and has always been, a consequence, not a cause of violence against the Jewish state.

There seems to be two separate battles being fought in Iran.

One is the younger generation including women asking for freedom from the ruling elite. The average age of Iran is only 27.

The other is within the ruling elite between the two factions headed by the two Ayatollahs - Khamanei and Rafsanjani.

This below is about the second battle.

 Struggle among Iran's clerics bursts into the open 

 
20 min ago TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — A backstage struggle among Iran's ruling clerics burst into the open Sunday when the government said it had arrested the daughter and other relatives of an ayatollah who is one of the country's most powerful men.

State media said four relatives of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani were later released, but the arrests appeared to be a clear warning from the hardline establishment to a cleric who may be aligning himself with the opposition....

Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi warned supporters of danger ahead, and said he would stand by the protesters "at all times."

The former prime minister, a longtime loyalist of the Islamic government, also called the Basij and military "our brothers" and "protectors of our revolution and regime." He may be trying to constrain his followers' demands before they pose a mortal threat to Iran's quixotic system of limited democracy constrained by Shiite clerics, who have ultimate authority.

His chances of success within the system would be far higher if he has backers among those clerics.....

In the clearest sign yet of a splintering among the ayatollahs, state media announced the arrests of Rafsanjani's relatives including his daughter Faezeh, a 46-year-old reformist politician vilified by hard-liners for her open support of Mousavi....

Rafsanjani heads the cleric-run Assembly of Experts, which can remove the supreme leader, the country's most powerful figure. He also chairs the Expediency Council, a body that arbitrates disputes between parliament and the unelected Guardian Council.

Rafsanjani and his family have been accused of corruption by Ahmadinejad. And the 75-year-old ayatollah was conspicuously absent Friday from an address by the country's supreme leader calling for national unity and siding with the president.

That fueled speculation that Rafsanjani, who has made no public comment since the election, may be working behind the scenes and favoring Mousavi.

The Assembly of Experts has not publicly reprimanded Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since he succeeded Islamic Revolution founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. But this crisis has rattled the once-untouchable stature of the supreme leader....

At least some lower-ranking clergy also appeared to have broken with the supreme leader. Photos posted by a moderate conservative news Web site showed what appeared to be mullahs in brown robes and white turbans protesting alongside a crowd of young men, some wearing the green shirts or sashes symbolizing Mousavi's self-described "Green Wave" movement....

Because as I said, the occupation is, and has always been, a consequence, not a cause of violence against the Jewish state.

 

So why do peace proposals insist on ending the occupation? And why build settlements if the purpose of the occupation is to 'prevent' said violence?

Please cite a source for Israeli Palestinian violence being greater between 1948 and 1967.

We probably should move this discussion somewhere else.

The Palestinians have never been Jordanians. An Arab League resolution specifically forbids the naturalization of Palestinians by any member state.

As for Israel ending the occupation, it comes back to the settlers and the fate of Jerusalem. I would hardly count the 08 Olmert initiative, given how Bibi scuttled the whole deal after he took power.

And if you pay attention, the Arab League has offered to recognized Israel, with the main point being the ending of the occupation (the right of return is just a throwaway canard). In that case, how is the occupation not a problem?

Again, we're probably better off discussing this in another subforum.
 
 
It's true there are two battles in Iran going on but a lot of the clerics are actually for some reform as well. Not "huge amounts of reform" But some reform.

If Iran were to get rid of every aspect of the Revolution right now, I'm willing to bet you that country would go into civil war. There's probably a third of the country that is strongly conservative and that 1/3 has a lot of power. I know that a lot of the Reformers really don't want another revolution. They'd rather see Iran reform within.

And always within the Revolution from the beginning was tensions about how democratic Iran should be. Not all the clerics wanted a theocracy even in the beginning. A theocracy is actually not normal to Shia Islam believe it or not....

Slow reform, with gradual more freedoms given and changes with the West (and with the Reformers they will have to do the thawing with the West slower than someone like Amj because of that 1/3 won't trust the Reformers. Although who knows about Amj wants better relations) and as the younger generation grows up more, the Reformers will eventually take complete power.
 
 
 
I know the regime can fall. That is not yet a free Iran, but starts to get closer. And if the regime indeed falls, I don't see it replaced by another authoritarian regime.

I'm not saying it will become a full fledged democracy like Sweden overnight, and yes, in this case I accept that I can be the victim of wishful thinking; still, Iranians among other things are a cultivated society, which seems to suggest that they can be able to produce some kind of consensual-based Government.

 

Finally, a few shreds of an actual argument. Lets see where they go.

First, lets make sure we are talking about the same thing. To me, a 'free Iran' is one where people have the basic set of freedoms that we enjoy in the west - speech, conscience, association & the ability to elect & remove governments. It needn't be Sweden, Indonesia or Turkey will do. This means clerics have no more power than in a nation like Israel (too much for most of us, but that is a debate for elsewhere). Does that sound like a reasonable definition of a 'free Iran' ? Short of that I don't see how the term has any meaning.

To me, the outcome of the election was not remotely about a 'free Iran'. It was about more freedom in some areas. it was about a power struggle between factions within Iran's actual power structure. it was perhaps about a few other things, but I don't see a 'free Iran' among them. Those engaged in the internal struggle are not looking at 'regime change', just a different set of faces in the halls of power.

It strikes me that the set of circumstances required for the regime to fall simply don't exist at this stage. There are a lot of brave, angry people demonsrating against a fraudulent result & perhaps even a stolen election (though no one really knows the latter). Some of these people undoubtedly want a 'free Iran'. Others simply want more freedoms. Yet others are perhaps just angry at the blatant manipulation of their vote.

I simply don't see how they are in a position to actually remove the regime. The best I can see at this point is that they might influence the outcome of a contest that could change some of the faces in power and permit a more free (to some degree) Iran. There remains a powerful popular constituency that supports the Islamic Republic in most respects. On side with them is the nation's power elite & I suspect enough people with guns to settle the issue if a genuine threat to the system emerges.

Indeed, as others have pointed out, it will probably take something akin to a civil war to get the mullahs out of power at this point. I'm not sure the likely outcome will be worth that price right now.

I am old enough to have a very clear memory of the events in Tiananmen square almost exactly 20 years ago. The way in which some outside commentators are projecting their own hopes & dreams about what people should be protesting for is eerily similar. Focussing on just those who say what we would like to hear or, worse, interpreting what they say completely out of context, won't do them any favours.

At this stage I think the most useful thing people in the west can do is express their support for an honest poll result, free speech & peaceful protest. All violence should be denounced & official intereference should be non-existent. In practical terms there is nothing the west can do on the ground except make things worse for the people we support.

I could be wrong about this. perhaps the protests will continue & expand to the point where the whole system will collapse. Perhaps in a week or a month there will be a dramatic change. What seems more likely is that these protests will be put down violently.

What effect might that have in the longer term? It could be that the clerics repilcate what happened in China - get smart, make some reforms & buy themselves another generation or two without relying too much on naked force. I am compelled to wonder, however, if the crudity of the vote manipulation, the openess of Khamenei's political involvement, the scale of infighting within the clerical & political elites & the scale of the resort to violence may contribute to a longer term erosion of legitmacy. Perhaps the people who WILL lead a free Iran are cutting their political teeth at the moment. I hope so.
 
 
It would be too good to be true and believed if the Guardian Council says they have found no irregularity. So finding some insignificant irregularities is what they say.

 Iran Council Finds Some Poll Irregularities 

 
22 June [WSJ] TEHRAN -- Iran's Guardian Council, a top review panel with responsibility for overseeing the June 12 presidential election, said it had uncovered some irregularities in the polls, finding the number of votes in 50 districts exceeded the number of voters....

The Guardian Council announcement, made Monday on state-run media, was the first admission by authorities of voter irregularities. But a council spokesman also said the irregularities were much less wide-spread than unsuccessful opposition candidates had alleged in recent complaints....

Mr. Kadkhodaei said that the affected votes could be as high as three million, but that it wouldn't noticeably affect the outcome of the election. An estimated 34 million to 36 million cast ballots. Mr. Kadkhodaei said, however, that the Guardian Council could recount the effected ballots if the candidates ask for it.....

The Guardian Council admission was the latest in several apparent concessions to opposition candidates, whose supporters have flooded the streets of Tehran and other cities in demonstrations against the polls. The Guardian Council has said it was probing more than 600 complaints in the polling made by candidates....

 Iran Council Finds Some Poll Irregularities 

 

Earlier in the week I was discussing the election with someone. I suggested that the announced investigation would indeed find a number of irregularities & that some local officials would probably get sacked. I also suggested that there was no way the scale of the irregularities would be enough to overturn the result.

I might now revise that to some senior officials getting sacked, but otherwise I think I'm on track. The investigation won't appease the truly committed protesters, but it might be enough to satisfy people who are angry & insulted, but not enough to want to change the government. These are some of the people who need to be on side for any serious change to take place here.

It won't be Turkey with its putchist generals nor Indonesia with its history of pro US dictatorship. Its even quite likely that it will stay an Islamic Republic with Mullahs in it. And we'll have to get over it.

Let's not forget that the Iranians made a Revolution to chase the western powers and their collaborators out of their country. I think they are still proud to have stood up against the US, and any plan to make Iranians "western friendly" is doomed to fail. Change, consensual change, will come only from whithin.

But I'm confident that the conservatives in the long run will feel compelled to make concessions about women's rights, freedom of expression and others, after what clearly appeared like a May 68 of the Iranian youth.
 
 
If it was ever a question over Iranian elections being fair in any way shape or form now should be point blank truth. The religious theocracy will never let go of controlling Iran nor its future. The US and all other nations should kick Iran out of the U.N. and give Israel the "green light" to act as she must. As you can see the people in Iran that want a better future will never have a voice so long as religious lying extremeists such as A-jad, Assahola and his followers still breathe the same air.

*One good part about this is the damage done to the theocracy will be perminent. They have proven that they fix elections, dont give their people their voice in voting, deny them lawfull assemby and right to protest election fraud and ofcoarse cut communications so that like minded voters cannot communicate nor assemble nor report on such topics.

Irans governemnt is a mockery of human desciency and certainly one that will soon bring them war and no doubt very diffacult times indeed. Throw them out of the U.N. and any other organization out there. Destroy their means to make nuclear weapons and isolate them.

We offered them an open hand however it does not seem they are willing to unclench their fist even when it comes to giving their own people what they should have had in the first place, rights and freedom of press,speech, lawfull assemby, the right to protest and fairly elected officials. I would hate like hell to live there knowing what the future will hold.
 
 
Oscar, I'm still trying to work out the point of this post. Perhaps Godot will turn up & tell me.

In the meantime I am left to muse over all the energy you put into convincing the board that Iran is a democracy last year. And I quote:

 
In case people forgot, Iran is a democracy.
 

(emphasis yours).

Good call.

 
It won't be Turkey with its putchist generals nor Indonesia with its history of pro US dictatorship. Its even quite likely that it will stay an Islamic Republic with Mullahs in it. And we'll have to get over it.

 

I was talking about Indonesia & Turkey in the present tense, and only to illustrate a point. Both are better examples of democracy than Iran has been under either the Shah or the mullahs. Bringing up their pasts to muddy the waters about Iran's present is utterly pointless. What we have to live with has nothing to do with what we might want.

 
Let's not forget that the Iranians made a Revolution to chase the western powers and their collaborators out of their country.

Remind me, what does this have to do with what I posted?

I am not interested in making Iran 'western friendly' (unless dropping holocaust denial & funding of terrorists counts). I am interested in it being free for its citizens. It is not. As for the Iranian Revolution, it was hijacked by religious fanatics who stole an aim curiously absent from your account - the desire to be free of a violent dictatorship. They will use violence to maitain that dictatorship, I hope it doesn't take violence to end it.

 
But I'm confident that the conservatives in the long run will feel compelled to make concessions about women's rights, freedom of expression and others, after what clearly appeared like a May 68 of the Iranian youth.
 

I'm happy that you are confident about this Oscar, but given your strike rate so far you'll excuse me if I seek more qualified opinions.

Hello, Israel attacks Iran the people will unite behind the government. They are a fiercly nationalistic. And please, it's not like democracy is so common in the Middle East. Perhaps the West should start talking to their own Middle Eastern allies about democracy, and Israel should stop its draconian settlement policies, before they speak to the Iranian government about democracy and human rights. And I don't even like the Iranian government.

But where is the talk for justice for Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Jordanians.

And I wouldn't assume that things won't change. There are huge fractures Iran already. A couple more years of Amj's failed polices... And well Khomeni is old as well.

They still have a different history. Its not because they are muslims that your comparison is any relevant.

This is rethoric for domestic consumption, Chavez does the same, Ahmadinedjad strucks something different which is extremely touchy with Israel that is the Holocaust. As for terrorism such Western allies as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia do/did the same.

 
I am interested in it being free for its citizens. It is not. As for the Iranian Revolution, it was hijacked by religious fanatics who stole an aim curiously absent from your account - the desire to be free of a violent dictatorship.

I am too. The difference is that I still believe that reforms can be carried out inside the current structure. The Islamic Republic is perfectible, just make the comparison with Saudi Arabia.

Irans economy wont survive a couple more years with A-jad at the helm, if you dont believe that statement then check Irans inflation rate as well as her unemployment rate and oil will be coming down once again. Make the people unhappy by denying them their god given rights to vote,speak and assemble and now you have a few million irate Iranians that have nothing better to do then stoke the removal of this bunch and create new ways to circumnavigate their communications cut offs and other measures for the next time around since they refuse to hold new elections. They are not dumb people and the theocracy will no doubt pay for this in the very near future as well as many nations that wont even talk to Iran now due to their leaders ignorance and corruption. Now consider this while Israel deals with another corrupt group tied to Irans leaders... Hezbolla. Dark days ahead indeed for the Iranian populice.
 
 
This is just an empty threat as these Revolutionary Guards are not up against an enemy from Iraq or another country.

What they are threatening to crush are their own countrymen, their younger brothers and sisters. There would not be enough prisons. If the crushing ends up with too many violent dead, the whole country would be stirred up into another revolution, a people revolution with the reformers providing the leadership.

 Iran's elite Guards threatens to crush protests 

 
3 hrs ago TEHRAN (AFP)  Iran's Revolutionary Guards warned on Monday it would crush further demonstrations over the disputed presidential election after the opposition defiantly vowed to press on with its protests.

The Guards -- an elite force set up to protect the Islamic republic in the wake of the 1979 revolution -- warned of a "decisive and revolutionary" riposte to any further unrest.

The warning came after state radio said at least 457 people had been detained in street clashes in Tehran on Saturday that left 10 people dead, bringing the overall toll from a week of violence to at least 17....

 Iran's elite Guards threatens to crush protests 

 

Merlin:

It is no empty threat, as you will see if the protestors continue to march en masse.

That they made this threat does indicate how serious the situation is.

According to latest reports, every intersection in downtown Tehran has police or paramilitary presense and the one modest demonstration that began to form today quickly fizzled after police used force to disperse it.

It appears the government is gaining the upper hand. The announcement by the Revolutionary Guard is piling on and may be enough to quiet things for a time.

The protestors have made their point, but they have yet to prove that the election was stolen. They are reacting from their own pre-election expectations. They expected to win; some polls said they would. But perhaps they did not consider that Iran is more than Tehran and the major cities.

Reforms are likely in the aftermath of the protests. Some heads will roll. Perhaps new, more fair election rules will emerge. One of the problems with the current polling system is that organizations behind candidates (parties) have no role in running polling stations. The government runs it all.

One thing is certain, A-jad's cockiness and knee-jerk condemnations of the west will no longer play as well in the Muslim world.

Obama made the right call. He took the moral high ground. Iran will seek to restore its image and co-opt domestic opposition by accepting his invitation to start a dialogue.

i think the biggest question now is, what part of government? what i am not yet clear about is the influence of the IGRC-- have they turned into a seperate power pole from the clerics, or are they still under the clerics' control?
 
 
IMO, We are looking straight down the barrel of a new generation dawning in Iran. This is a serious fissure in the glass ceiling the theocracy has created an no doubt they have lost respect and credibility from their very own people. They painted themselves into a corner that they will only escape through confrontation one way or the other. Bully for the Iranian people for protesting their god given rights and they are smart for ignoring the claims the West had anything to do with it, thats what the theocracy wants. Keep your eyes on the prize Iranians and demand full open honest elections and coverage. The world is watching and were all supporting you.  

Guess "W" really isint the worlds most hated man anymore eh?   ):P
 
 
 
JAD,

i think the biggest question now is, what part of government? what i am not yet clear about is the influence of the IGRC-- have they turned into a seperate power pole from the clerics, or are they still under the clerics' control?

 

My impression is that they are a quasi-business-military org, with emphasis on the latter, and that they are charged with protecting Islam--aka the state control by the clergy.
 
 
They're sort of like the Waffen SS and Iraqi Republican Guard for the ayatollahs, in that they're theoretically an ideologically oriented enforcer corps/private conventional army as opposed to the more professional, traditional armed forces.
 
 
In a statement according to Iran's state-run news agency, the Islamic Republic News Agency, Iran's Revolutionary Guard said "the guardians of the Islamic revolution and the courageous Basiji together with the security forces following the orders of the supreme leader and following him unquestioningly, are determined to act strongly to return peace and tranquility to society... and to clean the country of these plotters and hooligans."

Guardians? More like henchmen from a brand of people whose time in power is now limited. They should be tried for treason against the people of Iran!  

Peace and Tranquility? Take my rights away and see how much Peace and Tranquility I will convey upon to you.  

Plotters and Holligans? That must be the term the theocracy use for civilians who refuse to accept their rights being taken away by a regime foul with corruption, lies and deciept and murder their own people in the streets when called into question with proof of voter fraud and favoritism.  

Courageous? Dont make me laugh whats so courageous about beating and killing people because they are upset because the government blows and so does their theocracy. Courageous woman beaters is about all they are courageous about. Pussies!

The Iraqi Republican Guard was not an state-within-state, nor was the famed Waffen SS.

The best comparision IMHO is the SS as a whole, with the Basiji akin to SA.

I could be wrong about this. perhaps the protests will continue & expand to the point where the whole system will collapse. Perhaps in a week or a month there will be a dramatic change. What seems more likely is that these protests will be put down violently.

What effect might that have in the longer term? It could be that the clerics repilcate what happened in China - get smart, make some reforms & buy themselves another generation or two without relying too much on naked force. I am compelled to wonder, however, if the crudity of the vote manipulation, the openess of Khamenei's political involvement, the scale of infighting within the clerical & political elites & the scale of e may contribute to a longer term erosion of legitmacy. Perthe resort to violenchaps the people who WILL lead a free Iran are cutting their political teeth at the moment. I hope so.
 

I think you are wrong. I think there is a real possibility the regime can fall.

Also: Freedom has no measure.

Ok, Ok....if you want me to get realistic, I'll say this is no Tienanmen and no China, there is a chance here as you acknowledge.

And in any case, never forget the regime is the violence by definition, that much should be clear even for radical multicultis. Otherwise we would be the cause of helpless laughter among the ayatollahs. ("They fell for it? But it's too easy!")

But yes, the "west" should just make clear where it stands without being emphatic, I think Iranian people are quite aware of what they are going through.

Bottom line is I think this will end with a military dictatorship or with some kind of wonderful democracy.

I fervently hope is a free Iran and that it doesn't take a civil war to decide it.
 
 
IMO, The regime wont fall, It has gotten bad but not bad enough for that to happen. If it did the forces around them would in all countries be on their toes no doubt. It is a true shame that it wont fall without massive life loss to the Iranians. Guess we shall see and hope for the best and keep supporting them through media and web. Tough choice not to interfere when you see what is happening to them. A moral our country constantly faces with all we come into contact with.  
 
 
 
Very good short definition, actually.

 

Except you have all of those freedoms in prison too.

Well, Dreadnought, weren't you braggin' about Manifest Destiny and all the rest of it?

You got it. The US is the leader of the free world, so now, what are you going to do about it?
 
 
 
Except you have all of those freedoms in prison too.

 

No. When you are in prison you cannot run for an election. At least in the Spanish legal system.

As mentioned previous we cannot interfere. To do so would throw the ME into caos and our troops in the surrounding areas in danger. The best we can do is use politics and support of the people with the help of allies otherwise you risk the innocent that will fall under the boot but on a much larger scale. Iran is going to be ran be religion maybe not A-Jad but even the other fellow wont give in on the nuclear card.  

There is still alot to come out of this, we just have to be cautious as we will be blamed none the less as A-jad and the Assahola already have done. Do we agree with whats going on? Absolutely not and never will.

lol, idk what romanian prisons are, but i can assure you freedom would be the last thing on your mind in us and russian prisons.
why don,t you try yourself, get there and start exsercising your freedom of speech, movement, assosiation..ect. you wont last long, or you will as a someones sex toy.

The US will be blamed if it does, and damned if doesn't. Don't worry about that: just NEVER apologize for your values, and you'll be alright.

By the way, I'm myself a kind of weird neocon I guess, but I disagree with all the neocons and hawks who are asking Obama a stronger stance at this moment. I don't think he is doing bad. And also, President Obama is green but he is not a bad guy, he is a good guy. So don't be harsh on him, give him a break.
 
 
 
No. When you are in prison you cannot run for an election. At least in the Spanish legal system.

 

Same here. But most of them can vote and thus elect and remove governments.

An argument in favor of open societies.

Well understood that a set of formal freedoms doesn't mean you are free. Even in the best society one has to fight for freedom every damn day. But at least you don't waste the fight against a black-robed clown or some other ridiculously oppressive figure.
 
 
 
Err...You think you'll get away with that comment because we'll never be totally sure who really won at this election?

 

No, I think I'll get away with it because it is now clearer than ever that Iran is not a democracy. If you still don't see that then I have overestimated you.

 
They still have a different history. Its not because they are muslims that your comparison is any relevant.
 

I simply chose two useful examples of non-western nations that meet the definition of 'free'. Their past is irrelevant to that definition.

 
This is rethoric for domestic consumption, Chavez does the same, Ahmadinedjad strucks something different which is extremely touchy with Israel that is the Holocaust. As for terrorism such Western allies as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia do/did the same.
 

Here's a tip for you sparky, I'm not Israeli and holocaust denial is pretty damn touchy for me. I don't care who the audience is or why. When the person doing it has the title 'President' and hosts a conference of likeminded cretins I assume a) he means it; and b) he is not qualified to stand for the local school board.

Try to stay on topic Oscar, pulling in SA or Pakistan is yet another muddying exercise.

 
I am too. The difference is that I still believe that reforms can be carried out inside the current structure. The Islamic Republic is perfectible, just make the comparison with Saudi Arabia.
 

Nice to finally have you on board, sort of. You are right, we do differ. I don't believe Iran can be free under a system where power ultimately rests in the hands of a few clerics. Still, given that you believe that the system as it stands is a democracy I have no doubt that you do.

 
My strike record tells me you're wrong and your little sneering doesn't help prove your point.
 

Your strike rate on Iran sucks Oscar, and all the muddying & tapdancing in the world won't change that. You are right, the sneering doesn't prove my point, simple observation of events is doing just fine.

Castellano,

Most of this makes no sense to me (the bits in italics). I'm not really sure what you were trying to say, but it didn't come out in a coherent manner.

As for the rest, I think we are hoping for roughly the same thing but disagree on how likely it is. I hope you are correct, but I seriously doubt you are.
 
 
 
This picture is published in BBC shows who is actually destroying/vandalizing private and public properties to give a bad name to opposition.
I wonder if this ancient trick still works or not.

Bigfella ;

At last you engage me in a conversation, you elaborate a reasoned argument, and I babble a bunch of incoherent stuff as a reply.

I just meant to say that I think something has broken irreparably for the regime; and for that reason I see either a military dictatorship or some kind of real democracy coming out this. I dont see half measures.

Anyway, mine is a very uninformed opinion.
 
 
 
It is no empty threat, as you will see if the protestors continue to march en masse....

 

Of course, with no doubt, the Revolutionary Guard can militarily crush the protesters. They have been fighting the large Iraq army fiercely in the 1980s. As I said they are now not fighting an enemy army from another country.

It would now be a political suicide for the Supreme Leader's ruling elite if too many of their own protesting citizens are violently killed in front of the broadcasting mobile phone cameras.

I think they realize this. Over so many days of bloody protests, the number of people killed is kept low, officially at about 17.

The Ayatollah Rafsanjani controled council (of hand forgot the name) has the power to remove the Supreme Leader.

We are talking about present day Iran with a high proportion of educated middle class. Myanmar a few years ago, and China in Mao's time are different. Parallel cannot and should not be drawn.

To paraphrase Stalin and Andrew Jackson

How many troops does the Council of Experts have? And let the Council enforce that decision themselves. I've been predicting a coup by the guards for some time. What I failed to account for what Khamenei siding with the guards due to a rivalry with Rafasajani and Montezeri.
 
 
how honest election can bee? forget it !

Anyway, mine is a very uninformed opinion.
 

Truth is I don't think any of us really know what is happening, we just stumble onto the occasional insight more or less by accident.

I agree that something is broken here and I agree that some sort of military dictatorship is one possible outcome - A-jad, Khamenei & the Revolutionary guards (and perhaps the army) taking power with such hangers on as they have.

Where we disagree is the other possibility. If Khamenei & A-jad fail I suspect the power brokers in the short term will be other clerics. They won't be looking for a genuine democracy, they will be looking at a way to keep the other side at bay without starting a war. My bet is that for the moment they will stick with something that looks like the existing structure, but where the vote actually means something (as opposed to now, where it effectively means nothing). I can definately see this sort of model evolving into a genuine democracy in time, but it won't start that way.

I think the Islamic Republic still has too large a genuine costituency to risk junking it, and I suspect that enough of the demonstrators will be content with new & fair elections and more freedom. At this stage (and we don't yet know if we are nearer the beginning or end of this) I'm not sure the constituency for a complete overthrow is big enough or powerful enough to do it.

Anyway, we are all just guessing here.
 
 
It is amazing what is happening in Iran. I hope the underdogs overcome the regime. Then it will validate the power of new technology and power of the internet to overcome an antiquated system of government.
 
 
The polls were rigged, no doubt of that. That, however gives no excuse to USA and UK to interfere in Iran. The fact that Ahmadinejad does not fawn over the west and in fact hates the west is no excuse for western governments to try and have him overthrown. Just let Iran be. Iranians will find a way out of the mess sooner or later without American or British help.
 
 
Neda has become the icon of protesters. It is expected that the regime would ban the memorials to her. I think the protesters will still defiantly proceed with these memorials.

 Iran bans memorials for 'Angel of Freedom' 

 
Iran's regime has banned memorials for a young woman whose death has become the focal point of protests against the clerical regime.

22 June [Telegraph] Neda Agha Soltan, 27, was named the Angel of Freedom after a video appearing to show her being shot by a government sniper was posted on the internet.

The graphic scenes show Neda  her name means "the call"  walking with her father among demonstrators before she is seen lying on the ground covered in blood as attempts are made to save her life.

The video, which was posted online on Saturday and has been view hundreds of thousands of times, appears to shows blood pouring from the nose and mouth of Neda as she lies on a street in Tehran.

Bystanders desperately tend to the woman who wears jeans, a black jacket and an Islamic headscarf. Her eyes seem to be rolled back as blood spreads across her face. People around her scream and a white haired man desperately tells her: "Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid!"

Online posters of the woman have emerged, including one modelled on a prominent image of Barack Obama during the US presidential campaign.

There has been speculation that the image will come to symbolise the protest in the same way as that of the unnamed man standing in front of a tank in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and the summary execution of a Vietnamese Communist prisoner by Colonel Nugyen Ngoc Loan in 1968....

I must have missed something here, but I thought nothing was basically what Britain & the UK were doing. In fact, Obama has been criticized by some in the US for doing too little.

Security forces have arrested an armed man involved in Saturday's riots, the office said, adding that security and intelligence officials are currently probing into the identity of the individual whose photo was published and broadcast by news agencies. "

end of humour..
But seriously how do the people in Iran actually swallow all this?
Or is this a simple case of expelling western press so they dont report the truth. Also is it a simple case of add enough fact to your fiction and make it big enough often enough everyone might just swallow it hook line and sinker.

What is my take: Well I do think Obama has approach the whole thing correctly. Though there may have been too much western media hype hoping that Mousavi would win. That was sort of handing Ahmadinejad the vote as he did use it against his opposition.

Where the protest goes is going to be heavily dependent on its leadership, which at present is somewhat non existent as far as linking everything together. Though I have a suspicion there was no real leadership from the start.
Lack of leadership will just allow the current regime to squash this whole thing.
The outcome will not be useful for any friendly moves for Obama, though it will also leave a shaken and weakened cleric control government in Tehran. It may has strengthened the role of Ahmadinejad and that of the Revolutionary Guard and the status if the Basij.
 
 
They want to keep people at home so fine, stay at home. Don't give them more excuse to kill people. Stop making protest, make strike. Don't go to work. Leave the factories, oil fields, public offices and universities for those barbarians Basij and Revolution Guard to do the job. Without educated people, let's see how they survive.

That the Iranians elected a cretin is not exactly breaking news. But I don't consider his stupidity as a threat to world peace.

 
Nice to finally have you on board, sort of. You are right, we do differ. I don't believe Iran can be free under a system where power ultimately rests in the hands of a few clerics. Still, given that you believe that the system as it stands is a democracy I have no doubt that you do.
 

If you are so eager to dig you should look where I said that Iran was a free and open democracy. Democracies can be totalitarian, Germany comes to mind, a people wilfully voting for a governement that will dramatically curtail freedoms.

There can be populist democracies like Venezuela where Chavez persecutes its opponents, suppress dissents and still stays popular among the majority of its, generally poor, constituents and gets re elected.

Democracy is a process, its neutral.

Then, you have liberal democracy where you enjoy the different freedoms, plus the power to elect your governement. Singapore is not a democracy but one could say Singaporeans enjoy more freedom than the average Venezuelian. Freedom and democracy are not one and the same thing. Well at least I tried to explain that to you.

 
Your strike rate on Iran sucks Oscar, and all the muddying & tapdancing in the world won't change that. You are right, the sneering doesn't prove my point, simple observation of events is doing just fine.
 

Boohoo Bigfella this is an opinion board you may radically not agree but unless you prove me that you're specialised in Iranian history this is still a discusion between amateurs, and your opinion sucks. See? I can say it too  
 
 
I believe the election was not rigged, and was fair i support Amadinejad because he will stand up to the Americans and keep the country pure.
 
 
Oscar I am really surprised, what exactly do you consider a threat to world peace? A country that is striving for nuclear weapons that has leaders that deny the holocaust happened makes for a very dangerous situation. It is not a matter of stupidity it is more online with psychosis. The reason that MAD worked during the Cold War was because the leaders understood just how terrible a nuclear exchange would be. Do you honestly believe that any leader of a country that denies the mass execution of a group of people would have any qualms exterminating part of the worlds population?

IMO, I agree as well that the President should press Iran to give her people what they were already born with but seem to be denied when the power vacuum gets turned on and the theocracy is in decline. I would hope that he would press Iran much harder then what he is at present but only time will tell.

Congratulations on sucking all the meaning out of the term 'democracy' Oscar. At least I now understand why you throw it around so freely.

Oh, and congratulations on yet more red herrings - where did I say A-jad was a threat to world peace? Try at least one post where you simply stick to the issue at hand, it will be a nice change.

BadKharma,

Much as it pains me, I have to agree with Oscar. A-jad is nasty, loudmouthed, deeply offensive & an embarrasment, but don't get sucked into the whole "he's going to nuke Israel" schtick. It is BS. Even if he did control nukes (in itself unlikely) I can't see any evidence he'll use them. He & the others who run Iran have a clear idea of what will happen if they nuke Israel - they all die. End of story. End of Iran. I can't think of a single nation in history that has undertaken an action knowing it will end in its destruction (lots of them should have known, but that is different).

Out of interest, take a look at the region & take a look at the nations that actually have a track record of attacking their neighbours over the past 30 years. Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan & Syria all have form, while Israel is a serial offender. Iran certainly supports terrorists, but that is something of a regional cottage industry (Afghanistan Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, the US, Saudi Arabia, probably Jordan & definately Israel have all done this within recent memory). It doesn't have a record of directly attacking or invading its neighbours.

A-jad is a threat to other Iranians. He is something of a threat to regional stability (though not the largest). He is not a threat to world peace.
 
 
 
IMO, I agree as well that the President should press Iran to give her people what they were already born with but seem to be denied when the power vacuum gets turned on and the theocracy is in decline. I would hope that he would press Iran much harder then what he is at present but only time will tell.

 

Dread,

What can he realistically do that will actually achieve this end? How does he press iran in a way that achieves this?

Believe it or not, there is a fair bit of underlying dislike for US meddling, even among those Iranians who want more freedom. They have long memories & not especially fond ones of US involvement in their nation. Overt US support for their cause is going to do more harm than good. Obama is doing a good job by sticking to support for principle & the rule of law. As long as the US is hands off the rhetoric of Khamenei & A-jad looks hollow. Get directly involved & it becomes real - poof goes a big chunk of support for the protests.
 
 
Yeah, They are as finicky as Iraqi's but its as well and good.

We knew the elections would be a sham, and pretty stupidly they telegraphed it to the world in their own way in which they think the West is stupid enough to buy their reasonings and excuses. A-jad and the Assahola are evil men with evil means at their disposal. (They began arresting supporting clerics families becuase they were going to support the other fellow) They are weakened as leadership and it will be surprising if any civilized nation takes their word as truth. The cloak is lifted and the truth exposed for what it is.

Dictatorship supported by extremeist theocracy but perhaps maybe one day the Iranian people will get their share or democracy and fair elections and maybe even perhaps some rights that the rest of the civilized world enjoys. Until then A-jad and the assahola can look forward to more sanctions and confrontation while having to check over their shoulder on the Iranian people they really pissed off.

Enjoy running that country into the ground A-jad, we will be waiting.
 
 
Hi all,

Joining a bit late in this long yet interesting thread. Here's my take...

Do you believe the vote was rigged, and if so, by enough to change the outcome?

To the first part, well votes are rigged all over the world, be it the US or Pakistan or Iran. So yes the votes would have been rigged in this election as well.

The question is that would the rigging have affected the outcome allowing Ahmadinejad a victory, the answer can be a yes or no.

I'll explain the "no" first. While the West perceives Ahmadinejad as a threat, for many in the Muslim world he epitomises the sole resistance to the "West". There are very few Muslim countries that will stand up against the western states. So he does have support in his Iran (no matter how much we might like to believe otherwise) and in other countries.

Do you believe that the protests will develop into something more, such as regime change or reform of the Iranian system?

Given the current block on the flow of information (television, radio, internet), it is unlikely. The protesters have to find a way to organise themselves and come out on the streets and do so even though they are being threatened with "bloodshed" by the state itself. It's a test of resilience here.

The protesters also have to promote "their" cause. Why are they fighting for a regime change: the average Iranian  who is not university educated, does not use internet, does not know what Twitter  has to be told of the reasons for the cause and its effect. Merely stating that the US is unhappy with the current regime will not be enough to change allegiances.

Thirdly, Iran saw a popular revolution in 1979 and this is a continuation of the policies of the then instated regime. Regime change  probably yes. Reforming the Iranian system  probably not.

Do you have any stories to share about what it taking place inside Iran today?
Not as yet. Though I do have an Iranian friend and he was the one who explained that while his family has migrated to Pakistan because his father could not stand the religious conservatism and state monopoly post-1979, his uncles and aunts did not agree and have stayed in Iran since.

Will get back with a better response later.
 
 
Pluto, There is no doubt they were rigged it not even a question, the numbers dont even come close to matching the population in the voting areas.

A-jad, the Assahola and their minions were busy arresting supporting clerics familes that were supporting A-jads rival.

Millions of hand written votes were counted with 2-1/2 hours when modern technology cannot even do that here in the same time frame electronically. So what does that tell you?

Voting offices were closed down as people were still lining up to vote.

*It was the poorest excuse of an election the world has ever seen. Just goes to show you that Iran as long as ruled by Assahola and A-jad and the minions will never change no matter how much you reach an open hand in their direction they will always remain a closed fist. We should stop wasting our time and let Israel finish this game once and for all with the worlds support and continue to choke them via sanctions and the U.N. not recognize them until they can prove that can hold fair elections.
 
 
 
Oscar I am really surprised, what exactly do you consider a threat to world peace? A country that is striving for nuclear weapons that has leaders that deny the holocaust happened makes for a very dangerous situation.

Do you honestly believe that any leader of a country that denies the mass execution of a group of people would have any qualms exterminating part of the worlds population?

 

If Iran (note - Iran, not Ahmedinejad) does get nuclear weapons, it won't be to destroy Israel and themselves in the process. It would, in all probability be used as a deterrence against over-aggressive action. Would it create some unrest in the Middle East ? Sure.
Tell me though, why is it that you have a problem with Iran having nuclear weapons, but not Pakistan ? Or China ?

 
We knew the elections would be a sham, and pretty stupidly they telegraphed it to the world in their own way in which they think the West is stupid enough to buy their reasonings and excuses.

 

It doesn't look like they care very much about what the West has to say about them. And more importantly, why should it ?
 
 
Tell me though, why is it that you have a problem with Iran having nuclear weapons, but not Pakistan ? Or China ?

*Because Pakistans nukes are somewhat controlled by the Chinese and neither of the two pose a radical religious type threat that Iran does.

*I think at this point nobody cares as to the Iranian government, The people after being bent over probably harbor some serious feelings towards the government at this point and made clear the point that Iran is nothing more then a dictatorship controlled by religious theocracy. In other words radical and untrustworthy. Not the people, the government so this also plays bad for their offshhots such as Hezbollah and Hamas and a few others.

*Its not just the West, and it will pay dividends long into the future everytime A-jad opens his mouth. The world knows what will come out of it and blow it off and Iran will remain in isolation from the outside world. It wont get nuclear weapons though. The world is trying to coax her away from this but in the end and if it comes to it I doubt sanctions will be the road that is chosen to bring the matter to end. Syria learned this lesson not long ago and unveiled who she was dealing with reactor wise.
 
 
I thought it would be in their interest to have the President inauguration early, not July 26 to Aug 19.

 Iran's Guardian Council readies timetable for Ahmadinejad inauguration amid protests 

 
23 June [NYDaily] Iran's top election authority on Tuesday ruled out major voting fraud in the disputed presidential election and said President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would be sworn in for a second term between July 26 and August 19.....
 
 
 
 
*Because Pakistans nukes are somewhat controlled by the Chinese and neither of the two pose a radical religious type threat that Iran does.

 

If Pakistan wanted to launch a nuclear missile at New Delhi in the event of a conflict, it would not have to take China's permission (Also, why would China hesitate if indeed what you're saying is correct).
As far as the radical religious threat goes - the only difference is that Iran funds terror against Israel and Pakistan funds terror against India.

1. Exactly my point. I don't think trying to convince America/West that their elections were fair is top on their priority list right now.

2. There we disagree. If Iran wants nuclear weapons, it will get them. Launching a war against Iran right now would be a horrible idea, which is why it hasn't been done so far. Short of doing so, you can only slow down their nuclear programme, not kill it.
 
 
I think beside the nuclear and terrorist matter, we should care a little bit about Persian people. Why they (most of population, I believe) don't like their government and why we should help them?
 
 
1. Exactly my point. I don't think trying to convince America/West that their elections were fair is top on their priority list right now.

The whole point is that it is not only the West. All nations that were on the fence about sanctions and the use of force are now convinced that Iran will be ran by a extremeist religious theocracy and a dictator that does not respect the rights of anyone including the very basic rights of their own people and that they will stop at nothing to retain a deathgrip on the country. This will force other countries that do repect free elections, voters rights among other things to view Iran with distain and suspect at every move she makes and every word that comes from A-jad's mouth. Basically in attempting to defraud his own people his rhetoric about the West will now fall upon deaf ears since the people focus will be on the plight of the good people in Iran.

Did'nt cost us a thing and well unfortunately, it did require shots to be fired at a completely helpless protesting crowd. Pity the dead for they only wanted what many take for grantit here in the West and curse anyone who attempts to remove those basic human rights by force or defraud.

2. There we disagree. If Iran wants nuclear weapons, it will get them. Launching a war against Iran right now would be a horrible idea, which is why it hasn't been done so far. Short of doing so, you can only slow down their nuclear programme, not kill it.

*Do you honestly think that the US AND ALL ALLIES will allow Iran to have nuclear weapons to point at Iraq and Allied forces not to mention the tens of billions of dollars invested in Iraq and a possible monopoly on the Straits of Hormuz by threatenting the use of Nuclear weapons? On top of that the Israeli concerns over the very same? I see disappointment on Irans end.  
 
 
 
A-jad is nasty, loudmouthed, deeply offensive & an embarrasment, but don't get sucked into the whole "he's going to nuke Israel" schtick. It is BS. Even if he did control nukes (in itself unlikely) I can't see any evidence he'll use them. He & the others who run Iran have a clear idea of what will happen if they nuke Israel - they all die. End of story. End of Iran. I can't think of a single nation in history that has undertaken an action knowing it will end in its destruction (lots of them should have known, but that is different).

 

It is entirely logical that you cannot find any "evidence he'll use them" because future events cannot be proved. It is impossible by definition.

The observation that no nation has ever committed suicide is somewhat valid and relevant, but it is also arguable, and most significantly, it is explicitly denied by different figures of the regime, who have stated in so many words that MAD doesn't concern them - History has provided plenty of "evidence" about the the folly of not taking people at their own words.

There is a similar negligence in your characterization of A-jad. Not only is he nasty, loudmouthed, deeply offensive & embarrasing. He is also positively insane. He thinks that when he talks to the UN assembly people can't blink for 30 minutes. And if he has doubts, he goes to a well to listen to a voice for consultation.

That said, I think it is unlikely that Iran would attack Israel with nuclear weapons. But I'm absolutely sure that it would be foolish to discard the possibility.

Because there is an additional, even more troublesome point: the regime's policy on this issue is driven by the belief that once and for all a Persian, Shiite strain of Islam can recapture age old honor and prestige long denied by the Arabs and Sunnites, by being the people and the sect that are finally willing to end the Zionist entity.

And some within the Iranian leadership would be willing as they themselves have pointed out, to lose several million people which they feel they could afford with the assurance that Israel would be gone.

 
Out of interest, take a look at the region & take a look at the nations that actually have a track record of attacking their neighbours over the past 30 years. Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan & Syria all have form, while Israel is a serial offender.
 

My English is far from perfect. Did I understand you correctly and you just stated that Israel has attacked anybody in the last 30 years or in its entire History for that matter?

Because if that is the case it is completely false. A lie that you should retract immediately, lest your knowledge of History be totally discredited.

 
Iran certainly supports terrorists, but that is something of a regional cottage industry (Afghanistan Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, the US, Saudi Arabia, probably Jordan & definately Israel have all done this within recent memory). It doesn't have a record of directly attacking or invading its neighbours.
 

Amazing. Now the US and Israel "definitely" support terrorists.

And yes, is true the regime uses proxies to attack its neighbors. Like in Lebanon 2006. I suppose that saves their face, since it is a method of waging War but is not "directly attacking or invading its neighbours", no?

 
A-jad is a threat to other Iranians. He is something of a threat to regional stability (though not the largest). He is not a threat to world peace.
 

You are completely wrong. If the brave Iranian people don't save the day, there is going to be a crisis as predictable and grave as 1938, and you don't even suspect it.

I am amazed. Really.
 
 
This whole thing is going to get very complicated...............
 
 
 
*Do you honestly think that the US AND ALL ALLIES will allow Iran to have nuclear weapons to point at Iraq and Allied forces not to mention the tens of billions of dollars invested in Iraq and a possible monopoly on the Straits of Hormuz by threatenting the use of Nuclear weapons?

Sooner or later, the equation will change. The West is clinging on to the Mid East on the support of a few dictators, which, like the Shah, are prone to be taken down by the people sooner or later. I see Iran as the biggest emerging power, and even if it goes nuclear, it wont be such a bad thing, as long as the Iranian people find the power to rule their country, rather than being ruled themselves. Nuclear power coming into the region is inevitable.

Tronic, Nuclear arms have been in the region for some time. Although the ones that have them do not call for the destruction of others based upon race or any other matter. Iran may one day get this power but in all hopes by then will not be ruled by some insane religious theocracy that is bent on the destruction of another due to religious beliefs. It is unhuman to imagine such a regime with that kind of power to wield over some made up relious edict. If Iran does aquire that power there are many that would call for Iraq to be armed as well to protect herself.

These men in power in Iran are dam sure not worthy of wielding such power as they act like spoiled children with a chip on their shoulders and could never be trusted. Not now not ever. If the people overthrew them and formed a more stable government with more sound thought and vision then perhaps in time. But I dont forsee that so long as that regime and anyone that could fill the vaccum if they were overthrown but yet still maintained that way of thinking was still alive. These are evil men that cannot wait to be able to project their religious edicts across their borders and at their neighbors including Israel. Destroy the regime, Basij, Hezbollah, Hamas and all other factions and now we are making progress. Until then deny them nuclear weapons at all costs because if we dont they will bring about the destruction of those weaker then themselves with some kind of twisted religious reasoning. All in the name of pride. Evil men.

I think the regime will loose its monopoly on good propoganda material if Israel cease to exist. The Shia strain of Islam has always been about being the opressed. In this case, opressed by the imperialist and zionist.

Take out Israel and U.S. from the equation, than the regime will have a hard time sellings its propoganda to middle easterners.

In other words, they need to be the underdog - aspiring to go to the top - not the champion who goes to the top.
 
 
how do you think us and israel should be taken out from equation??
 
 
 
I believe the election was not rigged, and was fair i support Amadinejad because he will stand up to the Americans and keep the country pure.

 

Welcome to the board. It would be good if you introduced yourself as all new members do.

Amadinejad supporters are welcome to speak openly here, even though the same may not be said of his opponents who wish to speak openly in Iran.

As for whether elections were rigged, of course no one outside of the Iranian government knows for certain. However, the Council of Guardans has reported irregularities in 50 election districts where the number of votes cast exceeded the number of registered voters. This may not mean anything since Iranians can vote wherever they wish.

Today, the Supreme Leader extended the time for reporting election irregularities by 5 days. Any and all indications of vote fraud cast doubt on the entire election.

I doubt that Amadinejad is standing up to America to keep Iran pure. He's a wily politician playing on the fierce nationalism of Iranians who strongly resent any outside interference in their nation's internal affairs.

In any case, it would be interesting to hear your reasoning why the elections were not rigged. How is Iran better off with Amadinejad as president and what exactly do you mean by a "pure" Iran?
 
 
 
I believe the election was not rigged, and was fair i support Amadinejad because he will stand up to the Americans and keep the country pure.

 

Pure of what? Those who want their voice to be heard and not follow a hitler wannabe loon and a bunch of power hungry charlatans who defame the word of God for their own end? They're not going to keep anything pure, they're going to end up starting a war you have no chance of winning and getting a lot of your countrymen killed.
 
 
What does this means? Does it mean the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader are softeningly adjusting their announced positions?

 TV: Iran's supreme leader agrees to extend vote probe deadline 

 
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah AliKhamenei has agreed to extend the deadline for the probe into the complaints over the country's presidential election, Iran's Press TV reported Tuesday.

Khamenei accepted the Guardian Council's request to extend by five days the deadline for the investigation into the complaints over vote irregularities, Press TV said.

In a letter to the supreme leader, the election watchdog has asked for more time to remove any ambiguity over the disputed election.

Local daily Tehran Times has reported that the Guardian Council would announce its final position on the complaints about the election results on Wednesday.

Earlier Tuesday, Press TV quoted Guardian Council spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaii as saying that the Council has rejected any annulment of the election results because it had found no major irregularities in the election.....
 
 
 
Last night a friend who follows these things said that Iran's supreme leader Khamenei was ill with lung cancer and was poised to name his son as supreme leader. I said impossible. The supreme leader is chosen by the Assembly of Experts. So, to settle the dispute she called an Iranian woman who lives in Washington. The woman confirmed that I was right...technically, but that in the past, the man chosen for the position--Khamenei is only the second to hold it--would need the full backing of the Revolutionary Guard, and that Khamenei 's son has. The woman said he is as hardline as they come and would tolerate no dissent.

As for Khamenei health, it's been up and down. After a bout of illness not oo long ago, people who saw hiim up close said he looked poorly. Who knows, he's only 8 days older than me and I am still fighting off young chicks and climbing roofs.   )

 
Mojtaba Khamenei: gatekeeper to Iran's supreme leader

Julian Borger The Guardian, Monday 22 June 2009

Iran's supreme leader's second son, Mojtaba Khamenei, has emerged as one of the driving forces behind the *government's crackdown, diplomats and observers said.

Mojtaba is an ally of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the disputed president, and was credited with winning his father's endorsement for the then Tehran mayor in the 2005 elections, leading to Ahmadinejad's shock second round victory.

Mojtaba is an austere figure, *generally seen as more hardline than his father and has become a gatekeeper for access to the beit-e-rahbari, the supreme leader's home, and the supreme leader himself.

According to some Iran analysts, Khamenei, 70, is manoeuvring to position his son as his successor.

Formally, the position is supposed to be awarded by the assembly of experts, an elected group of clerics led by the most powerful rival to Khamenei and Ahmadinejad, Hashemi Rafsanjani.

But the first supreme leader, *Ruhollah Khomeini, had a powerful say on who his successor should be.

Khamenei has been increasingly described in the official media as the "Ali of our times", a reference to Ali, the Shia imam who passed on the position to his son Hassan.

"There has been a lot of talk lately that this is all about Mojtaba and the succession," said Ali Ansari, an Iran analyst at St Andrews University.

"He may be securing the position for the long term, and protecting it. The argument is that he is protecting his future."

If this is correct, then Iran is about to get another shah in all but name. Also what if the Council of Experts refuse? Will the Guard place him on the throne?

Something tells me they won't. It smacks too much of a dynasty.
 
 
So he wants to be the next Kim Il Sung?

Good luck with that. Even if he manages to get the undivided support of the Guards, the other clerics won't stand for it and they can go to the Artesh (the Army, which outnumbers the Guards several times over) and also call a general strike.
 
 
This takes the cake.

Charged 'Bullet Fee'

By FRANK CARNEVALE
(MYFOX NATIONAL) - Amidst the demonstrations over the recent Iranian presidential election, one family in Tehran is mourning the loss of their 19-year-old son. Details remain unclear, but the family believes that Kaveh Alipour was caught in gun crossfire. The family was struck with another blow, though, when they were told that they would have to pay a "bullet fee" to claim their son.

The Wall Street Journal writes that "Upon learning of his son's death, the elder Mr. Alipour was told the family had to pay an equivalent of $3,000 as a "bullet fee" a fee for the bullet used by security forcesbefore taking the body back, relatives said."

The family says that he was not part of the demonstrations and was not politically active.

The family did not have the $3,000 to pay the officials, but were able to talk morgue officials into waiving the fee provided they did not hold a funeral or burial in Tehran. Kaveh Alipour's body was taken to another city where there is family.

At least 17 have been killed in the protests in the last week. On Monday riot police attacked hundreds of demonstrators with tear gas and fired live bullets in the air to disperse a rally in central Tehran.

The news of one woman's death, now identified as Neda Agha Soltan, has has spread worldwide and become a symbol and icon for the demonstrators.

I agree with your point that this regime should certainly not be allowed to wield nuclear weapons, but I disagree that they would actually be stupid enough to use them. Using nuclear weapons will be like pressing the self-destruct button, and despite the fiery speeches, I really doubt Irani regime is that stupid. What nuclear weapons can do for Iran are greatly increase its stature in the Middle East and make it a much bigger player giving it far more leverage in Mid-Eastern affairs. And here, I agree that this current regime has shown great immaturity and doesn't deserve that extra say in regional matters.

And as for Iraq making a case for nuclear weapons, well, its a dominos affect which started from 1945. Following the threat perceptions, the chips fell from US>Soviets>Chinese>Indians>Pakistanis>Israelis>pos sibly Iranis, each going nuclear due to their rival. Its a continuous chain, and everytime a new country goes nuclear, another one can make a case to go nuclear aswell.

Likewise history has shown the folly of misjudging people's intentions & overreacting. The 'history teaches' game cuts both ways.

 
There is a similar negligence in your characterization of A-jad. Not only is he nasty, loudmouthed, deeply offensive & embarrasing. He is also positively insane. He thinks that when he talks to the UN assembly people can't blink for 30 minutes. And if he has doubts, he goes to a well to listen to a voice for consultation.
 

We have fascinating ways of judging 'sanity'.

What if I told you that powerful people in this world took their advice from an invisible being, believed they were living in the last days of mankind, believed that they would live to see the 'chosen' magically dissappear from the earth (to heaven) and that the existence of the state of Israel fulfils a thousands year old prophecy that will usher in this apocalypse. Personally I would judge them as babbling lunatics, yet I'm betting more than one has occupied a senior government or military position in America during the past 30 years.

We pick and choose our 'sanities' for convenience.

 
That said, I think it is unlikely that Iran would attack Israel with nuclear weapons. But I'm absolutely sure that it would be foolish to discard the possibility.
 

It would likewise be foolish to act on the assumption that it is inevitable, which is what the 'threat to world peace' assumption is all about.

 
Because there is an additional, even more troublesome point: the regime's policy on this issue is driven by the belief that once and for all a Persian, Shiite strain of Islam can recapture age old honor and prestige long denied by the Arabs and Sunnites, by being the people and the sect that are finally willing to end the Zionist entity.
 

So taking an action that will wipe out the religious & demographic centre of Persian Shiism is the way to propel it to leadership? Yeah, sure. Wipe out the Persian Shia clergy & the power of Iran and Persian Shiism becomes a perhperal sect. Any momentary boost provided by martyrdom will be lost once the dust settles (literally) and the actual power base of the religion is gone.

 
And some within the Iranian leadership would be willing as they themselves have pointed out, to lose several million people which they feel they could afford with the assurance that Israel would be gone.
 

Would they? I suspect they will fight Israel to the last Lebanese or Palestinian.

Any Israeli attack on Iran that is not a response to a clear & present threat from Iran will not only kill any chance of change in Iran for a generation, it will as good as guarantee that no matter who governs iran they will continue to seek nuclear weapons.

 
You are completely wrong. If the brave Iranian people don't save the day, there is going to be a crisis as predictable and grave as 1938, and you don't even suspect it.

I am amazed. Really.
 

Yes yes yes Castellano. It is always Munich somewhere. I am amazed that supposedly intelligent people still think this tired cliche still means something.

If you want to see the true worth of trying to apply this sort of kindergarten level understanding of history to policy, take it from someone who was actually there - Anthony Eden. He was as obsessed with Munich as modern conservatives, and when his moment to stand firm came he took it - resulting in the stupidity of the Suez crisis.

Given that the protests in Iran seem to be on the wane we will find out shortly who is correct. Stay around for 18 months Castellano, if we don't have a World War (or at least a continent wide conventional one involving Iran) then perhaps we can finally bury these absurd histrionics.
 
 
 
My English is far from perfect. Did I understand you correctly and you just stated that Israel has attacked anybody in the last 30 years or in its entire History for that matter?

Because if that is the case it is completely false. A lie that you should retract immediately, lest your knowledge of History be totally discredited.

And yes, is true the regime uses proxies to attack its neighbors. Like in Lebanon 2006. I suppose that saves their face, since it is a method of waging War but is not "directly attacking or invading its neighbours", no?

 

There is no point debating notions as absurd as this, and I don't want to pull this thread off course yet again.

You appear to have a reflex that requires over the top outrage any time certain people say something you deem critical of Israel (I note your outrage seems to be inconsistently directed on this forum). The issue of Israel pops up in all sorts of threads that aren't specifically about Israel, so if you are going to be consistent you will be dragging a lot of threads of course.

Rather than put us all through the tedium this will cause, I have an idea. Set up a thread. Call it something snappy like 'Castellano's Isreal Re-education Thread' or some such. Every time an evil heretic or deviationaist like myself sullies the whiter than white image of Israel you can hold us up to the public ridicule & shame we no doubt deserve. Then, you can just post a link to the thread. That way, those who really want to find out just how horrible people like me are can do so. The rest of us can get on with the discussion at hand undisturbed.

How does that sound? You get to vent your outrage & we don't have to constantly pick our way around it. Everyone wins.

 Iran's Khamenei may be a casualty in vote crisis 

 
1 hr ago CAIRO (AP) — Just a few weeks ago, they would have been virtually unthinkable acts of defiance in Iran: standing up to the supreme leader, ignoring his warnings to stay off the streets — then chanting for his death.

But the boisterous opposition protests thrusting Iran into its worst civil unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have broken the taboo against direct criticism of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Now some are talking about him as a casualty of the crisis — and wondering if the aloof cleric's powerful office will survive after his eventual death.

For two decades, Khamenei's word has been law in Iran, where the supreme leader is considered by some as God's representative on Earth. Today he is reviled, not revered, by thousands of supporters of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, who claims he was defrauded in the June 12 presidential elections.

Unprecedented chants of "Death to Khamenei!" by some protesters underscore an astonishing blow to the 70-year-old cleric's standing.....

Khamenei, to be sure, has spent years meticulously cultivating support in the powerful military and judiciary, and that could mean he remains secure in the country's top job.

Khamenei quickly endorsed the results of the disputed election, which gave a landslide victory to his ally, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Militiamen loyal to Khamenei used lethal violence to crush street protests, one day after he warned in a nationally televised Friday sermon of bloodshed if opposition demonstrations continued.

His handling of the crisis and his support for the hard-line Ahmadinejad emboldened protesters to ignore his warning. And at the high echelons of the ruling elite, his actions have tempted two former presidents — reformist Mohammad Khatami and powerful insider Hashemi Rafsanjani — to come out in sympathy with the protesters, dealing another blow to Khamenei's standing.

Questioning the judgment and actions of a leader is not at all unusual in democracies, but it is a very serious step in Iran, where the supreme leader traditionally is a revered patriarchal figure whose word should be gospel to his nation.

But Khamenei has lost face. That has weakened him and is likely to prompt questions about his leadership for years to come.

Removing him from office may be difficult — though by no means impossible — but he may never live down what is widely seen among Iranians as the divisive role he played in a crisis in which a father-of-the-nation role was expected from him.

Additionally, there are no obvious successors at present to Khamenei.....
 
 
 
 
That said, I think it is unlikely that Iran would attack Israel with nuclear weapons.

 

That's a keeper Castellano, for future Iran-Israel related threads.  
 
 
 
Pure of what? Those who want their voice to be heard and not follow a hitler wannabe loon and a bunch of power hungry charlatans who defame the word of God for their own end? They're not going to keep anything pure, they're going to end up starting a war you have no chance of winning and getting a lot of your countrymen killed.

 

Amen to that one Ben. Hopefully it wont come to that.  
 
 
 
I agree with your point that this regime should certainly not be allowed to wield nuclear weapons, but I disagree that they would actually be stupid enough to use them. Using nuclear weapons will be like pressing the self-destruct button, and despite the fiery speeches, I really doubt Irani regime is that stupid.

Its a continuous chain, and everytime a new country goes nuclear, another one can make a case to go nuclear aswell.

 

*Agreed Tronic, but for the very few times we brought this world to that edge it was never based upon religion or anything to do with inillation of another country because of their ethnic backgrounds. It was done to protect the people from nuclear arms pointed at them from very few miles from shore.

IMO, Irans regime would never even consider complete intelligent talks before reaching for that extreme and drumming up support by citing a very bent version of religion to whip the people into frenzy. I know it sounds extreme but these individuals can NEVER get their hands on a weapon of such power or the civilized world as we know it will deteriorate very rapidly and before our eyes.
 
 
 
Good analysis by the Assoc Press writer.

 Iran's Khamenei may be a casualty in vote crisis 

 

If they consider this man "gods representative on earth" then I sure would hate to see what hell is really like given his track record. IMO God would never have chosen such a representative.Not even close.  
 
 
 
Tell me though, why is it that you have a problem with Iran having nuclear weapons, but not Pakistan ? Or China ?

*Because Pakistans nukes are somewhat controlled by the Chinese and neither of the two pose a radical religious type threat that Iran does.

 

Dreadnought is correct and I could not have phrased it better.
 
 
(CNN) -- Four Iranian footballers have been "retired" from the national side after protesting against the contested election result in the country during a match against South Korea, according to media reports.

Members of Iran's national soccer team sported green armbands in their game against South Korea.

The players drew attention to the situation in Iran by wearing green armbands during last week's World Cup qualifying match in Seoul.

Green was the color used by opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi during his campaign for the presidency and has been widely worn by supporters protesting since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was announced the winner.

Six players wore the armbands during the first half of the match, returning in the second minus the accessories.

However, according to Iranian news reports four players -- Ali Karimi, 31, Mehdi Mahdavikia, 32, Hosein Ka'abi, 24 and Vahid Hashemian, 32 -- have been "retired" from the sport following the gesture.

The pro-government newspaper, Iran, reported the players had received the equivalent of a life ban.

Ahmadinejad is a known football fan, and has taken a keen interest in the national team's affairs.

Last week he compared protesters in Tehran to fans of a losing soccer team.

In 2006 Iran was banned from international competition for a short time by the world governing body FIFA after claims of improper interference by his government

*Dam shame he cannot take such a "keen interest" in fair elections or whats for the better good of the Iranian people besides stoking a war that he will never win.

*Pretty bad when you have to ban sports players that disagree with the way you run a country and support legal opposition.

Poor excuse for a leader not to mention an even poorer excuse of a man. Evil little bastard he is, the world is going to be a much better place when he exits.

This ****ing retard would propbably lock up his own mother if she disagreed with him. It's a wonder he still breathes after this week.
 
 
 
It would likewise be foolish to act on the assumption that it is inevitable, which is what the 'threat to world peace' assumption is all about.

 

The threat to world peace has been explained over and over again.

You see, it is surprising that someone as obviously informed as yourself deliberately "forgets" the implications of a Islamic Republic with nukes:

- vicious terrorist thugs emboldened under a nuclear umbrella

- a nuke race in the Middle East

Now, if someone is going to tell me that nuclear proliferation in the Middle East is probably going to be OK, then, I start to get impatient; even outraged about the frivolity of such proposition.

And yes, that scenario will probably end in a nuclear exchange. Sooner or later. And even if doesn't, a lot of people, people like you and me Bigfella, will die because of the terrorist surge.
 
 
 
That's a keeper Castellano, for future Iran-Israel related threads.  

 

Keep it, keep it.

But please do mention the other part of my statement, which states that it cannot be discarded: "I'm absolutely sure that it would be foolish to discard the possibility"

Anyway, we are approaching the time to settle scores, and I'm actually looking for it. I'm thinking of most of the left, who laughably suggested that there will be any kind of "election" in Iran, when any such event was forestalled to begin with.

Bring it on.
 
 
 
There is no point debating notions as absurd as this, and I don't want to pull this thread off course yet again.

You appear to have a reflex that requires over the top outrage any time certain people say something you deem critical of Israel (I note your outrage seems to be inconsistently directed on this forum). The issue of Israel pops up in all sorts of threads that aren't specifically about Israel, so if you are going to be consistent you will be dragging a lot of threads of course.

Rather than put us all through the tedium this will cause, I have an idea. Set up a thread. Call it something snappy like 'Castellano's Isreal Re-education Thread' or some such. Every time an evil heretic or deviationaist like myself sullies the whiter than white image of Israel you can hold us up to the public ridicule & shame we no doubt deserve. Then, you can just post a link to the thread. That way, those who really want to find out just how horrible people like me are can do so. The rest of us can get on with the discussion at hand undisturbed.

How does that sound? You get to vent your outrage & we don't have to constantly pick our way around it. Everyone wins.

 

I'm going to watch football now.

For the time being I'll just say that is not a bad idea, but I'm thinking the best title would be:

"Israel and the moral and intellectual bankruptcy in the West (including Haaretz)"
 
 
 
*Agreed Tronic, but for the very few times we brought this world to that edge it was never based upon religion or anything to do with inillation of another country because of their ethnic backgrounds. It was done to protect the people from nuclear arms pointed at them from very few miles from shore.

IMO, Irans regime would never even consider complete intelligent talks before reaching for that extreme and drumming up support by citing a very bent version of religion to whip the people into frenzy. I know it sounds extreme but these individuals can NEVER get their hands on a weapon of such power or the civilized world as we know it will deteriorate very rapidly and before our eyes.

 

Yes, a regime change is a must for Iran to go nuclear. The government at the helm must be a people sanctioned government.

Both of those points already have been in play the day Pakistan went nuclear.

That has also been started, by Israel.
 
 
TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran said the gunman who killed Neda Agha-Soltan may have mistaken her for the sister of an Iranian "terrorist," the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.

In death, Neda Agha-Soltan has emerged as a powerful symbol of opposition to the Iranian government.

Iran blamed the death of the woman known to the world simply as Neda squarely on "those groups who want to create division in the nation," saying they planned the woman's killing "to accuse the Islamic republic of ruthlessly dealing with the opposition," according to IRNA, Iran's state-run news agency.

The report said the investigation into her death is ongoing, "but according to the evidence so far, it could be said that she was killed by mistake. The marksmen had mistaken her for the sister of one of the Monafeghin who had been executed in the province of Mazandaran some time ago."

Monafeghin refers to the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran, or PMOI, which promotes a secular, Marxist government for Iran, and has waged a violent campaign against the fundamentalist Islamic regime, including bombings that killed politicians, judges and Cabinet members.

Also known as Mujahedin-e-Khalq, the group initially was formed to oppose the Shah of Iran but fell out of favor with the Islamic Revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after 1979.

The European Union removed the group from its list of terrorist organizations this year, prompting outrage from Tehran. The Iranian Foreign Ministry accused the European Union of "making friends and cooperating with terrorists" by removing the group from its list.

Neda, 26, rose to prominence within hours after a crudely shot video documenting her final moments was uploaded to the Web. Shortly after she died Saturday from a single gunshot wound to the chest, she emerged as a powerful symbol of opposition to the Iranian government. See images of Neda and the impact of her death »

"It's heartbreaking," President Obama said Tuesday, referring to the video of Neda, which means "divine calling" in Farsi.

"And I think anyone who sees it knows there's something fundamentally unjust about it."

The Iranian government has sought to minimize the impact of her death.

RNA reported Wednesday that the killer, or killers, may have "thought that they were targeting one of the government opposition people and that is why they immediately distributed the video of the aftermath of the killing through the official and unofficial media in order to reach their murderous objectives against the Iranian government and revolution."

Yeah,   If the good people of Iran can believe this trobe of lies then they deserve this idiot as their leader. Its a bit late to explain away the girls death while the outside world watched you treat your own people like animals in the street.

I guess they also targeted the other sixteen people that were murdered in the streets by your own Basij and police forces because they were defrauded. Liar, Liar, Nuclear Plant and your world on fire !:P
 
 
Personally, Getting caught on video beating protesters could not have happened to a better bunch of dickheads. Glad the world got a glimpse into how you treat and respect the people you are "supposed" to serve as President. Dickhead!:P
 
 
 
I'm going to watch football now.

For the time being I'll just say that is not a bad idea, but I'm thinking the best title would be:

Call it whatever the hell you like, just do it.
 
 
 
Call it whatever the hell you like, just do it.

 

I'll probably do it.

But it won't spare you from my critique when I see you play your frivolous moral equivalence games.

There are at least 17 deaths. Imagine the emotive power of the images if only the death of some of the others were also caught on camera.
 
 
 
I'll probably do it.

But it won't spare you from my critique when I see you play your frivolous moral equivalence games.

 

I'm not asking to be spared. I'm not even asking for you to be consistent by holding others to the same standard (you certainly haven't so far). All I'm asking is that rather than put us all through yet one more version of the AIPAC-aproved history of Israel you put it in another thread & simply link to it. That way you can write page after page of critique without sending thread after thread off course.
 
 
The Globe & Mail thinks the opposition looks like petering out.

 Iran's opposition looks like it's petering out 

 
25 June [GlobeMail] It's beginning to look like the end of the line for the Mousavi opposition in Iran.

From the million-plus demonstrators that choked Tehran's streets a week ago, Tuesday saw only a handful of protesters brave enough to incur the wrath of police and paramilitary forces.

This followed two days in which protest numbers dropped off considerably.

What seems to have turned the tide was the strict warning issued Friday by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, followed Saturday by the violent response meted out to the 3,000 or so people who turned up to test the regime  at least 10 were killed, hundreds injured and scores arrested.

Now, it is the notorious Revolutionary Guard that says it will deal with any further protests, ratcheting up the threats and claiming the revolutionary high ground.

Tuesday was to have been a day of protest. Mir-Hossein Mousavi the challenger to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had defiantly called for mass rallies, but none transpired.

The Supreme Leader did give the Guardian Council five more days to investigate complaints of manipulating the vote in the June 12 presidential election that saw Mr. Ahmadinejad awarded 63 per cent of the vote, while Mr. Mousavi was said to have received 34 per cent.

But not even this extension  intended to pacify critics of the process  nor U.S. President Barack Obama's comments Tuesday that the world was bearing witness to how Iran was dealing with the peaceful pursuit of justice, is likely to turn back the tide....
 
 
 
Turn back the tide of what, a dictatorship backed by a theocracy that cheats its people of their rights and free elections? Yeah, a country I would want to live in.....NOT!  

The world will now laugh at any comments the Assahola or A-jad make. They certainly wont respect this poor excuse for a governemnt.

The reckoning will come Dread, but I don't think it will be today.

There are only two ways a government survives this sort of thing in the long term - the Burma option of the Beijing option.

The first will only work via a radical transformation of Iran that I don't think this lot can carry out (even if they want to - which I doubt). The second will only work through extremely deft & perceptive change & reform - which I suspect is a lot harder for a theocracy than it was for the CCP.

This lot are so stupid they have put life bans on members of the national football team. Angering people who already don't like you is never as dangerous as angering people who do. Banning footballers will do just that.

It may take years for this to play out, but I think we have seen the beginning of the end of the Islamic Republic in its current form. The smartest thing we can do is not interfere. Iranians can & must do things themselves. We can lend our voices and perhaps a few more practical things here or there, but we can never let anything outside Iran itself become the story.

*Agreed BigFella, But we also all know that every failure this poor excuse of a government has they will point the finger at the West. "IT MUST BE THE WEST'S FAULT" to remove blame from their pathetic selves for failed policies, isolation for the international community, and denial of the peoples rights.

I hope Obama is smart enough to call him out on such subjects each and every time he attempts it and especially I hope many world leaders calls this man out at the U.N. to explain the voter fraud and the denial of the Iranian peoples rights to free and transparent elections. It may fall upon deaf ears with their ignorance but it should still have light cast upon it at the U.N. level so the world may hear. They should not let this go until it causes his slide and the Assahola's slide from power.
 
 
A number of interesting points in this BBC report.

 Iran's Mousavi defies crackdown 

 
25 June [BBC] Iran protest leader Mir Hossein Mousavi says he holds those behind alleged "rigged" elections responsible for bloodshed during recent protests.

In a defiant statement on his website, he called for future protests to be in a way which would not "create tension." He complained of "complete" restrictions on his access to people and a crackdown on his media group.

A BBC correspondent in Tehran says the statement is a direct challenge to Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

In another development on Thursday, Iranian state media said that eight members of the pro-government Basij militia had been killed and dozens more wounded in the protests.

The eight deaths were in addition to 17 other people whose deaths have already been reported. The figures cannot be verified due to severe reporting restrictions inside Iran.

Separately, nearly two thirds of MPs appear to have stayed away from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election victory party.

All 290 MPs were invited to attend the party, Iran's press reports, but only 105 turned up.....

One of those who reportedly failed to turn up was Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, a high-profile figure who shares some of Mr Ahmadinejad's hardline views but has been critical of some aspects of the government's handling of the protests.

About 50 MPs are reformist and would not have been expected to attend the victory party....
 
 
 
(CNN) -- An event to remember the victims of Iran's post-election protests has been postponed Thursday, a day after security forces crushed a planned demonstration.

Riot police patrol a Tehran street earlier this week. Security forces are ever-present, one Iranian says.

The postponement was announced on the Web site of presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi's party Wednesday evening.

"Thursday's ceremony was meant to commemorate the 'the martyrs of the republic and freedom,' " the statement on the party site said.

The event was postponed for a week, but the site did not offer an alternate date.

Also Thursday, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the declared winner in the disputed June 12 election, told President Obama to stop "interfering" in Iran's affairs, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.

" The question is, do you want to use this kind of literature to address Iran and create a dialogue?" Ahmadinejad said. "If this is your position, then there is nothing to talk about."

Obama is walking a diplomatic tightrope in finding the right response to the crisis. Since taking office, the U.S. leader has sought rapprochement with Iran, but this week he said he was "appalled and outraged" by the post-election violence.

In Depth: Iran election fallout

The White House said Wednesday that it was rescinding invitations to Iranian diplomats overseas for Independence Day celebrations.

Seventeen people have died in clashes with government forces since the protests began more than a week ago, according to official figures.

CNN has received unconfirmed reports of as many as 150 deaths related to a popular uprising on Saturday alone.

The mood in Tehran on Thursday was "defiant but nervous," said one resident, whom CNN is not identifying for safety reasons.

Life was returning to routine, "but not like before the election," the resident wrote. Security forces were ever-present, he said. And after days of protest, the city was calmer.

The number of demonstrators venturing into Tehran's streets had fallen since Sunday, said CNN's Reza Sayah, who returned Wednesday to the U.S. from Iran.

Sayah said exhaustion from consecutive days of protest may have combined with fear of government reprisals.

CNN has received numerous accounts of nighttime roundups of opposition activists and international journalists by government forces.

After opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi met with university teachers Wednesday, police arrested 70 attendees and took them to an undisclosed location, his Web site said. CNN hasn't been able to verify the site's authenticity.

The key to what happens next depends on what role Moussavi plays, Sayah said. Moussavi's supporters say he was robbed of a victory and are demanding a fresh election. The official results gave Ahmadinejad a landslide win.

Meanwhile, Iran's ambassador to Mexico defended his country's actions in an interview Wednesday with CNN en Español. Ambassador Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri said there are acceptable ways of addressing electoral fraud, if any had occurred.

" But they go out on the street, they attack buses, they attack banks; that affects the security of the country," Ghadiri said.

"The minority can't impose their opinion on the majority. They can't impose a dictatorship, saying that the majority is not going to govern."

In the face of protests, authorities offered a partial recount. The Iranian Interior Ministry said Wednesday that it conducted a recount of some ballot boxes in the presence of another defeated candidate's representatives -- and found no discrepancies. Watch more on the protests »

Iran's government has restricted media access in the country, making it difficult to ascertain exact figures.

On Wednesday afternoon, security forces used overwhelming force to crack down on protesters who had flocked to Baharestan Square near the parliament building in Tehran, according to more than a half-dozen witnesses.

Police charged at the gathering -- clubbing demonstrators with batons, beating women and old men, and firing weapons into the air to disperse them, witnesses said. Watch what Iranian television is reporting »

"They were waiting for us," one witness said. "They all have guns and riot uniforms. It was like a mouse trap."

The melee extended beyond the square, one woman said.

"They emptied buses that were taking people there and let the private cars go on... and then, all of a sudden, some 500 people with clubs of wood, they came out of the Hedayat Mosque, and they poured into the streets and they started beating everyone," she said.

Government-run Press TV gave a starkly different account, saying about 200 protesters had gathered in front of the parliament and 50 others in a nearby square. All were dispersed by a heavy police presence, it said.

Someone who answered the phone at the nearby Bank of Melli hospital said no one had been admitted as a result of any clashes.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has endorsed the election results, reiterated Wednesday that the government "will never give in to coercive demands with regards to Iran's presidential elections," Press TV said.

Also Wednesday, Iranian authorities said they had arrested foreign nationals, some with British passports, in connection with the country's post-election unrest. Watch more on the diplomatic standoff »

The British Foreign Office said it was looking into the claims. It said it knew that one of the arrested nationals was Washington Times reporter Jason Fowden, who also goes by the name Iason Athanasiadis.

The Iranian government has long blamed other countries, especially Britain, for meddling in its affairs but has offered no proof.

Iran also said that Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, whose videotaped death has made her a face of the protests, might have been shot by mistake.

The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency said snipers may have mistaken her for the sister of a Monafeghin.

Monafeghin refers to the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran, which promotes a Marxist government and has waged a campaign against the fundamentalist Islamic regime.

*Yep, God forbid anybody voice opinion against you and Assahola not giving your people free uncorrupted elections and beating them in the streets when they get angry over being cheated. Piece of shit! We don't need dialogue with you but in Obamas defense its time the rules of the game changed as far as Iran's interference in Iraq and other places. !:P

What makes me laugh is that they make claims of the West interfering and offer zero proof but we have proof out the wazoo of Iran interfering in Iraq.
 
 
 
There are only two ways a government survives this sort of thing in the long term - the Burma option of the Beijing option.

 

Another is the Zimbabwe option, power sharing. I can shoot that one out of the water as easily as you can. So, save your ammo.

The China option is more plausible. But it won't be easy in a country where religious passions run high. It seems to me, however, that the government's best course is to make changes that will, at least, partially satisfy the dissidents. Throw an angry dog a bone and he'll settle down to chew.

This will be tricky because they don't want to appear to be caving in to the dissentents. Here one possible scenario:

First, replace supreme ruler, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (ostensibly on account of ill health). Of course, people will speculate that he got the axe because his hair-trigger announcement of A-Jad's victory before the Guardian Council, which is alone empowered to certify the winner, was illegal. It was the prime cause of the sudden, impromptu demonstrations. Stupid mistake.

The new man can uphold A-jad's victory simply by saying it was certified by the Guardian Council and that in the future the law will be followed. That would partially satisfy the dissidents.

The next step would be to call on everyone in the nation to honor the Islamic principle of forgiveness. Pragmatically, carrying out harsh punishments on the average people who protested would be a mistake. It would only stoke their anger and drive it below the surface where it could erupt again. The government has to engage the middle class, not alienate it.

Forgiveness has to be handled delicately; forgiving people who don't think they did anything wrong makes them angrier. It has to be universal for all acts on all sides following the election, which can be done if no specifics are mentioned.

The new supreme ruler could also call for election reforms that leave no doubt as to who the winner is next time. They could debate these ad infinitum, but that is better than maintaining that no change is needed.

They don't have years to heal the rift that's growing wider in their society. The fact is, the middle class is growing and is essential to the nation. They have to move quickly to regain the moral highground.
 
 
It's apparently not just some crazy protesters though that have issues with this election. The majority of the members of Iranian parliment refused to go to a dinner honoring Amj. You have former Presidents arguing about this, and high level officials.

I find it hard to believe that Mousavi who purposely stayed out of politics for 20 years, and reportedly turned down offers to run for President on several occasions before would jeopardize his standing in Iran just because. There's clearly something fishy going on, and the protesters have absolutely every right to scream at their top of their lungs in this case.

I actually think having a new election, with proper safe guards (maybe UN monitored) is the best way out of this, even more so than getting rid of the Supreme Leader. I heard there's talk that one will happen, and needs to happen. Amj, Mousavi and all the people can run and we can find out who the people want to be their President.

Rumors are that a run off may happen.
