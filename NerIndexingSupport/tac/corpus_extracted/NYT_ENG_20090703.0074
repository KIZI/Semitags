UCLA finished a close second for the services of Joseph Fauria
out of high school, but the Bruins landed him less than 18 months
later.

Fauria said Friday he is transferring to UCLA from Notre Dame,
where he was not going to play this season after being suspended by
the school's Office of Residence Life for a non-athletic issue.

"I'm going to end up at UCLA," he said. "I'm verbally
committed."

The 6-foot-7, 250-pound Fauria played in three games last
season. He will have three years of eligibility remaining once he
sits out the NCAA-mandated one year for transferring between
Football Bowl Subdivision schools.

It also is a reunion for Bruins starting quarterback Kevin
Prince and Fauria. They starred at Crespi High of Encino.

Fauria, the nephew of former NFL tight end Christian Fauria,
said he recently visited UCLA's campus and spoke to coach Rick
Neuheisel. He will join the Bruins for training camp in August.

"It's a great atmosphere," Fauria said. "It was my second
choice coming out of high school, got a good coaching staff and the
arrow is pointing up for the direction of the program."

Fauria's exit from Notre Dame was controversial, and cryptic,
after he was suspended by the school's administration. The school
did not disclose why he was suspended, and Fauria would not comment
on it.

He originally was going to remain home for the summer and the
2009 season, then return to South Bend, Ind., in January and rejoin
the football team. But soon after he decided to transfer from Notre
Dame.

Fighting Irish coach Charlie Weis agreed to Fauria's transfer
last week.

"My experience was positive, except toward the end," Fauria
said. "The program was great to me. My teammates were great to me.
I'm going to miss all of them.

"My beef is not with the football program or Coach Weis. It's
with the administration."
