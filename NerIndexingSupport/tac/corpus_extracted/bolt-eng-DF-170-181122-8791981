First Lady to Launch ‘Very Ambitious’ Campaign to End Childhood Obesity in One Generation

By LEE FERRAN

Feb. 9, 2010—Michelle Obama is formally announcing today what she called a "very ambitious" program to end the American plague of childhood obesity in a single generation.

"We want to eliminate this problem of childhood obesity in a generation. We want to get that done," the first lady told "Good Morning America’s" Robin Roberts in an exclusive morning television interview. "We want our kids to face a different and more optimistic future in terms of their lifespan."

So she wants to create an army of anorexic and bullemic teens who are pissed at their parents?

Anyway, good luck to her. But i dont think she should get a penny of taxpayer money.
 
 
From the Seiu website.

A well-conceived, robustly-funded reauthorization bill would:

Reduce hunger and food insecurity in America. A recent USDA Report showed that one in every four children live in households struggling against hunger;
Help reduce childhood overweight and obesity;
Improve child nutrition and health, and enhance child development and school readiness;
Provide fair wages and health care for food service workers. Food service workers are often paid poverty wages with few benefits and no paid sick days.

The Obama's are milking the Taxpayers for their buddies in the UNIONS. now that is some hope and change you can believe in.  
 
 
school lunches are made up of surplus ag products..simple as that....
 
 
i have been very disappointed by mrs. obama's programs. she has yet to make a real impact on anything...both of them have wasted a year in my opinion
 
 
 
So she wants to create an army of anorexic and bullemic teens who are pissed at their parents?

I think she should shave a few pounds off of that ghetto-bootie of hers first before she starts wagging her finger at our kids.

I hope she's successful. Kid's are too fat and lazy these days. Back in my day we did this thing called "playing outside." I understand that seems like a foreign concept to the youth of America today who are glued to their PS3s, PSPs, iPODs, iPhones, etc. as well as their parents who seem to be terrified at the very thought of their children being outside unsupervised because *ZOMG* something bad might happen to them.

Hello food police!

Maybe they might consider those communal food markets we discussed on another thread. Only offer healthy foods to those on food stamps. (Snarc mark here)
 
 
I'd really like to see the economics of parents of children in the obese catergory.
Government should hammer hammer hammer them on their lifestyles.
Might be a motivation to get off the Gov't cheese.

REAL women have hips and buns and thighs, and carry a certain percentage of body fat because it is optimum for carrying children, in other words, they have healthy babies. That is the way NATURE intended it. The opposite example in a First Lady would be Jackie Kennedy, who it seems could neither hold a baby in her body very well - she was subject to miscarry- losing several, nor seemed to hold much real interest for her husband.

Then there is the "other factor" - that the skinniest, the boniest, the non-breeding type, viewed from the rear, is indistinguishable from the early adolescent and late pre-pubescent male.

But hey, no accounting for taste, right ? ? ?
 
 
Today I bought a green pepper for $1.12 and a leek for $1.99. (that's right...I didn't take a leek...I payed for it)

For that money, I could have bought THREE 99-cent cheeseburgers at McDonalds, and had 14-cents left over.

THAT'S where the problem is. Healthy foods are too expensive.

Yes. I've heard it said that it's only in America where the poor people are fat.

Don't know where you live, but here in Cali, you are shopping in the wrong store.

Recent trip to ".99.99 cent store," TWO eggplants large,.99, three peppers, good sized, red, green, or yellow,.99 for the three, bag of cilatro, the same, a bag with eight persian cukes, the same, two huge (hamburger sliced size) onions, two heads of iceberg lettuce, or two of the long green leafy kind, 5 lbs of gold potatoes, or 10 lbs of regular potatoes,.99 a bag, various fruits, and other veggies... in the frozen section there were 1 lb bags of peas and carrots, and 1 lb. bags with broccoli, caulis and carrots, and in the fridge section there were two types of greens for salad, those good sized clear plastic boxes, one mixed, one baby spinach, and per each, again,.99. so if there is one of those stores around, and they have fresh stuff, you might check that out. All 99 and dollar stores now accept the ebt cards, according to the auto machines that do atm and credit cards!

For those that like it, they have had LARGE bottles of Kraft, Ranch, Catalina, and all the rest, as well as spray flavor for salads, brand names! One just has to shop around, and pay attention. Of course one has to also be the sort not too "proud" to shop at the.99. If a person is one of those who can only go to the high end store, well what can I say!

For those that do have EBT cards, they need to know how to shop. Once upon a time it was taught in school. In Nutrition/Health classes, do they even have those classes now? And, the school snack bars serve cheeseburgers and fries, and this is because parents lobbied, because students whined, so whose fault is it?????

I think the problem is that the vegetables that I purchased came from Cali, yet the store in which I purchased them is as far away from Cali as you can get while still being in the USA.

For those living in a climate where there is winter freeze, one can, properly managed, store root crops in a basement area if there is one, and properly stored, they do last! Root cellars had a purpose. Many vegetables lasted the winter, it was the way the old folks did it. This is the season of New England boiled dinners, and fish soups, and chowders, with onions, kraut has large amounts of scurvy inhibiting vitamin c, and so on. I am sure all that is on the net, and one can microwave root veggies to save energy... eating seasonally can still be very healthy, or the really enterprising can grow indoor veggies with a grow light... that broad spectrum light wards off S.A.D. (Seasonal Affective Disorder-those deep winter blues), just depends on being determined! and hell, yeah, takes a little work, but work vs. spending heavily, again a choice!

They want to feed hungry children and give food service workers a decent wage? THESE GODDAMN SOCIALIST BASTARDS!!!! IF THE POOR KIDS WERE MEANT TO EAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN BORN INTO RICH FAMILIES!!!!
 
 
 
I hope she's successful. Kid's are too fat and lazy these days. Back in my day we did this thing called "playing outside."

I hope she is successful in educating parents to turn off the TVs, take away the sedentary games for the Wii's for awhile, and encourage their kids to get out and run and play like kids used to do. I hope she is successful in encouraging parents to take away a lot of the french fries and potato chips and TV trays and start sitting down to a balanced dinner with their kids. All that would be a worthy project for a First Lady or any person with a national forum and personal influence.

But even when kids didn't have much television or Wii's or video games of any kind to keep them indoors, and when families were eating far fewer processed and hormone laden foods and empty calories, there were still overweight kids.

And THAT is not the government's business and it should stay out of it.

So far, I've only read one page, but I guess no one cares that our kids have become noncompetitive in sports (there goes the Olympic wins in future years), are so unhealthy they already are in the danger zone with high blood pressure, will require medical attention younger and longer than ever before (at whose cost?), and generally in poor physical condition. What will our soldiers look like in 20 years?

When one-half of our population is overweight, and a third morbidly obese, with children not far behind, this is just one more huge negative factor contributing to the United States ever being able to reassert itself as the most productive, forward thinking, forward moving, and healthiest country in the world.

The usual bullshit coming from the rabid cons just because it's Michelle Obama, that's why. If it had been Laura Bush promoting this, they would all be talking about how fat and lazy the libs are and that her cause is justified. But because it's Michelle Obama, even though of course everyone knows that kids are becoming overweight and unhealthy, her effort will get slammed. It's just politics as usual, Foxy, from the usual chorus of the shortsighted.

Why not only offer healty food to everyone?
 
 
Huh? Anyone can buy healthy food, but in poorer households people tend to eat more carbs and fast foods. Or so I've heard.

Its a problem and I hope Mrs. Obama can save a few chubbies, but I'm with the people here who blame lack of exercise. Some schools in NJ are letting kids "opt out" of phys ed, and if you saw how many kids in my HS that refuse to even dress, you might be shocked. They don't even have to participate to get a grade - just put on a pair of sneakers. Too lazy to even do that. Blows my mind.

Poorer households purchase more fattening foods because they're CHEAPER. Hell just yesterday, I paid $3.29 for a head of iceberg lettuce, half of which will go bad.
 
 
Yes I know. And that's why free lunches at schools tend to be less healthy. It's more expensive and there's the spoil factor.

I don't think it's lack of education though. Most people know they should eat more fruits and veggies, but they just don't do it.

I pushed my son into high school sports. He's not the greatest athlete, but it's great exercise and also good for the mind. He likes it and is getting better every year.

Cheaper cuts of meat, except for fat laden hamburger, are usually healthier than expensive cuts. Cheaper cuts of chicken are even cheaper than cheaper cuts of beef or pork. Iceberg lettuce is a 'token' veggie anyway. Dried beans, peas, lentils, rice, potatoes, and the dark green and yellow veggies are plentiful and generally affordable. (I work with low income families to help them plan menus and shop within their budgets. It isn't easy but you can feed a family of four a healthy diet for not a lot of money.)

But we are on the same page re exercise and probably education. It is not easy to motivate the parents to restrict the kids' television and video game time and spend more time reading or playing outdoors. Too often you're dealing with a single parent who just doesn't have the energy or stamina to put up with the hassle. Our church has built a gymnasium and community center mostly for that very reason and we are convincing parents to encourage their kids to go there after school and weekends. They are getting exposed to some very good habits and new interests as a result.

Or, if you're on a really tight budget, you don't buy green peppers and leeks. You buy a small sweet onion and maybe half a cabbage to stew with a potato or two - healthy soup or stew or lunch for several for under $2.00. (It can be enhanced with yesterday's leftover potroast or chicken and whatever veggies the kids didn't eat then.)

Yes, years ago we befriended a guy--Chinese citizenship from Hong Kong but living in France and going to photography school in West Virginia. He refused to eat in American restaurants because he didn't trust the food.  

He brought a can of corn or beans or some such for his lunches. His breakfast and dinner he prepared himself, generally some sort of soup and rice, but quite meager by American tastes. He was healthy as a horse, and strong with incredible energy and stamina. Just because many Americans can afford to eat fancy/lavishly doesn't necessarily mean they are eating healthy.

Yep, most Asian nations have MUCH lower per capita income than the USA, and not a lot of Fatties.

Eating more fruits and vegetables needs to start very, very early, while children are toddlers. Once they get a taste of how delicious fatty foods are, they will never be satisfied with plain and subtle flavors. Whover discovers a healthy alternative to fat that tastes just as good will literally rule the world.

I dearly love Big Macs and survived on them for lunch practically every day for years. The only reason I stopped eating them is when I realized what might be lurking in those mass-produced patties. But that doesn't mean I still don't get a craving.

This guy had plenty of money and could easily afford a much different diet than what he chose. But unless they are among the starving poor, you're right that most Asians tend to eat healthier diets than most Americans.
