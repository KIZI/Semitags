Singapore's domestic wholesale trade for the third quarter of 2009 declined by
23.3 percent compared with a year ago, government data showed on Friday.

This could be attributed to lower sales in the ship chandlers and bunkering,
petroleum and petroleum products, general wholesale trade and electronic
components sectors, for which the decline was mainly due to price effect,
according to the Singapore Department of Statistics (SDS).

After removing price effect, domestic wholesale trade volume showed a year-on-
year increase of 5 percent.

Domestic wholesale trade (seasonally adjusted) increased by 6.1 percent in the
third quarter compared with the previous quarter.
