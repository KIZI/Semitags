Officials from the U.S. and Mexico say authorities have arrested reputed Tijuana drug kingpin Teodoro "El Teo" Garcia Simental in a fishing city on the Baja California peninsula.

The officials say Garcia Simental was arrested early Tuesday in La Paz. He is the second alleged major drug lord to be taken down in less than a month by President Felipe Calderon's government.

A U.S. federal official and a Mexican law enforcement official confirmed the arrest. Neither official was authorized to give their name for publication.

Garcia is among Mexico's 24 most-wanted drug lords and the government had offered $2.1 million for information leading to his arrest.

Garcia's gang is blamed for much of the bloodshed in Tijuana.
