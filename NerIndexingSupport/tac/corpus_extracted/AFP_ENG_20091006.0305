Investigators have unearthed new suspects in the killing of Russian journalist
Anna Politkovskaya, her former newspaper said on Tuesday, three years after her
murder which remains unsolved.

"I can tell you that the investigation has turned up new people whose names
haven't been published," said Novaya Gazeta deputy editor Sergei Sokolov, the
former employer of Politkovskaya, who was shot at the entrance to her apartment
building on October 7, 2006.

He did not give further details on the individuals.

Sokolov said that the man believed by investigators to be Politkovskaya's
killer, Rustam Makhmudov, is on the run. "He is abroad and moving from one
country to another," Sokolov said.

He named Makhmudov's whereabouts as a country that is "a member of the European
Union," without elaborating.

A lack of international police coordination allowed Makhmudov to flee, Sokolov
said. "He could have been arrested from April onwards, but he has managed to
disappear again."

The Russian supreme court sent the case back to prosecutors for further
investigation in September.

The three suspects, including Rustam Makhmudov's brothers Ibragim and Dzhabrail,
were initially acquitted on lack of evidence before the supreme court quashed
the ruling.

Investigators have failed to identify the person who ordered the killing.

"The investigation has a new chance, I think it is the last one," Ilya
Politkovsky, the victim's son, told journalists.

Twenty-two Russian journalists have been killed since March 2000 in crimes
linked to their professional activities, said Tikhon Dziadko, a Russian
representative of Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF).

Two representatives of RSF, including Secretary-General Jean-Francois Julliard,
were unable to attend the press conference in Russia due to "visa problems,"
Dziadko said.
