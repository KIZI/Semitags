 
 
Ha! It's Back! RealJohnBoy's A2K NFL "Pick-Um" Game!
 
 
Yes, indeed. This will be our 7th season playing this - going all the way back to the Fall of 2004.
It is really simple to play. All you have to do is guess the winning teams in the NFL games each week. No registration is needed here or on Yahoo or ESPN. No vast knowledge (or even superficial knowledge) of professional football is needed.
Participation can take as little as 5 minutes a week. How easy is that?

Watch this space this weekend for details on playing and, perhaps, comments from folks who have played in the past.
 
 
the detroit lions will win the superbowl, defeating the baltimore ravens by a score of 5 - 2
 
 
@realjohnboy,

do i have to be in this from the start, cause i'm gonna be unplugged and up north for a week or so (back on line on the 9th)
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Seventh season, we're maturing....

Maybe I'm not. I fail to remember how well or horribly I've done from year to year.
 
 
@djjd62,

Not to answer for rjb, but to answer quickly, no, you don't. Though of course you can do your list pre-leaving for vacation. Some portion of our choices are slaphappy guessing anyway, even for the more astute.

edit -
Just caught that you are leaving tomorrow. I think season starts Sept 7 at gametime, which is before-which-you-need-to-post for that first week. But you can still play even if you miss that.
 
 
Here is the schedule for Week #1:
>Thursday, 9/9:
Minnesota @ New Orleans
>Sunday, 9/12, early games:
Cleveland @ Tampa Bay
Miami @ Buffalo
Cincinnati @ New England
Carolina @ NY Giants
Detroit @ Chicago
Atlanta @ Pittsburgh
Oakland @ Tennessee
Denver @ Jacksonville
Indianapolis @ Houston
>Sunday, 9/12, late games:
Arizona @ St Louis
Green Bay @ Philadelphia
San Francisco @ Seattle
>Sunday, 9/12, night:
Dallas @ Washington
>Monday night, 9/13, early:
Baltimore @ NY Jets
>Monday night, 9/13, late:
San Diego @ Kansas City (+ final score)

Deadline for ALL games is before the 1st game on 9/9. Please be sure to pick all of the games and include your guess as to the final score in the last game.
Thanks.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Oops, goofed: the 9th.
 
 
WEEK 1

Thu, Sep 09
MIN @ NO

Sun, Sep 12
CLE @ TB
MIA @ BUF
CIN @ NE
CAR @ NYG
DET @ CHI
ATL @ PIT
OAK @ TEN
DEN @ JAC
IND @ HOU
ARI @ STL
GB @ PHI
SF @ SEA
DAL @ WAS

Mon, Sep 13
BAL @ NYJ
SD @ KC
 
 
So that is the schedule you would see each week. You would post here with your picks:
N.O.
T.B
etc, down through
SD (27) - KC (14).

If you want to use a screen name beyond your A2K one, you can. I, for example, am the Rappin' Rednecks.
 
 
Rules and things:
We post the schedule on Tuesday for the following week and players are supposed to make ALL of their picks before the start of the 1st game. The Thursday night game left us with a very narrow window that was not real convenient for some. I tried going to putting up the schedule on Sunday afternoon, but that led to some confusion. I modified the rule such that players could just pick the Thursday game and then come back before kickoff on Sunday to pick up the rest.

I would like to try again with posting the schedule on Sunday (in this case, Week #2 would appear on the Sunday of Week #1).

Remember that you can change your picks at anytime up to the start of the 1st game of the "weekend." I do ask that you kind of shout that out so I can be sure to see it.
I have been running this for most of the previous 6 years. I did tend to change or bend rules for awhile, but I am much more strict lately as to getting picks in on time unless we hear a compelling story. A hurricane in Houston worked.
 
 
@djjd62,

djjd62: I have Matthew Stafford on my Fantasy Football team roster. He could be good if he can get his INT's down.
 
 
SCORING:
The winner each week is determined by dividing the number of correct picks by the number of games picked.
A cumulative score for the season uses the same equation. The nice thing there is that a player is not penalized for inadvertently leaving out a game or having to even miss out on a week if the need arises.
At some point in the season, though, I can drop a player from the cumulative standings if participation drops off.
 
 
HISTORY: Kickycan in NYC started this in the Fall of 2004. We had all of 6 players in an A2K where sports was of little interest. I took over mid-season and have been running it since. Except in year 4 when JPB in Chicago ran the whole thing for a year. She ran it well but has never talked to me since.

This sucker has grown and grown. In the 2008-2009 season we got to 22 regular players each week. I thought that would be about it, but last year we had 27 players.
I see that a number of players from last year don't appear to be on A2K anymore.
27 could be hard to match.
But I invite you all to play. You might be surprised at who ends up here. There are folks who have many other interests. There are people who don't necessarily get along well on other threads. Everyone is welcome.
Let me know by posting here if you think you might be interested in joining. I can tentatively assign you a column on my scorecard.
Ask any questions you want about how the game is played.
Thanks and good night.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

i am in.
i am so totally and completely in.
i am in... i am so very in...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'll take a column, rjb. Thanks for your efforts in cat herding. I know Cowdoc is traveling soon (or now...) but I think he/they are planning on playing.

@realjohnboy,

Count me in. looking forward to it.

My off-the-wall prediction...a repeat of last yrs opponent in SB
Colts and Saints
 
 
I'm in, as always.

I will make my picks after consulting with experts, analyzing each teams strengths and weaknesses, examing the scouting reports, and talking to other players.

After I do all that, I will simply consult my magic 8 ball and give you my best guess.
 
 
I will likely participate. I always wipe the floor with the competition. Hope no one holds grudges.
 
 
Excellent. 12 players have so far indicated - publicly here or via email - that they expect to play. A very good start.
I was digging through the archives.
Year #1 (2004-2005): 6 players and Johnboy (from VA) won.
Year #2 (2005-2006): 12 players with Kickycan (NYC) winning.
Year #3 (2006-2007): 18 players. Chiso (TX) triumphed.
Year #4 (2007-2008): 19 players and Cowdoc (ID) took honors.
Year #5 (2008-2009): 20 players with Ragman (now of FL) getting the glory.
Year #6 (2009-2010): 27 players and Spendius (Northern England) won it.

Tico has never won.
 
 
I'm in.

Have to check my closet for dominant colours. Will match to team colours.

Or not.
 
 
I've made my first guesses, er, estimations, but I'm going to let them stew in the hot sun for a few days.
 
 
I got word earlier today from Spendius indicating that he might not have the time this season to play. I am normally a mild mannered individual, but I let him know that that was not going to acceptable. Not at all.
He, from his bar stool in Northern England, spent an inordinate amount of time last year trashing the game of American football and the men who play it and probably the cheerleaders and the fans.
And he won the season.
After an exchange of emails, Spendius has agreed to defend his crown this year.
He thinks he can beat back the "Revenge of the Yanks."
He moves into my scorecard in slot #13.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

#13, perfect!!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

But wait! There is more from our Useless Statistics desk! In {...} for each team is the number of points they scored/number of points scored against them and the +/- difference for 2009. If someone has the time to put some of the best and worst numbers in color it would, um, add a bit of color here

Here is the schedule for Week #1 - along with each team's record for 2009-2010.

SD @ KC.... SD 31-10

I did this in a more complicated way than I may keep doing, as I like to be able to look back and see who I picked, and where the game is..
Next time I'll skip the color.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Very nicely laid out, Osso. Very easy for me to read.

Remember, all, that you can post picks and then change them all the way up to the kickoff of the 1st game (in this case, Thursday 9/9). I buy white-out in a 55 gallon drum at the start of each season.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

The dots drove me nuts, I'll have to figure another way to leave a big space.

I'm remembering re the white-out..

I noticed you didn't say, "nice selections".
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Eat my dust, as the 'Necks will sprint out of the gate
 

Just like a herd of turtles...LOL
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
The dots drove me nuts, I'll have to figure another way to leave a big space.
 
you could use Code brackets to line things up better...
Code: Min @ NO.....NO
Cle @ TB.....TB
Mia @ Buf....BUF
Code: Min @ NO NO
Cle @ TB TB
Mia @ Buf BUF

but no other text formatting (bold, color, size) is allowed in Code...
 
 
@Region Philbis,

Thanks, I'll play with it. Goshdarnit, I hadn't noticed Code was in the reply page.

Another thing you might know, how do you do a line through a word to show you thought better of it? (Heh, as I might think of CIN)
 
 
@ossobuco,

Strikethrough
Code: [strike]Strikethrough[/strike]
 
 
@Region Philbis,

aha, thanks..
 
 
Anyone know whether or ESPN website has their NFL expert (free) weekly game picks going to be available anymore? I know that they've put on their website a pay service that is Insider info, but for years they had a 5- or 6-person panel that provided picks typically by Thursday night/Friday morning.

@JPB,

You're right, darlin! Just woke up in Beijing (4:30 in the morning - this jet lag is not conducive to full nights' sleep) and won't be home until the 12th, but I've been assured that our hotels in Harbin and Shanghai will have internet access as good as this one. I'll sure plan to be in, and ask the Miz as well. It wouldn't hurt if you and/or Johnboy sent her a message in case either or both of us forget about it. You know how this age thing affects us.......
 
 
@CowDoc,

What is the CowDoc doing in Beijing? Thanks, JPB, for tracking him down. We look forward to having him and the Miz back in again this year.
19 players have indicated an interest in playing and 6 of us have already posted picks for Week #1.
We will start leaning a bit harder on people this weekend and after Labor Day.

@realjohnboy,

I'm on a diplomatic/trade mission for the National Association of Counties over here, rjb. Shows you just how desperate local government has gotten during this recession. Lots of folks in Idaho said they were going to watch CNN for reports from China regarding international incidents while I'm gone.
 
 
@CowDoc,

I'm headed to Idaho this weekend, CD. Why is it the weekend I come to visit your fair state, you are over in China? Oh, well... we're not likely to get out of Boise anyway!
 
 
@CowDoc,

So we know who to blame if we go to war with China, right?
 
 
@mysteryman,

I'm a very responsible person. Every time things go to hell in a handbasket, seems like everybody says I'm responsible.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Sorry about that, Tico...be sure to let me know when you might come to Salmon. We'd love to have you let us show you around the country.
 
 
@CowDoc,

My mother used to have this sign on her desk at work...

Its not my job to drive the train
the whistle I cant blow
Its not my job to say how fast the trains allowed to go
Its not my job to shovel coal
or even ring the bell
But let the damn thing jump the track
and see who catches hell.
 
 
RJB....

I am changing one of my picks!!!

Please change my pick in the steelers-atlanta game to ATLANTA.
All of my other picks remain the same.

Thank you.
 
 
Probably a smart move with Ben suspended for 4 weeks and #2 QB Leftwich banged up.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Yea, they will either start Charlie Batch or a rookie.
Neither one is a good choice,IMHO.
 
 
Lmur wrote from Ireland to tell me he will play again this year. He wants to do his part to stop Spendius from the UK, which has dominated Ireland for 900 years.
That would put us at 20 players so far indicating an interest.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

If you would like to play, all you have to do is predict the winners in these games (+ the final score in the last game). How easy is that?
Post your picks right here on A2K for all of the games before the kickoff of the game on Thursday, September 9th.
It's a simple game for simple people.
I thought I would attract some of the new philosophers on A2K. None yet, though.

@lmur,

Don't expect to be around next week, so here are my picks for WEEK 2.

Packers
Bengals
Steelers
Cowboys
Eagles
Panthers
Cardinals
Browns
Vikings
Broncos
Raiders
Skins
Chargers
Patriots
Colts
49'ers 28-21

As an aside, while entering the above, I entered the capital letter on each line first and found myself entering "ow boys" for Dallas.
 
 
Lmur from Ireland BOLDLY picks.
 
 
@lmur,

Imur: I just happened to notice on your picks you made some errors. At the top of your picks you picked the Bengalas and on the bottom you also picked the Patriots.

Also on the bottom of the list, where you have to pick the final gamre scores, you picked the SF 49ers, but the game is between the SD Chargers and the Chiefs.
 
 
@Ragman,

lmur: Sorry...but I misread. Your picks were for week #2, not week #1.
 
 
<I'm changing my mind on some games, but will wait to post for a day or two>
 
 
@ossobuco,

... bet one of them is the pesky Steeler's game, huh?
 
 
@Ragman,

Osso (snicker, snicker) has Cincy over NE and Houston over Indy. What does she know?
She's a girl.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm considering killing off Cincy; well, and a few other teams, but not yet.
 
 
@ossobuco,

The smart guys (sports experts) have Cincy-NE closely matched at 54% in favor of NE to -Bungles 46%. However, my feeling FWIW is that the home opener for Pats is certainly a must-win in terms of being the table-setter. Despite his unpopularity, 'the Hoodie' is one of the best there is at getting his team ready for game #1. The question is how porous is Pats D in relationship to Bungle's D?
 
 
I think that NE is indeed overrated.
 
 
@Ragman,

I read some decimating stuff, as in NE has vulnerabilities too.
I remember from other years that there are big surprises in the first games (well, hey, the rest too, but especially the first) - - the trick being to figure out what the surprises will be.
 
 
@ossobuco,

So, you're saying the first game has been less predictable statisticallyaccording to recent history?
 
 
@Ragman,

Yes, I'm saying that, it's what I remember, but, y'know,

never trust me.

It's probably look up-able.. re how espn/si folk (etc) did..

@mysteryman,

 
Yea, they will either start Charlie Batch or a rookie.
Neither one is a good choice,IMHO.

 
2 nd year man Dennis Dixon gets the nod, apparently due to strong showing in exhibition...

@Region Philbis,

I heard that today on ESPN radio.
The reason given by ESPN is that if Dixon screws up real bad, they can go to Batch as an experienced QB to try and salvage something.

But if Batch were to start and screw up, a 2nd year QB doesnt have the experience to salvage the game.

I dont know that I agree with that train of thought, but it does make some sense.
 
 
Think I'll join ya this year. Looks like fun.

Welcome, Coastal Rat. We look forward to your wisdom here.
Osso's changes are duly noted.
I got an email from Rhys but he only picked in the first game. I'll have to track him down.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Glad to see Coastal Rat...
I'm a little confused on what team he thinks will win in the last game.
 
 
@ossobuco,

he picked SD, right?
 
 
@Ragman,

I did pick San Diego. Not sure why the confusion. I wasn't even clowning around or anything. Seriously. I wasn't. Really. lol
 
 
@CoastalRat,

I think it's the nose!  
 
 
@Ragman,

I wasn't confused.
 
 
@Ragman,

The nose and the eyebrows..  
 
 
@ossobuco,

Yeah, I'm a handsome devil, ain't I? I've been told it is my moderate use of makeup that does the trick.
 
 
@CoastalRat,

If you ask me, you went overboard on that clown paint. Just sayin'
 
 
@panzade,

If you read CoastalRat's profile, Panzade, you will note that he is...
(are you ready for this?)...
AN ACCOUNTANT!
 
 
Rhys emailed me his picks. He, George's son, is not on A2K. He knows football, methinks. He always includes a phrase or two about what influenced his choices, but I was asked last year to not quote him here.
Rhys - Week #1:
Minnesota
Cleveland
Buffalo
New England
Carolina
Chicago
Pittsburgh
Tennessee
Jacksonville
Indianapolis
Arizona
Philadelphia
Seattle ("Rice-a-roni vs Starbucks" - too good for me to ignore)
Dallas
Baltimore
San Diego (27-10)

I am going hunting tomorrow for a whole bunch of folks. You know who you are. I know where you live.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Right John. It's on My Posts now.

Looking forward to a fair competition.
 
 
@spendius,

You might have thought fit to mention the defending champion in your starter post John and the absolute necessity of deposing him. Two in a row would be unthinkable.
 
 
@spendius,

John probably figured that since you don't believe in evolution you wouldn't be able to evolve and acquire the skills to compete in a more difficult schedule.
 
 
@spendius,

 
You might have thought fit to mention the defending champion in your starter post John and the absolute necessity of deposing him. Two in a row would be unthinkable.

 

I put up several posts early on, Spendius, about this game. I spread those "starter" paragraphs out over 2 or perhaps 3 pages. My writers here insisted on my doing that. Yes, I am reading from a script that someone else has crafted. I am merely sitting behind a table at A2K NFL Pickum Central. And, like all people sitting behind anchor desks, I am not wearing pants.
But I digress.
Spendius won this game last year but he is naive if he thinks he can do it again. The Canuck, the Mexican, the Irishman and those of us who are true Americans will crush him this go round.
That is the way I see it.

And Panzade. You there in Florida. Are you just going to snipe from the sidelines? Or can you help us put Spendius in his place?
 
 
C'mon, Panz!

Damn. I had a pretty good day of nagging.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
If you would like to play, all you have to do is predict the winners in these games (+ the final score in the last game). How easy is that?
Post your picks right here on A2K for all of the games before the kickoff of the game on Thursday, September 9th.
It's a simple game for simple people.
I thought I would attract some of the new philosophers on A2K. None yet, though.

 
Here is the schedule for Week #1:
>Thursday, 9/9:
Minnesota @ New Orleans
>Sunday, 9/12, early games:
Cleveland @ Tampa Bay
Miami @ Buffalo
Cincinnati @ New England
Carolina @ NY Giants
Detroit @ Chicago
Atlanta @ Pittsburgh
Oakland @ Tennessee
Denver @ Jacksonville
Indianapolis @ Houston
>Sunday, 9/12, late games:
Arizona @ St Louis
Green Bay @ Philadelphia
San Francisco @ Seattle
>Sunday, 9/12, night:
Dallas @ Washington
>Monday night, 9/13, early:
Baltimore @ NY Jets
>Monday night, 9/13, late:
San Diego @ Kansas City (+ final score)

Deadline for ALL games is before the 1st game on 9/9. Please be sure to pick all of the games and include your guess as to the final score in the last game.
Thanks.

 

 
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I assume I'm on your hunting list. No need - I'll make my picks manana.
 
 
@JPB,

I was low crawling towards your house, pencil and scorecard clenched between my teeth. Okay. Um, do you know where Wandeljw lives?
Can you talk RH into playing?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
I am not wearing pants
 

Thats a mental image I really didnt need before going to bed.
Now I have to wash my eyes out with bleach.
 
 
Picture him in surfer pants.. oh, go on, picture it.

edit, I'm an rhb fan. He may be a great surfer. It is my role to snarl.
 
 
@ossobuco,

We're up late here on the West Coast osso
 
 
@panzade,

Like, so?
 
 
@panzade,

What is it you want me to agree to?

late here on the west coast, speaking of pandering.
 
 
I know, I'm a brat.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
Like, so?
 

Is that, like, Valley Girl-speak?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thursday, 9/9:
New Orleans - Wishful thinking. I think they could easily lose it from all the hype and celebrations before the game.

Sunday, 9/12, early games:
Tampa Bay
Miami
Cincinnati
NY Giants
Detroit - The Bears continue to suck.
Pittsburgh
Tennessee
Denver
Houston - upset of the week

Sunday, 9/12, late games:
Arizona
Green Bay
San Francisco

Sunday, 9/12, night:
Dallas

Monday night, 9/13, early:
NY Jets - only because it's in NY

Monday night, 9/13, late:
San Diego 21-10
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
#13, perfect!!
 

He may have waited osso in order to put the hex on me. I didn't know you were superstitious.

Might I suggest a convenience for those who need to be absent in any week. It is that they are allowed to use my picks as defending champion.

10th Sept- New Orleans Saints. The Celibates
12th Sept-New York Giants. The Big Dicks
Miami Dolphins. The Flashers
Atlanta Falcons. The Shifters
Chicago Bears. The Huggers.
New England Patriots. The Good Boys.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bad Boys.
Jacksonville Jaguars. The Biters.
Indianapolis Colts. The Randies.
Tennessee Titans. The Really Big Dicks.
Green Bay Packers. The Squeezers.
San Francisco 49ers. The Miners.
Arizona Cardinals. The Smugs.
13th Sept- Dallas Cowboys. The Brokebacks.
14th Sept- New York Jets. The Spurters.
San Diego Chargers. The Bisons. (18--14).

And may the best man win. If a woman wins I'm putting my Americana books in the cellar under a flag.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Like, it's cool to be in the same time zone as you querida.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

My parents lived in that valley when I was born, so I suppose I'm a valley girl...

one more day until the footballs fly and the tackles miss their appointments with the opposition...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I know you weren't. That's why I posted what I thought was a correction.
I just like your nose.
 
 
@spendius,

Being the stronger power here in USofA, we let you win because we like your beer and ales. We would hate to get shut off - speshully at game time.
 
 
Oops, not your nose...Coastal's. I was jsut calling Coastal's attention..and overstepping my pedestrian boundaries as a causal observer.

Andy/Clubber, the Belle Morte singer who works for me, is in with his picks. He joins us for his second season. I think he finished around 4th last year. As I recall, he went for broke in the final couple of weeks last year, picking - but not correctly picking - upsets.
He is a big Steelers fan.

San Diego (24-7)

We have picks from 20 players so far and I have a few other invitations still floating around out there, including EhBeth and Fbaezer. The former will probably join today or tomorrow. The latter could be away. I note he hasn't been actively involved this week in the Fantasy Baseball thread.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Fbaezer was  here  earlier this afternoon...
 
 
@Region Philbis,

Thanks, Region. I am going for Rockhead, Gargamel and Fbaezer in one fell swoop. That would be quite a coup.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

My suggestion earlier Johnnie came about from my thinking what would I prefer to happen if I unavoidably had to miss a week. Being allotted the same picks as the Defending Champion would be my preferred choice. Only once a season mind you for any one player. Otherwise the likes of wande and Tico would be making feeble excuses every other week in an attempt to get into the top half of the table. Or at least above osso.

But not a choice available to the Defending Champion. Defending Champions are handicapped in this respect to try to prevent anyone winning the Championship two years running as I am attempting to do. And I don't underestimate the challenge to my Crown. The paucity and grudging nature of the congratulations I received when I won the Championship last year at the first attempt told me all I need to know about the dent I made in American pride.

But when all's said and done it got me enjoying American football and that's worth as much as any Title. Apart from the commentators. They are dire. The camera work is a bit out of date as well when compared to a 5-day Test Match team. And the rumpy-pumpy scandals are hopeless compared to our's.
 
 
@spendius,

 
Might I suggest a convenience for those who need to be absent in any week. It is that they are allowed to use my picks as defending champion.
 

May I suggest that anyone considering such a maneuver be kicked off the thread?
 
 
@spendius,

 
The camera work is a bit out of date as well when compared to a 5-day Test Match team.

 

Many, many years ago when I was much, much younger, television stations went off the air at midnight. No late, late movies and no info-ads selling kitchen knife sets for "not $29.95, not $24.95, but just $19.95 if you call now."
Instead there was a test pattern displayed on the screen until dawn.
My British friends would watch that for hours. It evidently was as exciting as a 5-day Test Match.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

You need to make your speculations credible Johnnie.

And it may be your British friends were the type who knew that every once in a while some pirate broadcaster in a mobile caravanette had hacked the frequencies in the quiet of the early hours and screened a porn movie from a remote valley in Wales.

Just 5 hours until the kickoff of the 1st NFL season. New Orleans hosts Minnesota.
22 of us have made our picks for Week #1. If you would like to participate, please pick that game before the start of tonight's game.

22 players in with kickoff coming up in just 90 minutes.
20 of us have picked the defending champs New Orleans Saints to win tonight.
Only Rhys in Boston and Andy/Clubber in Charlottesville are going with the Minnesota Vikings.
Over on the Fantasy Football game, people there have both Brees and Favre on their teams, as well as both defenses and a few other characters.
I will be asleep well before the game ends.
I hope it is as good a game as it looks to be on paper.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

The Onion's analysis of the game is killin' me.
 
 
I getting very irritated with my espn game cast watching, plus their tickety boo Countdown Live. Waaaay worse than last year....
 
 
@ossobuco,

I'm getting very irritated with Al Michaels saying "New Orr-Lee-Ans".
 
 
@JPB,

Is it properly pronounced "Naw-lins?"
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Or, "Nor-lins" or even "New Orlins"
 
 
@JPB,

I think I say Nor-lins..

The good thing about game casts is that one doesn't have to tolerate the talking heads blabbering on. The bad thing - is you can't see the plays.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Cringe, my kicker will be the goat..
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I would place a tiny little "i" in front of Naw-Lins. Your tongue should start on the top of your mouth...just behind your front teeth. Not harshly below your bottom teeth.
 
 
Final score!
Naw lins 14
Vikings 9
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Strange game..
 
 
.The Onion ‎Minnesota Vikings Advice: If there was ever a time to intimidate a team by throwing a bunch of oil-soaked birds onto the 50-yard line, it is now.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Nope its Nawlins, I take credit for establishing that pronunciation of the Crescent City ever since I first posted about herein back in 2003.

Good Game btw.

@farmerman,

Not in the game are you fm? Are you frit of being humiliated by an effete Limey?

I'm in favour of allowing that you picked N.O. so you can join in. It isn't an advantage I expect will give me any trouble in conceeding.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm heading home, rjb! Keep the light on for me!
 
 
@CowDoc,

Excellent. I hope that, in the down time between games, you can talk about your trip.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

you run the motel 6?
 
 
@Rockhead,

Um. I am in talks with others.
No Motel 6...otherwise known as No Tell Motel. I drive by one or more of them early in the mornings. Often cop cars in the parking lots.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

You are the wise one.
Hold on to your socks.

@alex240101,

You can't pick Nawlins but the rest of the picks have been recorded...even the one for St Louis to beat Arizona.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Aw Johnnie. We can concede N.O to alex surely. It was a laydown. I feel sure he didn't know the result when he posted. You should be glad some people are a bit slow. It gives us movers and shakers an easier ride. Have you never given a lift to a lady who missed the last bus?

Six homosexuals are running for the last bus. You can tell they are homosexuals because they have just come out of a homosexual bar. One of them just misses before the doors hiss closed and the driver gives a backwards V sign through his side window.

Do you glide up in your limo to rescue him from his distress.

Some men have married a woman they met in that fashion. My parents met in a counterforce revolving door contretemps in The Metropole Hotel in Blackpool but I've told the story before although not my full version involving Sir Tom Finney's penalty miss the previous Saturday. And you wouldn't believe the fucking dynasty that spawned. In fact this post is one of the many results. And it's a lot better than any of the rest of the dynasty could do and that's a fucking fact.

It's amazing really. You wouldn't be reading this, which is by way of light entertainment before kick-off time, if Tom Finney had scored that penalty. And he had a great record in scoring penalties.

Everytime I see a field goal attempt sail inches wide, about one inch in Sir Tom's penalty case, only Sir Tom's flashed rather than sailed, hit a concrete stanchion behind the goal with a sickening thump and bounced back to the half-way line, I shake my head in wonderment.
 
 
@spendius,

Um, ok. There was a video yesterday of a goalkeeper who slapped away a penalty kick or free kick or something. He was quite proud of himself. He strutted. He raised his arms and pointed his fingers towards the sky, reveling in his glorious play.
The ball meanwhile, evidently still in play, had a mind of its own. It rolled towards and then into the goal. Cool.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Did it cause any conceptions?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Okay. Next to each team is the number of people who have selected that team to win. It appears as {#}

But wait! There is more!
Mysteryman wins the Congeniality Award this week. He agrees with the majority of us on every single game.
Johnboy, Cowdoc and Panzade agree with the majority on all but 1 game.
Edgar, Spendius and Fbaezer say nay to the rest of us on 2.
Ehbeth, Tico, Ragman and Lmur are at 3 while Region, McGentrix and Coastal think they are smarter then the rest of us on 4 games.
Osso, George, JPB and Lionx differ on 5 games from the majority followed by Andy, MsCowdoc and Alex at 6.
And then there are Jespah and Rhys, marching to their own drummers, who are out of the step with the rest of us on 8 games.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

it will be pretty funny if Oakland wins.

Thanks for all your efforts, rjb.

That wont happen again.
And dont forget that I changed my pick from pittsburg to atlanta.
 
 
Tighten your chinstraps and other straps. We are off and running big time!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

We've got the Giants game and the 49ers later and I think another one after that. Great innit? After a six hour cricket match just finished.

The Giants look a bit slow to me but I'm no expert am I?
 
 
I heard Terry Bradshaw say today that if he owned the Steelers he would get rid of Rothenberger.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

If he doesn't own the Steelers what's it got to do with him?
 
 
@spendius,

He has the bully pulpit on a nationally televised pregame show.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Terry and Ben have a long running thing going.

now that Ben has shown the rest of us what an idiot he is, Terry gets free shots at him...
 
 
@Rockhead,

He enjoys kicking folks when they are down does he?
 
 
Well, as Terry pointed out, he named one other player who was dropped by the Steelers for a lesser offence than that.
 
 
@spendius,

mebbe you should write in and defend Ben.

Terry would love you...
 
 
Bummer re Stafford..
 
 
I will not say the Texans have won. But at this point I am very proud of them.
 
 
I have learned from years here to never, never ever call a game until it is over. But Houston is looking good.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

And that's from a chap who has knocked seven bells of shit out of Texas's power elite because they don't want evolution theory being taught to their kids by a bunch of PC, atheistic, militant, feminist, homosexual, dictatorial lefties. And who else is going to teach a silly theory like that? Who else could?
 
 
@spendius,

footie spends. it's aboot the footie...

That should do it, edgar!

What are you on about, you idiot? Do you ever go back and read your own words? I bet even you could not decipher them after a day's time.
 
 
@JPB,

 
That should do it, edgar!

 

Best possible start to a season. My worry now is that they will experience a big letdown next week.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Houston at Washington next week, I believe.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Houston at Washington next week, I believe.

 

Houston has a way of losing to teams they ought to stomp into the turf.
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
footie spends. it's aboot the footie...
 

Sure it is Rockie. It's not about which side you're on depending on which leg you're standing. ed should be proud of the state's football team when it's getting pissed on. You've lost the football when it becomes a vehicle for your pride.
 
 
@spendius,

By the way Rockie--I'm not squeamish about fighting behind enemy lines.
 
 
Good afternoon from Virginia where it is a fine, fine day. I may have to fire up the wood stove in the A2K broadcast cabin in the woods. Fall is coming.
We have 10 games finished so far in the NFL.
Lmur, Liontamerx, Spendius, Edgar and Ragman picked correctly in 8 of those 10 games.
Alex, Fbaezer, Andy and Osso have mismanaged to choose 6 of the 10 games incorrectly.
 
 
I can tell spendi thinks everybody but himself is a fairweather fan. Screw what he thinks.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Not at all ed. Only those who show evidence of it.

I don't see sport as something to jack my ego off with. It's too important for a trivial thing like that.
 
 
@spendius,

As far as I am concerned you are the guy that brings the ants to a party. You can't allow something to be pleasant.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Well, this has been a proud start in good company..
 
 
My worst start yet. But some of my teams got close when they weren't posited to.
 
 
George and son Rhys were the only players to predict a Seattle win against San Francisco.
Through 13 games, I have Ragman, Spendius and Edgar at 10-3.
A bunch of us are at 9-4.
Alex has 8 losses, and there are others at 7.
 
 
The Cowboys/Redskins are in a strange situation. Can't wait to see how the second half transpires.
 
 
Holy crap. Did anybody pick the skins to beat Dallas?  
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I wished for it, does that count?
 
 
@edgarblythe,

wow

that was quite an ending!
 
 
I have been waiting a long time for the skins/Cowboys rivalry to become meaningful again. Could this be the beginning?
 
 
@edgarblythe,

The Miz says she picked the 'Skins.....gloatingly!
 
 
@CowDoc,

That was a really gutsy pick. She has moved herself up a notch and she already had my respect from past seasons.
 
 
The Detroit Lions were robbed.
Clearly a touchdown.
 http://jockpost.com/calvin-johnson-touchdown-overturned-lions-robbed-victory-bears-video/ 
 
 
@alex240101,

It looks a good touchdown to me. Why was it ruled out?
 
 
The clown did not get off to a good start in this football pickin thing. What does a clown know about football anyway.

@alex240101,

I know how that TD looks, but the rule was literally stated. Very bad rule with unjust result.
 
 
@Ragman,

It's a shame. He clearly had the ball.
 
 
@Ragman,

how is that different from a two-feet inbounds sideline catch where the receiver gets pushed out-of-bounds?
 
 
@edgarblythe,

 
Holy crap. Did anybody pick the skins to beat Dallas?  

 

Region, AndyClubber, McGentrix and MsCow!

Back in an hour or so with the week's results so far.
 
 
@alex240101,

 
The Detroit Lions were robbed.
Clearly a touchdown.

Not in the slightest. He didn't maintain possession upon hitting the ground. The rules are pretty clear - you have to hold on to the ball.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@alex240101,

I can see what they mean by there not being a second act. What is a second act exactly and why is such a rule in place? What is the rule trying to inhibit? It was a touchdown in rugby. Assuming the ball had been kicked rather than thrown.

I'm fascinated with the idea that the game developed all its methods deriving from the deliberate choice to outlaw the forward pass. As with baseball where the full-pitch is mandatory in opposition to cricket. Was it a petulant display of independence to diametrically alter those two fundamental rules?
From which the shape of the games has evolved to where they are now. And they don't export. No matter how much they are chanted up they just don't export. No World Cups. No Champion's League. It sounds like a chattering class jamboree actually. There are never any "can't hear a pin drop" moments.

Would men anywhere playing for big stakes develop the same systems, if they could afford it, if they started with those two rules of your's?
 
 
@edgarblythe,

There is the letter of the law which is senseless techincality and the spirit of the rule. He deserved the TD but the technicalities of the rule (whatever is written) prohibts thgen from awarding it. Detroit Lions were screwed. out of a win.
 
 
We Are From Washington And We Are Here To Help You.

That is the punchline to a quip about the scariest phrase in American English, with the "we" referring to government bureaucrats.
The Seahawks from Seattle, Washington and the Redskins from Washington, DC caused a lot of pain for most all of us on Sunday.
Only Rhys and George correctly picked Seattle while Region, AndyClubber, McGentrix and Ms Cowdoc had Washington.
And then there was the Houston win against Indianapolis. Only Osso, JPB and Edgar saw that one coming.
With 14 of the 16 games over with we have a 4-way tie at 10-4: Ragman, Edgar, Spendius and McGentrix. All 4 have San Diego tonight. Ragman has Baltimore in the second game tonight while the other 3 have the NY Giants. If NY wins we go to the tiebreaker (I will have to look up how that works from last year). Edgar has the final score as 30-13. Spendius sees it as 18-14 while McGentrix thinks 24-13 sounds good.
10 of us are at 9-5 so far, with 2 each at 8-6 and 7-7.
CoastalRat and Fbaezer are underwater at 6-8.
And then there is Alex who didn't pick in time for the Saints/Vikings game and went 4-9 in the other 13 games!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

that's our alex.

he's always got yer back...
 
 
So I've got to win twice tonight to get to.500. Piece of cake.
 
 
I was searching through last year's thread for the rules regarding tiebreakers here.
I stumbled across this nugget.
I found, CoastalRat, that Spendius won the game with a winning record of.711 while the player in 27th place was at.582. The median average was.654.
I tossed in the results from the self-proclaimed experts on ESPN. The best was at.684 while the worst was at.645.
 
 
Here are the rules regarding what happens if 2 or more players end a week with identical Win-Loss records. I take responsibility for them but JPB's fingerprints are also on them.
1) The player closest to the winning team's score.
2) The player closest to the losing team's score.
3) The player closest to the home team's score.
4) The player closest to the visiting team's score.
5) The player closest to the total points scored by the 2 teams.
6) The player who is ranked lowest in the standings here.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
I tossed in the results from the self-proclaimed experts on ESPN. The best was at.684 while the worst was at.645.
 

So we are better than the experts of ESPN and I made the biggest contibution.

Why are we not getting their money? It is a meritocracy isn't it or am I missing something?
 
 
@spendius,

 
So we are better than the experts of ESPN and I made the biggest contribution.

 

Median average, Spendi.
 
 
I remember my worst score ever, when I only got 3 games right.

Sigh, I had picked Washington on page 2 of this thread, and changed it..
 
 
RJB, I think I'm in Coastal Rat and Fbaezer's camp, 6-8.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Congratulations, Osso. You and the clown and the Mexican are at 6-8.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thank you, thank you.<starts to tap dance>

@JPB,

if that wasn't the worst display of offense in MNF history, it was the second worst...
P.U. !
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks for your timely diligence at delivering the results. Also thanks for posting last season's stats. These first games were some pretty fun matches to watch. Gotta thank my lucky stars that my new g/f liked watching most of NYJ-Balt Raven game, too. The day before we had the Sunday's games on (w/o sound) at her dinner party. Pretty cool. My dog. Brady the wonder Border Collie, kept me informed of how I was doing in the contest.

You mean San Francisco? (Kidding, but that was also baaaad)

Well crap. So what you are telling me is that I had better pick up the pace a bit or I'm in deep doo-doo?
 
 
@Region Philbis,

I could not believe my eyes (or the NYJ first-down stats) at the relative lack of abilities to score a TD by both sides. Can both of these defenses be that good or is it just that the offenses are that inept?
 
 
@Ragman,

little of both, i suspect.
you know your offense sucks when you only manage to convert one 3rd down in a game -- no defense is that good...

one of the globe writers said that when belichick puts together the jets video package for them to study this week,
he should set it to the theme from Benny Hill...
 
 
@Region Philbis,

The Jets were more inept than the 'Boys- Hard to believe.
Congrats Rag dude.
 
 
WEEK #1 RESULTS & STANDINGS
...And it ain't pretty as we did as badly as some of the NFL teams. I have always heard that the defenses tend to gel faster than the offenses. That certainly seems to be true.
1) Ragman finishes at 11-5 (.688) and takes the early lead
2) Right behind at 10-6 (.623)
Region
Edgar
Spendius
McGentrix
Ms Cowdoc
The Best ESPN expert
7) There are a bunch at 9-7 (.563)
Johnboy
EhBeth
Tico
JPB
Jespah
Liontamerx
Cowdoc
Lmur
George
Panzade
17) Breaking even at 8-8 (.500)
Mysteryman
AndyClubber
Rhys
20) Osso endures a losing week, going 7-9 (.438)
The worst ESPN expert meets the same fate
21) Deeper underwater at 6-10 (.375) are
CoastalRat
Fbaezer
23) Alex -way out there in the 23rd column of my scorecard- thinks that is where he is supposed to finish- 5-10 (.333). We may have to explain what the goal here is.

We, as a group, went 199-168 (.542). That is probably one of our worst results in the history of this A2K game.
Onward and upward!

By the way, congratulations to Jespah and Alex. They alone had Kansas City over San Diego.

I will be back in a bit with the schedule for Week #2. There is no Thursday night game.

@Cycloptichorn,

cyclo: hang in there if you can with this. I'll bet soon you'll get into it more. I just never got into fantasy football, but this is fun for me. Within the first few weeks there's a challenge...as the drama of games, the rash of injuries to key players and the coming together (or falling apart) of teams happens. It's fun being lulled into the false belief that you can predict the outcomes of such an impossible set of variables and that you're not just lucky as hell.

@Cycloptichorn,

Duly noted. Glad to be of service to you.  
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Yeah Cyclo--keep going. I like the idea that a stupid Limey can demonstrate that what you know about your national sport is likely to be synergetic with what you know about any other national issues.

"Losing interest" is only a cliched euphemism for having the collywobbles about not being able to shine in No Sophistry (spin) Zones. Everybody knows a simple thing like that.
 
 
Ouch! Worse then being described as living in an ivory tower in the liberal University of California-Berkeley is the allegation that Cyclo has "collywobbles."
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Better that than to be a useless drunk, like some here.

Excellent. 7 players have picked so far. I need to start studying...or tossing darts.
Ehbeth used to choose, as I recall, on which QB had the cuter butt. I am not making that up.
 
 
There will be more than a couple of games separating me from ragman this time around.
 
 
You and Ragman differ on 4 games, Edgar. You and Jespah differ on 7!
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I may not be done with my picks because I'm traveling to upstate NY to party hardy to celebrate my 60th birthday. So I've passed in my picks early. If I get a chance to log on while I'm away, I might make a change or two by Saturday.

This is going to be a total thrill...as friends from Boston will travel to Albany NY...some friends from 40 yrs back at college will come out. U gotta love Facebook.

Tired as hell, but it's really good to be back where temps are in the seventies and humidity in the teens. Both were in the nineties in Shanghai. I walked in the rain in Suzhow and wasn't a damned bit wetter than I was before or after. More later....off to the corrals.

@realjohnboy,

11 players have made picks for Week #2.

I am sure you had an interesting trip, Cowdoc. Here in Virginia, by the way, the drought is taking a bite. A farmer I know got rid of 1/3rd of his beef cattle this week due to a lack of feed.
 
 
@Ragman,

Ok...yet again, I request a change. This last one consists of changing to Atlanta triumphing over AZ.

Thanks for indulging me.

@Ragman,

No problem, Ragman. Your revised, revised and revised list leaves out Miami vs Minnesota. You originally chose the Vikings. I assume you are sticking with that...for the moment.
 
 
Ok, I agree re the Giants. But wait, I did badly last week...

Sunday, September 19th

back with the final score in a bit

edit - 24 - 10
 
 
Good morning! Kickoff for Week #2 is just over 2 hours away.

As a group (of 23 players so far) we are in strong agreement on most of the games. All of us have New England over the Jets. Only Jespah is picking Buffalo vs Green Bay. Rhyss and Alex pick Miami against Minnesota and they are the only two players who think San Francisco will triumph over New Orleans.
AndyClubber, Fbaezer and, of course, Alex believe Detroit will beat Philadelphia. AndyClubber, Region and Rhys choose Chicago vs Dallas.
The closest we come to being evenly split are in the games between Seattle (14 votes) vs Denver (9) and Oakland (14) vs St Louis (9).

Liontamerx and Panzade agree with the majority on every game. McGentrix, Cowdoc, CoastalRat and Fbaezer are right behind at 1.
Alex is out of step with the majority on a stunning 9 games. AlexClubber is at 8.
The majority of us are picking 10 of the 16 home teams to win.

edit: EhBeth's picks came in while I was writing this.
 
 
Important game for the Lions.
Stafford out, Hill in.
League extended ticket selling television blackout deadline for twenty four hours. Fans met the need. Lions will win.
Next two Lion meals, Minny and brunch at Lambeau, will send p r i d e home to another, no deadline extension will be needed, Ford field sell out, to Staffords return.
Hula, hula, Hawaii Five and O.

I have the Steelers/Titans on. It's a street brawl, so far.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

By the way, for anyone who gives a sh*t, Edgar had a birthday this weekend.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks for mentioning it, rjb. I had more greetings this year than ever before in my life. Wonderful to feel the love.
 
 
Steelers had to change quarterbacks - new guy immediately fumbled the ball.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Oops. AndyClubber, an avid Steelers fan, must be getting nervous. Ben is suspended, Dixon is hurt and Batch is the only QB left. Leftwich was released on Saturday.
Batch isn't a bad QB, I guess. But...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

The Steelers are afraid to throw the ball, I think.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

With a 16-3 lead, that is probably a decent strategy. But there is a quarter to go.
 
 
Cowboys trailing by ten. I did not see that coming.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I have no idea why Cutler just kneeled on 3rd down.
 
 
@JPB,

I think they can run the clock. Well done, Bears.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

And so they did, rjb. I picked mostly home teams this week. I'm not having a very good week so far.
 
 
I tried to warn y'all 'bout my dolphins.

nobody listened...
 
 
@Rockhead,

I wonder if dolphins can be used for sushi.
 
 
Good gracious!! Black Sunday.
 
 
@spendius,

An onside kick works for Detroit?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

But the Lions become toothless as Hill throws 4 incomplete passes.
 
 
Black Sunday. Indeed, we are not looking well through 9 early games.
Osso, AndyClubber and Rhys are 6-3 while EhBeth, George, Edgar and Cyclo are at 5-4.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Day-um, I shoulda started Bradford (on the FFootball game). Oh, and Maclin, double day-um.
 
 
The afternoon games should be a pick-up.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

A bunch of us, Edgar, picked Houston because you seemed confident. We will be upset with you if you lead us astray.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm giving Houston my tough stare. Oh, and same with Oakland.
 
 
As I recall, I mentioned that Houston has a habit of losing to teams it ought to beat.
 
 
I've just seen three Jet's touchdowns, the second for the extra point, where the Pats defence just stood aside. That's what it looked like to me. We are not used to defenders allowing that sort of space. When the ball can be seen coming for 4 or 5 seconds. Namanda Vidic would have stopped the lot with his bare head.
 
 
Texans/Washington now in overtime.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

They shoulda tried for 3.

Easy for me to say, but...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

That the heckity heck heck happened to the Patriots!?
 
 
I think I would have tried the three. But right now Texans get the ball back. They better play good this time.
 
 
@ehBeth,

no kidding
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Ok, my stare helped both Houston and Oakland...
I forgot to stare at New England, and see what happened.
 
 
I have Osso and Edgar at 9-5. They agree on New Orleans but Osso has the Giants tonight while Edgar has Indy.
Several folks are at 8-6 but none of them seem to be positioned to win the week.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I think Edgar will prevail, but y'never know. At any rate, this is an improvement over my last week's grim numbers (ai, chihuahua!)
 
 
Must've been a bit of an unnerving day for Rackers.. (he'd only gotten 2/3 on previous attempts).
 
 
I love the skins, but I am a Texans fan before them.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Thanks for putting the eyeball on Houston.
 
 
@ehBeth,

You're welcome.

The eyeball isn't working for the Giants so far..
 
 
@ehBeth,

basically they stopped playing after randy's one-handy...
 
 
Indy wins.
And Edgar will win the week!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Congratulations, Edgar!
 
 
I have put in a notch what I have learned in RJB's A2K NFL Pick-Um Game, as I had an epiphany this night. A revelation.

I think it's a very interesting piece of knowledge I'm glad to share with you:
In the NFL, any given Sunday any given team can beat any other given team.
 
 
First place can be such a fleeting plateau (does that work?). As the season progresses, I have traditionally fallen to the lower echelons. Mainly because I don't do any real homework. But it's nice. Thanks folks.

Ah, the first of what is sure to be many "our-football-is-better-than-your-football" posts from Spendi.

Although he's a very good defender, had Vidic gone for the ball he more than likely would have been promptly buried in the ground like a shrub.
 
 
@fbaezer,

 
In the NFL, any given Sunday any given team can beat any other given team.
 

Yes indeed.

Yet another reason the NFL is better than the Premiere League.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I prefer "greasy pole" or "sitting duck position".
 
 
I think I am firing Prof. BillyBob as my football score advisor. I'll have better luck letting my dog pick the winners. One bark for the visitor, two barks for the home team.
 
 
I can't believe how many here were dead convinced that the Giants were going to win last night.

Ah, the first of what is sure to be many "our-football-is-better-than-your-football" posts from Spendi.
 

Not at all Tico. I don't think our football is better than your's. The world might do but I don't. I was making another point. I think your football is a brilliant adaptation to American states of mind. Just as our's is to our's.

And as one might expect given the experience of the management of the two versions. To say one is better than the other is to say something about the relative merits of the authorities who run these businesses.

I don't know the reason for you having so short a season that the teams cannot play each other home and away. With 32 teams it would require 62 games to do that. How many home games does the average NFL team play in a season on full throttle? Why are rich Americans invested in our football so heavily? And others.

Maybe the social life that goes with your football is not as exotic as it is in our's. Too clean-cut. More provincial. Noveau Rich. You know? Like a lottery winner in the owner's bar at Ascot.
 
 
@spendius,

 
I don't know the reason for you having so short a season that the teams cannot play each other home and away.
 

Injury. It's a tough sport and as the season goes on the injuries really pile up.

16 not counting the playoffs - and that's every team in the league, they all play an equal number of games every year.

@Cycloptichorn,

Injuries pile up in every sport where men put their bodies under as much stress as they dare.

Your answer suggests you know little about sport and then there's only vicarious machismo involved.

I could offer an explanation involving geographical distances and the expense of travelling with a large entourage.
 
 
@spendius,

  the idea that Soccer leads to as many injuries as Football is a joke. In one sport collisions are avoided if unnecessary, in the other, collisions are the entire point. There really is no comparison.

The NFL is a blood sport, much more so than soccer. They play 16 games in the regular season. Too many injuries to play any more games. (I'll remind you, as I did last year about this time, that you and I have previously compared the number of injuries in the Premiere League with the NFL, and the NFL has MUCH more injuries.)

 
Why are rich Americans invested in our football so heavily? And others.
 

I dunno... why'd the rich Russian dude buy the Nets... who's to say.
 
 
Congrats to Edgar.

GEAUX SAINTS!!!
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

 
I can't believe how many here were dead convinced that the Giants were going to win last night.
 

I said they would win @ home. The reason was apparent. Lucas field is a loud stadium which makes it hard for offensive linemen to hear the count and def ends have a field day(Freeney and Mathis).

If you noticed, Indy has a guard looking through his legs at Manning for the kick that signals hike. He then taps the center to convey the message. All the while Saturday, the center who calls out instructions can keep his head up and his eye on the defensive alignments.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Look Tico--I don't think our football is better than your's and I explained why. All sport is at a similar level when there's enough money in it to attract the best players and to get them to exert themselves. I enjoy your game on Sunday night just as much as I enjoy any other game. Men at work with no words to spin with. And chance playing a part.

You have a big lead in relation to conspicuous consumption. And I still think that having fatties as youth icons is a flaw.
 
 
@panzade,

Wow, I didn't know that. But why wouldn't the guard be responsible for barking out instructions while the center watches for Manning's signal?
 
 
@spendius,

 
Look Tico--I don't think our football is better than your's...
 

Fine, I share that view. As I've explained before, I love both NFL football and soccer. I suppose it's been your incessant questioning about why the NFL doesn't do everything as well as the Premier League that has caused me to leap to my irrational conclusion.

 
You have a big lead in relation to conspicuous consumption. And I still think that having fatties as youth icons is a flaw.
 

Well, there you go again.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

But you do have a big lead in that respect.

In the lower leagues where there is little gate money or ads do the players have to buy their own kit and what does it cost?
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

 
the idea that Soccer leads to as many injuries as Football is a joke.
 

There are 20 clubs in our Premier League with squads of 25. They play 38 matches per season plus cup-ties and for the top 8 clubs European home and away fixtures. At the moment there are 74 players out injured after 5 matches.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Thought Michael Vick was gonna snatch defeat from the jaws of Victory for the Iggles. ANYWAY, with the Pillies on such a hot streak in the NL, fooball's gonna have to wait a bit, I cant multitask anymore.
 
 
@spendius,

 
At the moment there are 74 players out injured after 5 matches.
 

If those little ponces tried to play Football, there would be 400 injuries. American Footballers play through pain constantly; you have to be seriously injured to end up 'out.'

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Because Jeff Saturday, the center is a football genius. He'll end up a coach
 
 
@panzade,

Interesting. Thank you.
Do the other players on the Indy defense know when the ball is being hiked based on shouts from Saturday/Manning?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

plus, the center needs to keep his head up in order to defend the rushers
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Don't be so ridiculous Cyclo. Semi-crocks, quarter-crocks or slight-crocks can't live in a game at these levels. Are you saying crocks can do their job for the team. Any-crock is soon identified and his weakness exploited.

Your parading of your lack of knowledge of top level sport is pathetic. Proper liberal lefties don't do sport. You're using the players to try to look like one of the boys. You should be more interested in Scrabble. And recipes.

Mmm-hmm. Why do you sit around pretending that your Nancy boys are really tough guys? They wouldn't last a single quarter in the real game. Probably not even a single series. In pro football nobody flops for the Refs - unlike some pussy sports I could mention.

As far as we can tell, crockery is the essence of soccer. The heart of it. Faking fouls because you don't have the stones to win without it.

I wouldn't say that about your Rugby players, however. Those guys have what it takes. If you bunch respected actual strength and toughness more than you do boyish good looks and artful flippy-flopping, you would promote Rubgy over Soccer as your national sport. But that doesn't seem to be the case.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

There's not a rugby player in the world who wouldn't give his teeth to be playing in the English Premier league.

Don't keep digging Cyclo.

National sports are chosen by acclamation. A profoundly democratic process.
 
 
@spendius,

 
There's not a rugby player in the world who wouldn't give his teeth to be playing in the English Premier league.
 

That wouldn't leave them with many teeth, now would it, considering?

I also think this comment is full of shit. Surely some of them actually prefer the sport of Rugby, wouldn't you think?

I know your favorite passtime (other than drinking till you pass out) is taking a piss at people online. But the truth is that I know more about Soccer than you will ever know about Football. I've probably forgotten more about Football then you've ever known about Soccer.

Inserting lame insults and attempting pithy statements every now and then isn't a substitute for actual knowledge about a game, Spendi. If you really want to be some sort of online trash-talker, you'll have to step your game up considerably.

That's just words Cyclo. It means absolutely fuck all.

I only began to learn about your football when I joined Johnny's game. The technicalities are nothing. It's chaps fighting over money (females) in a fairly humane fashion determined by the rules designed by the squeamish and posited upon the spectacular moment which allows fans to escape from themselves temporarily. The differences are cultural. Like your culture thinks that the above quoted assertions have meaning and my culture doesn't.

Unless it's fixed.

Like your culture thinks that the above quoted assertions have meaning and my culture doesn't.
 

There's probably a much deeper point that could be discussed, re: the inability of your culture to understand things. But instead, I'll knock off work early and pull a Spendi by hitting the pub.

Half-time. Saints (9) vs 49's (7).
They are putting us all to sleep for the night here in the home. Two blue pills and one yellow one.
See you all tomorrow for results on what looks like another bad week for many of us.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Night, RJ.

I'm enjoying following the game. I've been worried about my 49ers. When I watched the starting minutes, I was disgusted after the interception and went to the kitchen to finish making ice cream.

I came back some time later, and SF was holding it's own.
Up to the half, anyway.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Holy cow, SF and NO at 22-22 with 1 minute 19 sec to go...

If sf wins, Singletary will one happy guy..

C'mon, defense.

Uh oh..

With 2 seconds, my fantasy football guy got the field goal for NO. Yikes, that was close.

Kenny McKinley found dead at home

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Denver Broncos wide receiver Kenny McKinley was found dead in his home Monday in an apparent suicide.

Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said authorities were called to McKinley's home in Centennial at 3:35 p.m. local time and found his body in the second-floor master bedroom. He said detectives believe McKinley, 23, was killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Robinson said authorities were called by a female friend of McKinley's who discovered the body after returning from an errand with his child. The sheriff declined to say if authorities found a suicide note.

"It's still part of our investigation and probably nothing we'll talk about right now," he said.

McKinley's death is the latest in a series for tragedies for the Broncos in recent years. Cornerback Darrent Williams was slain in a drive-by shooting on New Year's Day 2007 and three months later backup running back Damien Nash collapsed and died after a charity basketball game in St. Louis.

Reggie Bush has a broken fibula (I can relate...) and could be out for six weeks.

He's had some a pretty rough fall, all things considered.
 
 
WEAK #2 RESULTS:
Week #2 turns out to be worse then Week #1! As a group we finish at.536 vs.542.
Edgar wins the week with a record of 11-5 which is the same as Ragman when he won Week #1. The best expert on ESPN also scores an 11-5.
Osso, JPB, Rhys, Spendius, Liontamerx, George, Panzade and Cyclo come in at 10-6.
9-7 is where EhBeth, Tico, McGentrix, Cowdoc, CoastalRat and Fbaezer land.
Ragman, AndyClubber and Lmur break even at 8-8.
Region and MsCowdoc could only manage to go 7-9. Johnboy, Jespah and Mysteryman stagger in at 6-10 and find only a little solace from the fact that they were matched by the worst ESPN guy.
And then there is Alex who scores a 5-11 to go with his 5-11 in Week #1.

The home teams go 7-9 vs 12-4 in Week #1.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

STANDINGS:
1) Edgar combines two decent weeks and is at.656;
2) Spendius and Cyclo, with.625, is a game back - tieing the best ESPN picker;
4) JPB, Ragman, McGentrix, Liontamerx, George and Panzade are at.594;
10) Ehbeth, Tico, Rhys and Cowdoc follow with.563;
14) Osso, Region, MsCowdoc and Lmur are above break even at.531;
18) AndyClubber is at.500;
19) Johnboy, Jespah, CoastalRat and Fbaezer stumble along at.469, joined by the worst ESPN expert;
23) Mysteryman, at.438, is grateful that Alex is playing;
24) Alex hangs onto the cellar spot at.323.

It is far too early to panic, of course. If a few people can pull off a decent string of successful picks we can get to a much closer bunching of players, particularly in the middle of the pack.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
It is far too early to panic, of course.

Texans left tackle Duane Brown has joined outside linebacker Brian Cushing on the NFL’s suspended list.

Brown was suspended for four games today for violating the league’s policy against performance-enhancing drugs. His suspension comes at a bad time because the unbeaten Texans are hosting the Dallas Cowboys and outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, one of the NFL’s premier pass rushers.

Brown will be replaced by Rashad Butler. Butler’s role as the swing tackle behind Brown and right tackle Eric Winston will be taken by Ephraim Salaam, who will be signed for his third tour of duty with the Texans.

Brown will be eligible to return after the Kansas City game on Oct. 17.

“First off, I want to personally apologize to (owner Bob) Mr. McNair, coach (Gary) Kubiak and the rest of the coaching staff, my teammates, family and to all the great and loyal Texans fans,” Brown said in a statement. “I take full responsibility for putting myself in this situation. I unknowingly took a supplement tainted with a banned substance and now have to deal with the consequences.”

If Brown had filed an appeal, he could have continued to play until commissioner Roger Goodell made a ruling.

“After reviewing the appeal process and speaking with legal counsel, I have decided not to appeal my suspension,” Brown said. “I understand the rules and accept my punishment. I vow to learn from this mistake and be a better player and teammate because of it.”

Brown was the team’s first-round draft choice in 2008. He was mentored that season by Salaam, who had helped mentor Charles Spencer in 2006.

“We are disappointed that Duane Brown has been suspended,” general manager Rick Smith said in a statement. “This is a significant blow to our team. Our players have to understand that they are responsible for what goes into their bodies and that they take risks anytime they use a supplement not approved by the NFL.

“Our head athletic trainer (Geoff Kaplan), head strength and conditioning coach (Cedric Smith) as well as our team nutritionist (Roberta Anding) have had many meetings and presentations constantly reminding our players about the dangers of the supplement industry and risks associated with taking non-approved products.

“I am confident in our coaches and our players that we will work through this adversity and continue to play winning football.”
 
 
Makes me indecisive about Sunday's game.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

makes me indecisive about my supplements.

what if they're tainted, too...???
 
 
@Rockhead,

Brown apparently knew he was doing something wrong at the time.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I think so too...
 
 
@edgarblythe,

i think they'll do just fine without him.
OT's tend to be replaceable parts...
 
 
@edgarblythe,

But ed--if taking performance enhancing drugs is cheating, which I don't think it is btw, then the two wins of the Texans were unsportingly and illegally obtained and you should volunteer to have two points knocked off your correct predictions and two added to your incorrect ones.

They beat the Colts by 10 in Week 1 and the Redskins by 3 (in OT) in Week 2. It is reasonable to put both wins down to the drugs.

The England football captain Rio Ferdinand was suspended for 8 months (a season) for avoiding a drugs test. No proof he had taken anything.

What are "approved products" and how are they identified? The game itself has risks. If risk is a consideration the game should be abolished.

It seems to me that this whole business of approved and non-approved substances is nothing but an excuse to add another layer to the bureaucracy of people who like bossing others and thus to increase ticket prices for those who pay to see enhanced performance. Are any of the bureaucrats taking substances?
 
 
@spendius,

Your suggestion might approach reasonable if we knew 100% that there were no cheaters on the opposing teams.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

We assume innocence until proof is provided ed. Remember the 11th commandment.

You couldn't determine levels of theft or adultery solely on the basis of the numbers caught.

Every player could be tested.

And labs are working overtime to find new substances which enhance performance but are not yet detectable. And they are good at it. And the demand is real because otherwise they wouldn't invest in it.

The whole business is an ever expanding industry for well paid bureaucrats which the fans pay for in ticket prices.
 
 
@spendius,

La la la - In the meantime there is a real situation on the ground.  
 
 
@edgarblythe,

But it isn't real ed. It's rigged.

Isn't training itself performance enhancing. If two teams came on the pitch who had all finished a week's work late Friday afternoon the game would still take place. In fact in the lower leagues that happens.

It was a regular occurence in the club I used to frequent that when somebody made a 50 0r more break at snooker they were accused of having a secret practice table at home. That they were cheating in other words.

That was real enough.
 
 
@spendius,

Yes yes. Go on.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

The top players are working men. Their job is to put eyes on adverts. They are sandwich-board men like those in Ulysses who each carried a letter and when they stood in the correct formation they spelled HEALYS. Or HEALY'S.

Like all other matters involving men and money it is fiendishly complex. The movie Chariots of Fire took a poke at training. It saved everybody's face that the runner training under a coach after he was beaten was Jewish and the poke could be labelled anti-semitic. Which is an obvious non sequitur.

Why should sportsmen be banned from taking substances that other working men take to improve their performances? If ever something is unconstitutional I think that is.
 
 
@spendius,

Does anyone else understand this rant?
 
 
@Ragman,

I think he's saying that the NFL's substance abuse policy is slipshod when compared to the English soccer leagues, that practicing snooker is cheating, and that all working men -- be they Jewish or not -- ought to be able to eat sandwiches without fear of reprisal.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Wow! I'm impresed. Ever think about getting a translator's job at the United Nations?
 
 
@Ragman,

The only thing I understand is that once again our Limey has hijacked a fun thread full of camaraderie and friendly banter and turned it into a soapbox for his hysterical and obscure rantings.

In all the years I have been associated with this thread; first running it and then enjoying jrb's expert guidance, I have never seen such a sore loser and what's worse, sore winner.

And it's not like we haven't sent kudos his way. I know I have congratulated him many times for his win last year. But that's not enough. In the last few pages he has suggested edgar give up his 2 wins because the Texans had a man using steroids and he has started his campaign to belittle Cyclo and Tico and anyone else who might give him a run for his money.

This is bad form. Certainly not the fair play taught on the fields of Eton. The gracious winner, the gracious loser; all are missing in post after post.

I had a belly full of it last year and lost interest, and it's only the second week and I've had a belly full already.

This is a public forum and no one can be or should be excluded from its threads, within reason. But I'll be damned if I'm going to sit through another football season with a megalomaniac shoving his diatribes down my throat in order to prove his "cleverness".

Get your shit together pal.
 
 
@panzade,

methinks you take him a mite too seriously, panz...

(think of a frilly blouse when you read it...like Jerry's pirate shirt)
 
 
@Rockhead,

I calls 'em like I sees 'em.
 
 
@panzade,

Sadly, I must admit to having a (lesser) problem with this behavior particularly, I object to carrying over political harangues from other A2K threads, calling people out and that 'sore winner/sore-loser' behavior is not something that's AT ALL entertaining to me. It's not in the spirit of fun and friendliness that's been the history here and I would think seriously about my future participation. I've spoken/written of this same issue in private at the end of last NFL season.

I could over-simplify the issue by advising use of the ignore function; however, because of the nature and extent of the issue, it might not be so useful. We are a group of affable people who are playing for the sport and fun. I would NOT want to see anyone fall out - nor would I want to drive someone away who might be able to reform the objectionable behavior.
Perhaps this behavior can be curtailed? And might the political harangues that follow from other treads be curtailed? This is (and was) a rant-free
zone. Shall we continue in that tradition?
 
 
I'm not upset by spendi's diatribes/rants in the least. He can be, at times, like a silly blouse, and he's at least that dangerous. Before we had the wonderful little "ignore" option at this site, we were forced to manually ignore folks that rankled us. My suggestion, for those who do not enjoy playing with spendi -- and I mean in the sense that a cat plays with its food -- is just ignore him.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Just to clarify one point. I won't put spendius on ignore because I sometimes enjoy his posts on the religion and evolution threads.

I'm just asking him as ragman did, to leave that stuff out of this NFL football thread and be a little more gracious. Sort of take a clue from edgar who's self-deprecating humour is so endearing.
 
 
@panzade,

Pan, I'm totally with you on this.

I'm glad that not too many people 'quote' him anymore when responding.
 
 
This thread is supposed to be where we take a break from every other thread.
As an example, I get along with several people on this thread, yet on the other threads we are involved in we disagree about everything.

Spendius hasnt learned how to do that yet, but given time and a little guidance he might.

@realjohnboy,

 
. Thanks for playing this silly game.
 

We all don't think it's silly Johnny. You can see from some posts just above that there are players who take it really, really seriously. As long as the dead space of midweek is being taken up with matters they approve of from which one might learn absolutely fuck all. It's as if they can't imagine that there may be other viewers here who find my contributions of some interest, however slight, and that they are the ones I compose my compostitions for.

And I only made a superficial comment or two about a report another member posted so that the conversation he had initiated would not fizzle out and dribble away like piss in a dusty gutter on a hot day does but would instead develop and possibly become a subject he could be proud of having raised and from which something might be learned. The only thing you can learn from piss dribbling down a dusty gutter on a hot day is that liquids go downhill when they can and that piss is immiscible with dry dust and shoots across it like quicksilver.

My picks will arrive before the deadline assuming I don't pass mine first.

I like silly games. All blouses do.
 
 
Is a "pass rusher" a player who gets the ball from the quarter-back in a hand over as distinguished from a receiver ( a rather feminine word) getting it thrown at him. The bloke you want for a 4th on the one yard line I mean.
 
 
@spendius,

running backs (and full backs to a lesser degree) are the ones who usually receive a hand-off from the quarterback.

pass rushing is done by the defensive linemen...

@Region Philbis,

 
pass rushing is done by the defensive linemen...
 

Thanks Philbion Regis. His task is to rush towards a pass to minimise its effect or even turn it to advantage? Is that right?
 
 
@spendius,

Of the 11 guys on the defensive team, 6 might be deployed on the line while the other 5 work to protect against a pass. Perhaps 3 of the 6 focus on stopping a running play. The others, the pass rushers, try to break through the offensive line to pressure the QB. They can not allow him to stand back there getting a lot of time to find a target.
The allocation of defensive resources depends on the situation. If it is 3rd down and 10, a pass rather than a rush can be expected. Fewer guys will be deployed to protect against an unlikely running play. More will rush and more will cover potential pass catchers.
It is actually quite a chess match, Spendi.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
It is actually quite a chess match, Spendi.
 

It always is when men and large sums of money and pride are involved. You should see what they get up to in pigeon racing and giant marrow growing. To suggest that one competitive activity is cleverer than another is to misunderstand the nature of human beings.

Take label design for jam and lemon cheeses for example.

And young men can normally be expected to be a bit slow on the uptake. You missed out the word speed. It's speed chess. Ordinary chess is crap for spectators. Mistakes are the essence. Who makes the least wins usually.

Can-can dancers compete to win the adoration of the fat-cats on the front row. Which is quite a chess match too although some of the more obvious moves are banned for various reasons.

You are in exceptionally rare form this evening, Spendius.
I certainly won't speak for all of us, dude, but I do enjoy mid-week chatter. We just need to respect (methinks) that there is a boundary. I can't and won't try to say where that is.

From John McClain's blog, about Cowboys Texans:

Now, who do you think is going to win this game?

The Texans are favored by three. They've won six in a row. They're 10-3 against the NFC, including 1-0 this season, over the last four years.

But I think back to last year when the Cowboys were supposed to get obliterated at New Orleans. They came up with their best game. Can they come up with their best game at Reliant Stadium?

I think both teams will move the ball through the air. I think this one comes down to one of the quarterbacks, Matt Schaub or Tony Romo, taking over the game.

I think the Cowboys will contain Arian Foster. I think the Texans will shut down the Cowboys' running game. This one will be won through the air.

This game will feature superb receivers, hard hitting from the front sevens and big plays on both sides of the ball.

I'm a big fan of Gary Kubiak and Wade Phillips. I feel bad that one has to lose. I think Wade will be 0-3.
 
 
I gave BillyBob 2 weeks to see what he could do and look where it got me. So now I'm gonna give his pet possum a chance. I'm hoping I correctly understood him correctly.

@edgarblythe,

ed's listening to the wind up merchants. I don't take any notice of those silly sods.

I know what you're going to say-- the wind up merchants sell tickets and selling a lot of tickets brings money in and it is trying to get that money that makes it competitive and that is what's good. Okay.. I accept that.

But I don't take any notice of them. They make me laugh. That made me laugh ed. I bet it made the footballers laugh as well.
 
 
I don't give a shit how you feel about it, spendi. I have been second guessing my choice of Houston all week, but can't come up with sufficient reason to change it.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Toss up and get the decision fixed. Have you ever tossed a coin with a mate in a bar to decide who is taking who before you move in on the two exotic creatures chatting on their stools? Predicting a football result is nothing to get lathered up about.
 
 
@spendius,

You old trash talker. I suggest you take your own advice.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I know what you mean about the Texans. And the other ? for me is the Jets, the hooligans, comin down to S Florida. Can they get it together?
 
 
@panzade,

I picked the Jets. About a third of the games were very hard for me to choose this week.

I picked the Jets. About a third of the games were very hard for me to choose this week.

 

Miami's RBs torched the Jets defense last year, who don't have Revis now.. And Miami's Defense held Adrian Peterson from scoring on the goal line 4 times in a row last week....

@panzade,

 
Ifn you ain't wafflin', you ain't tryin'

 

This is the only game I'm really up in the air about. I feel that Tenn's offense is one-dimensional and the Giants have had some success against that this year; they'll plug the gap and force Vince to pass, which doesn't always go that well. Plus, the Giants are at home and will be smarting from last week's blowout by Indy.

But Johnson... he can break big runs. Aaargh.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

This game ended up being the puzzler. The G-men are a good team playing way below their ability. I'm counting on them to suck it up at home and clobber the Titans.

@realjohnboy,

RJB: I've landed and I'm back at home now. I've made up a preliminary set of picks, but rather than confuse the issue, I'll think a little bit longer before finalizing. The only reason I waffled last week was due to my traveling. Now that I've reached 60, I'm so much more mature and decisive. Amazing transition, huh?!

Deciding on the Jets, Pitt, and Dallas matches are still driving me nuts.

Don't believe it, Raggy. Indecisiveness will return.

Did you have a great time? Now that you're older and wiser, what about them cowboys..
 
 
@ossobuco,

I can't decide on how indecisive I really am.

Seriously, I so enjoyed being able to visit and celebrate   my 60th with my dear friends. That's one thing about which I'm very decisive!  
 
 
@Ragman,

 
 
 
@CowDoc,

 
... the old cowpuncher.....

 

Do you know anything about cow tipping? When I was a teenager, that was a hell of a lot of fun.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

At the time it was. The consequences are another matter.
 
 
@spendius,

Ah, yes. Like many actions we took in our youth, there are consequences.
 
 
@ehBeth,

TY, kindly, EhB!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

The only cow tipping with which I am personally familiar involves the miserable buggers trying to tip over on top of me. Since I am no longer quite as quick and fleet of foot as I once was, I try to avoid such situations whenever possible these days.
 
 
Not to stray from the subject of cow tipping (I leave 20%), but here are my feeble picks for the week.

Niners

@realjohnboy,

 
Ah, yes. Like many actions we took in our youth, there are consequences.

 

now see here, what kind of response is that to the announcement of Ragman's recent birthday!

 
 
 
@CowDoc,

When I was about 16 or 17 (oops, not me but rather "someone I knew") cow tipping was pretty big.
The new college kids would come to UVA from New York or wherever. Rich urban yankees. Eager-to-be frat boys with money and fake id's.
Some redneck with a quick wit would offer to introduce them to "cow tipping."
Cows sleep standing up in the field was the story. If you walked up to one quietly at night and pushed in the right direction it would fall over. That would be funny.
The guide would herd the kids, in the expensive car their daddy had sent them to college with, on a circuitous route to some field where there were cows. He drank as much of their beer as he could and tucked a few cans in his jacket. He sent them out, on their own, while he took the short cut home on foot.

I am not making this up. Honest.
 
 
@Ragman,

I've been squeaming about not having the brains to start a thread for you, kid.
(Roberta calls me kid and I'm crustily older than she is)

I still will, if you would like one about the whole thing of turning sixty, starting with you. A bunch of us have, er, turned, and it is both an unimportant number and one with a lot of rumbles and reverberations.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Well, hey, I like that.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Yep. Another version of the snipe hunt. I have a story of a streaking incident when I was at K-State in which a Fort Riley soldier was somehow coerced into leaving his clothing outside my apartment while he streaked across campus, where some other vet students were to meet him and return him to his point of origin. Right. To the best of my knowledge, he may still be chasing the MTA 'neath the streets of Boston.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Sure thing. It might be fun to hear about other's experiences and share.
 
 
@Ragman,

Ok, I'll do it.

Domani.

Nag me if I forget.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Week 3

Sunday, early games

KC (KC at home in an upset over Niners who fall behind early and can't generate points easily. More than in other stadiums, Arrowhead crowds deafen their opponents.)

NO (Saints force turnovers
TN (Odds say that Giants win at home...but Titans D rules.)
Pitt @ TB (Pitt's D...end of story)
Cin (Both teams bore the crowd and one another to sleep.)
Balt (Ravens by a FG...maybe w/ final score of 3-0)
Dal (Boys... oh cripes, but do I want to pick Houston, but let's get real as Boys have too much talent. Run it, Tony, Run it!)

Sunday late games
Wash
Phil Iggles (Vick silences doubt if his team protects enough and he lives long enough to see the end of the game).
Indy (Peyton Manning takes charge)
AZ
SD (SD hands down)

Sunday, evening game

@Miz Cowdoc,

you guys are overdoing it on the dolphins this week.

starting to make me nervous, you are...

we need some adversity to overcome to be successful.
 
 
@Miz Cowdoc,

You skipped the SF vs KC game, young lady. Thanks.
 
 
@Region Philbis,

Funny list writing, Region..
 
 
@JPB,

I did pick Denver for a few days on my list-in-preparation, then backed off.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

San Fran please ( but I am pulling for KC)
 
 
AndyClubber suggested recently that, as we get into this, we would likely coalesce in our picks. I disagreed, but it appears as though, at least in Week #3, he may be right. Details tomorrow, as we wait for the expert picks from George, Spendius and Liontamerx.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I've long been amazed how we rarely pick the same exact teams..

Hey, good news! UCLA beat Texas today... (I rarely follow UCLA anymore, but I've remnants of interest if I see news about it).

Happy Sunday from Virginia where maybe, just maybe, we might get some much needed rain.
We have 22 players in thus far, missing just Liontamerx and George. The latter had a fantastic day yesterday, we expect. His lovely daughter was married.

We are frighteningly consistent in our choices this week. We are unanimous in picking New England over Buffalo. There are 6 games where we are 20-2.
Jespah and Alex have Cleveland and also have St Louis; the Cowdocs have Dallas; Johnboy and Rhys have Jacksonville; Johnboy and JPB have Seattle and EhBeth and Alex have Denver.
In the NY Giants/Tennessee game we are split 12-10 in favor the Giants. We are 15-7 in favor of the 49ers vs KC and Miami against the NY Jets.
Spendius and Cyclo are buddies this week, agreeing not only with each other but also with the majority on all of the games. Panzade and Mysteryman are out of step on just one game each. Osso, Region, Ragman, Edgar, McGentrix, Ms Cowdoc and CoastalRat differ from the majority on 2 games.
And then there is Alex who has not had much success through Week #2. He disagrees with the majority this week on 8 of the 16 games. Johnboy, Jespah and AndyClubber are a bit behind at 5 of 16.
 
 
There is an atmosphere, not unlike that which surrounds the Superbowl, in Houston this morning. I have come close to reversing my pick of Houston several times, but will keep my original choices.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I am nervous about this one, Edgar. It would be so cool to see "America's Team" start the season at 0-3.
A Tale Of Two Cities:
There was an interview yesterday on NPR with the authors of a new book (I think it is called Those Who Hit The Hardest) about the Steelers and the Cowboys back in the 1970's.
The Steelers back then were a powerful team. They won the Superbowl several times, with a couple of those against Dallas. One of those games was described as the best game ever in Superbowl history.
The back story involves the cities - Pittsburgh and Dallas. The former, of course, was a gritty city where the production of steel ruled the economy and contaminated the air. At the same time, the Cowboys played their games in south Dallas and drew their support from the equally blue collar roustabouts who worked in the oil industry.
The steel industry died in Pittsburgh but the team has never forgotten its roots.
They don't have cheerleaders at all in contrast to the Cowboys with their scantily clad large breasted young women. They don't outfit their players in shiny pants. They don't tolerate players who are thugs, although they seem to have made an exception this year with their QB.
The Cowboys abandoned south Dallas for a new stadium in north Dallas and now to a brand new stadium that is not even in Dallas. They turned their backs on the average Joe in favor of the elite.
(Stop it, Johnboy. You are starting to foam at the mouth.)
I hope the Texans crush the Cowboys today.
Keep us informed, Edgar, as this early game today unfolds in your city.
 
 
As a side note: The Steelers are the whole reason I became a football fan, in either 1963 or 64. I won a bet for five bucks that the Steelers would win the week's game. The money felt so good, I had to see these boys in action. So I began following them. I thought I had never seen anything so beautiful, the way they just demolished other teams. They are still my sentimental favorites.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

That's the way I feel about the Raiders of old, edgar. Those bad boys under Madden were something to watch.
 
 
@JPB,

I remember. In particular, the Raiders just could not lose a Monday night game.
 
 
The game is off badly for both teams. The Cowboys tried for first on fourth twice in a possession and got it once. The Cowboys sacked Shaub in The Texans first possession and they had to punt. I have worried about the Cowboys pass rush, because the Texans are missing a key defense.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

arrgh.
 
 
Yep. Cowboys with a good drive, through the air, then a rushing touchdown.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Ahem...

@LionTamerX,

My apologies. I missed most of that page while talking about cow tipping.
LionTamerx disagrees with the majority only by choosing the Jets and the Bears.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

We've got the Falcons/Saints. That 10 minute drive was pretty good.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
We are 15-7 in favor of the 49ers vs KC
 

What's the matter with the 49ers?!?!?!
