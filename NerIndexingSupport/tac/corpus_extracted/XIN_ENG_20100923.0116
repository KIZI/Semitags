The Indian capital has registered more than 2,500 cases of dengue since the
raining season started in August this year, in which experts call a "cycle of
dengue", reported the Indo-Asian News Service on Thursday.

The report quoted the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) as saying five people
have died of dengue so far, while the total number of patients of the mosquito-
spread epidemic reached 2,536 by Wednesday.

The number this year is expected to cross the 2006 figure of 3, 366 cases, said
the report.

Nearly 70 new dengue cases are turning up in the city every day. The numbers
reported by private hospitals and laboratories continue to be much higher than
the figures quoted by the MCD, said the report.
