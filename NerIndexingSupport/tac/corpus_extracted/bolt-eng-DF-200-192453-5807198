Now, let me me make it clear to you that I am definately NOT a racist. I don't judge people by their race, only by actions of individuals. ANY racist hate-filled comment on this thread WILL MORE THAN DEFINATELY be deleted. I'm aware that this is a taboo subject to talk about, so if you're black, please don't get offended. I didn't make this thread in an attempt to offend people, and spread hate.I know crime happens amongst all races, and I made this thread to find out why it's bigger in the black community. I also have quite a few black friends who are also concerned about this issue, so that's another reason not to take offence.

I live in south London, and I just read an article about Black people and crime on MailOnline, and that the figures released by the met police show that black men commit most of the crime in London.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...--victims.html 

My own experiences

I've never actually been successfully robbed, but pretty much all of the people who attemped to rob me (at school) happened to be black. Everytime somebody was aggressive towards me during school they almost always hapened to be black.

There was one black person in my class who didn't bring any equipment with him, so he asked me if i could lend him some equipment. I knew he had a reputation for 'borrowing' equipment and then not returning it back. Initially I said "no", because I was worried he won't return it back. Then he came up to me in an aggressive stance, and threatened to punch me and then take my compass...so I just had no choice but to give it to him. At the end of the lesson I asked for it back, he didn't give it straight away, and he put my compass in his bottom and rubbed it...then put it it in my hands?? Seriously??

I remember standing in the line while waiting for lunch at lunchtime at school, and this group of black students just barged in front of me. When I politely told them that I was there first, one of the black students gave me an EXTREMELY hard punch, and left my arm stinging for a while... There are endless cases which I can talk about, but I'd be here all day.

My mother has only been robbed twice, and on both occassions it involved black youths. When my mother first came into this country from South-Asia about 21 years ago, a group of black youths in Streatham approached her while she was in my Father's car. They asked her if she had any tissue, so she gave them some tissue, and then one of them grabbed her gold necklace and ran off with it. 3 years ago my Mother was at a checkpoint about to withdraw some cash, and a black youth behind her must have been looking at her pin, and she wasn't aware than the youth was behind her as half her attention was on my baby sister. Then more black youths came and told her to hurry up, and kept her distracted while another one took my Mum's credit card and ran off with it, and they knew my Mum's pin and took about Â£200. And yes, my mum did report this to the police, but they never managed to trace the boys down.

This experience is by far the most shocking experience I've had. In 2007 when I was in year 8, I was walking with two friends down tooting in South London, and a group of black teenagers approached us. They didn't go for me, but the went for my other friend. They asked him for a pound or they would take his phone. He didn't have a pound, but he begged and pleaded with them not to take his phone. After a bit of a struggle while they grabbed him, one of the black teenagers flicked hot ash from his cigarrete he was smoking into his eyes, then ran off with his school tie and phone. The police picked up the boy who was robbed and drove around in tooting to look for the boys who robbed him, but never found them.

My question is, why is crime in the black community significantly higher than other communities? And (from my experience), why some black people are a bit more aggressive than the aggressive people in other races?
 
 
was your posting interrupted by dangerous black youths?
 
 
Hmmm...

It is a simple case of falsely declaring correlation equals causation. Poverty and general socioeconomic circumstances are demonstrably the causal elements to an individual's propensity to commit crime. Incidentally, a large proportion of the African-Caribbean population is poor in the UK, which creates an apparent link between the two.

Simply being of African descent does not make somebody more predisposed to commit a crime, but their circumstances, irrespective of ethnicity, do.

Actually, the OP didn't suppose anything. The OP asked why almost all of the times he has been the victim of crimes, or people whom he knows have been the victims of crimes, the crimes have been perpetrated by black people - a perfectly valid question.
 
 
To answer that you need to look at why there is inner-city deprevation. After all, crime is an economic issue, not a racial one.
 
 
Oh no......Let me keep schtm.

Poverty does not cause crime. That is a very poor excuse thought up by the left. Bad morals is what causes crime and 99% of criminals grew up in awful households where they were raised poorly.

To make the excuse that poverty causes crime is shameful.  
 
 
Socioeconomic factor rather than the race factor. The real question is why are so many black people at the bottom socioeconomically?

Your unfavourable experiences are due to the socioeconomic circumstances of the individuals involved; their ethnicity isn't really pertinent to their individual propensities to accost you or commit a criminal offence.

It was implicit when questioning why 'black people' were more aggressive in his experience.

Hit the nail on the head.

You post the same answer on all threads of this nature. Do you have it drafted or do you actually type out the same sh*te all the time?
 
 
Sorry,I couldn't resist...But you do know that Violent crime only makes up a small minority of all crime in Britain. Less than 10% in fact. 'White crime' is extremely well hidden....try to google 'crime commited by black people' then the same for white people. Most crimes commited by white people are 'white collar crimes' i.e crimes committed within a company so are well covered.

Since you're using personal experiences,maybe I should add I have beaten up/rushed/jumped (Uprovoked attacks) by groups of white guys at least six times,and one group of Asians. As a 6ft2 black guy who looks kind of initimidating,they probably thought they would attempt to make themselves feel big.

But I ended up posting anyway :P

Thats my question too.
Its perfectly obvious that people on the lower socio-economic standings are more probable to comit crime. I can understand that.

But why is there such a high percentage of black (in comparison to total population of black people) people in that socio-economic standing?
That I cant understand as clearly.

Indeed - it doesn't explain anything to just say "oh, they're poor!"

Plus, to conclude that would need an examination of criminality between races corrected for wealth and social standing, which I'm sure would never be tolerated today.

Lets take up an example, if two people with similar bad morals grew up on the extreme ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, which one would be more likely to steal from a grocery store (for example)?

Bad morals are a factor and there are loads of black people and/or people from the lower ends of the above mentioned spectrum who do not fall foul of the law. Similarly, there are many richer and more affluent folk who commit other types of crimes.

Poverty can lead to certain types of crime that would not have been committed if the offender had more money, this is not to say that making an offender richer would stop him committing all crimes.

Poverty and general socioeconomic circumstances contribute towards crime. As the parents must focus on financial issues, the child may not receive all the attention it requires, so they defect to people who may play a role as a parental figure. The parent may be working late, be a single parent, etc., so the child has nobody they respect to guide them in the right direction. The parent may become stressed from being overworked or their child's criminality, which creates a downward spiral of family relations and worsens the existing problems.

Poverty creates problems at home. Of course, this is not the case for everyone who was raised in poverty, but to dismiss it entirely is ridiculous.

Well is it actually wrong? Given that threads of this nature are pretty much identical down to the 'I'm not a rascist disclaimer at the beginning' you might as well copy and paste.

The second part is obviously true. But there is plainly something more going on than only the associative relation you suggest.

A part of it is a "give a dog a bad name" circumstance. If society expects (specifically) young black men to be violent, it to some extent encourages them to be: they are then only living down to societal expectations.

Another possible factor, with specific relation to youth violence, is that black people typically enter puberty earlier than people from other racial groups. The ordinary 12 or 13 year old black lad is suddenly bigger and stronger than many of the other boys in his class. And this is plainly less often true of, for example, Bangladeshi kids, a group which has it worse in socioeconomic terms. Within his age-bracket, the sixteen year old black lad has often had 3 or 4 years of being able to get what he wants by main force, if inclined to.

Last, there are problems in that community, to the limited extent that it even is a community. Instead of listening to excuse-making white sociologists, listen to Bill Cosby, Chris Rock, or Chuck D. Rationalising the issue away is ultimately unhelpful. Time to look at absent fathers and a media which glamourises violence.

Exactly this. This is a huge issue and I'm sure someone out there has completed a dissertation on this issue, it is that complicated.

I think we need to differentiate between what type of "Black people" as well. There is a huge difference in how black people from the Carribeans, West Africa and East Africa live within the UK. Considering "Black people" as one huge homogeneous race is part of the problem.

That would be very interesting to see but like you, I certainly don't think it will happen.

Probably true, there's never enough shunning when you really need it.

Your making excuses again. If the parents have no time for their kids then why did they have a child in the first place? This goes back to my original point, lack of education and morals cause crime. There is nothing stopping these parents teaching their children what's right and wrong, irrespective of the 'maybe' scenarios you put forward.

Parents becoming stressed is an excuse for their child s criminality? Thats laughable sir.

It is not simply a matter of somebody's circumstances when having a child being continuous throughout their lives. Anything could happen (divorce, separation, unemployment, remortgage, etc.) that could drive a previously stable family into poverty.

 
There is nothing stopping these parents teaching their children what's right and wrong, irrespective of the 'maybe' scenarios you put forward.
 

Anyone can teach, but not everyone can enforce. This is due to the previously stated reasons.

The parents no longer have the capacity to care for the child properly and an abusive or neglectful scenario may arise. The child may even compromise the relationship with/between their parents, which compounds the problem. If a child is involved in criminal behaviour, the parents may abandon all hope and just wish for the problem to go away on its own, so they don't get caught up in it themselves.
 
 
 
If it such a poor argument, feel free to refute it.

 

You blame poor "socio-economic circumstances" as being a leading cause of crime, whilst refusing to believe that someone could be inherently predisposed to commit crime. Why is it that one theory can be accepted without any protests or qualms but another rejected? Is there actually scientific evidence to disprove that certain people are statistically more inclined to carry out crime? If not, then why does crime occur across all class boundaries? Surely those upper-class members of society shouldn't be committing crime if they're so well off.

I know you'll point to anomalies and the like, however the fact remains that you can't prove what you've actually said without applying the theory that some people are more prone to perpetuate crime. If you still dismiss what I've said then explain why some of the poorest members of society don't carry out crime, but some of the richest do?
 
 
 
If black people really do commit more crimes it could be because:

Because where naturally bad.
Because our stereotype says we are like that, so were think yeah lets be bad.
Because we think where at a major disadvantage because where black so where like why not.
Because we tend to live in poorer areas.
Because we tend to live in rougher areas.

Not saying that those points are right just throwing them out there, and even if they are its no excuse to commit crimes.

But TBH i dont think black people are more likely to commit crimes than white people and i dont think were more aggresive either...

 

Your post is literally killing me from the inside.

But honestly op you know the reasons, poverty stems hatred, hatred stems violence.

Please speak for yourself.
 
 
Maybe because bad areas have the highest crime rates, and there are a lot of black people in bad areas. Conversely, black people in middle class areas are greatly under-represented in crime statistics. I'd definitely put it down to environment. It's worth noting that the same goes for other races.

Give bad areas better post-education opportunities and better education, and I'm sure crime rates there would eventually drop.

Present evidence that on the virtue of being from a different ethnic background, one is independently predisposed to commit a crime. I would suggest an individual's propensity to commit crime is entirely contingent on their individual choice ; however, their environment and socioeconomic circumstances may pressure them into committing crime. Hence, they are causal to an individual's propensity to commit crime. As those in poverty have a considerably larger amount of unfavourable socioeconomic circumstances than wealthier individuals, the pressure to commit crime is increased substantially. However, pressure manifests itself in different ways, and simply having favourable economic circumstances does not necessarily mean social circumstances are equally favourable for the individual in question.

At no point did I suggest the propensity to commit crime is a dichotomy predicated on class; please do not create strawman arguments. Just like not all poor people commit crime, not all rich people are law-abiding. The proponent is responsible for presenting subtantiating evidence for their claim. It is not a matter of 'disproving', you are required to prove it is an inherent disposition if you believe such a thing.
 
 
 
I think these threads should be shunned.

 

What makes you say that?
 
 
 
It was implicit when questioning why 'black people' were more aggressive in his experience.

 

No it wasn't. The OP finds that a lot of crime is committed by people. The OP finds that a disproportionate number of these people are black. It is only natural to then follow this with the question, "why?" The OP did not suppose anything, nor did he make anything implicit. You simply wanted him to do so, so that you could play the race card.

You've just contradicted yourself. In your initial post you said: 'Poverty and general socioeconomic circumstances are demonstrably the causal elements to an individual's propensity to commit crime.' How does this not insinuate that the propensity to commit crime is based on class difference? To say with one breath that crime is a by-product of poverty can't coexist with then saying everyone has the tendency to perpetuate crime. It's no longer attributable to socio-economic conditions if everyone has the capability of carrying out crime. See how that works?

Furthermore you are now advocating that it's 'entirely' based upon their own moral code and decision making, only altering slightly based on the differing socio-economic conditions. So why for black people is it based on poverty, but for upper-class criminals it's because they're not law-abiding?

Disclaimer: I'm not saying that black people are innately predisposed to commit crime.
 
 
They form gangs and kill each other.. whats it got to do with asian/white people..

It quite clearly links crime with ethnicity, so I fail to see your aversion to my retort. I suggested their ethnicity is irrelevant to committing a crime and is incidental.

Invariably threads of this nature and origin only spin out of control, with half the people arguing that you're a racist and the other half trying to rationalise crime committed by certain ethnic groups, because they want to appear as PC as they can.
 
 
As much as you may be drawing conclusions from what you've read and your own experience, I think you're just being caught up in the stereotypes and misconceptions that surround crime in areas such as the ones you describe. I agree with 'whyumadtho', I think that it has everything to do with the other factors surrounding their circumstances, irrespective of race or colour. I can't help but also say that The Mail Online is not a very good source of reading either, it tends to lean towards the right and gives anything related to lower or working classes a bad light. I do not think you are being racist though, but I think that maybe the stereotypes you are being led to believe are, and realising this may help you out.
 
 
Corruption by the African government so the cycle never ends the Black people can't get out of their socioeconomic sector and it repeats again and again until government intervention or other factors.
It has already started more and more black people are going to university and getting higher rated jobs likes management, organizers. But they're still a long way off competing with any of the established developed countries.

'Propensity' does not imply a dichotomy. It is a general continuum that means those in unfavourable socioeconomic circumstances are more likely to commit crime than those in slightly better socioeconomic circumstances, who are more likely to commit crime in slightly better socioeconomic circumstances, etc. because the range of unfavourable pressures is greater in each iteration. The actual choice to commit a crime is entirely up to the individual, it is just the pressures surrounding them make it more likely.

At no point did I suggest socioeconomic circumstances are causal to committing a crime, I said they were causal to the propensity to commit a crime. You are confusing terminology and creating a strawman argument from it. It is not an absolute of 'poor=crime; rich=law-abiding', and at no point did I suggest otherwise.

 
Furthermore you are now advocating that it's 'entirely' based upon their own moral code and decision making, only altering slightly based on the differing socio-economic conditions.
 

Yes, at a basic level, everyone chooses to either commit a crime or not commit a crime. Their circumstances, however, may pressure them into criminality. I never said it 'altered slightly' an individual's propensity. It plays a considerable role in an individual's propensity to commit a crime, but ultimately, they choose to go through with it, irrespective of their circumstances. This is why not all people in unfavourable socioeconomic conditions commit crime.

 
So why for black people is it based on poverty, but for upper-class criminals it's because they're not law-abiding?
 

They are both breaking the law, but one is surrounded by socioeconomic pressures that increase their propensity to fall into criminality, whilst the other doesn't. The wealthy individual has less need to commit a crime and is not exposed to inimical social environments, whereas an individual in poverty is generally the reverse of these factors.

Propensity - An often intense natural inclination or preference.

It's not me who is confusing terminology here. Turns out you were just furthering the theory that people are born with an innate disposition to commit crime.

Quite.

I never took it as meaning innate, I was using it in the context of a tendency or likelihood of doing something. It appears there has been a misunderstanding of our interpretations of the term - not all definitions suggest 'propensity' must mean ' inherent tendency'.
 
 
Black people tend to live in poorer areas, and it's more tempting to commit crimes if you live in a poorer area.
 
 
 
Thats my question too.
Its perfectly obvious that people on the lower socio-economic standings are more probable to comit crime. I can understand that.

But why is there such a high percentage of black (in comparison to total population of black people) people in that socio-economic standing?
That I cant understand as clearly.

 

There seems to be a cycle in place, where if you have had a difficult upbringing you are far less likely to be in a position to provide everything that your own child needs, to know what is morally right and wrong.

This is why you often get generations of families living in council estates, because what children experience when they are growing up becomes normalised.

For example if your parents smoke there is a far greater chance that you will smoke. If your parent is a violent alcoholic...your more likely to be, if your parent lives off of the state... your more likely to as well.
 
 
I'm black so I'll answer in an intelligent way. Poverty, a feeling of exclusion from mainstream society and other social factors would contribute to that. The second point is particularly interesting. A lot of black youth feel like they're not part of British society and therefore may try to do everything to not be part of it. Some may feel that it is 'acting white' to try to get an education because everyone stereotypes black people as being stupid even we clearly aren't (as a race, not as individuals). For example, if there is a black man robbing banks with a couple of other black people, then a black youth (not ALL but some) may feel a sense of belonging by being part of a gang. No one can lie that this might just feel better than being in a society that tries to constantly put you down and doesn't expect much from you. Now, this can spur people on to move in two directions- gangs or getting a good education. This is why you will see that in a lot of London Boroughs like Lambeth, children of an African background are the highest achievers. In my own experience, I wouldn't want to go to somewhere like Oxford Uni because I fear that people will be prejudiced towards me. I understand that might be an irrational fear but unfortunately I don't trust this society to treat me as a member of it. Although, I am British with no exceptions, I don't believe that other British people are that accepting of me. I said 'accepting' not 'tolerant'. The difference is stark. But yhhh those are the issues.
 
 
 
I'm black so I'll answer in an intelligent way. Poverty, a feeling of exclusion from mainstream society and other social factors would contribute to that. The second point is particularly interesting. A lot of black youth feel like they're not part of British society and therefore may try to do everything to not be part of it. Some may feel that it is 'acting white' to try to get an education because everyone stereotypes black people as being stupid even we clearly aren't (as a race, not as individuals). For example, if there is a black man robbing banks with a couple of other black people, then a black youth (not ALL but some) may feel a sense of belonging by being part of a gang. No one can lie that this might just feel better than being in a society that tries to constantly put you down and doesn't expect much from you. Now, this can spur people on to move in two directions- gangs or getting a good education. This is why you will see that in a lot of London Boroughs like Lambeth, children of an African background are the highest achievers.

This is one of the best answers i've got for my thread, and yes - Black people are as smart as any other race. In my school there are indeed very calm and very intelligent black people achieving As and A*s in a few subjects. Maybe black people need better role models than gangster rappers.

Of course there are better role models, but obviously it's what is most portrayed in the media. Most of these gangster rappers come from America anyway, and no offense to them but I don't think Britain should follow any pop culture that comes from America. However, with that being said, it is important to note that there are vast amounts of black people (like you mentioned) who take the lack of expectation and try to prove society wrong. Furthermore, I think it is important to note that black men are 7 times more likely to get stopped than their white counterparts. I doubt that this has much to do with the general public's perception of crime, but more to do with institutional racism within the police force. For this reason, although crime is probably higher among black people (have I worded that correctly? You know what I mean!) figures may be exaggerated because less people of other races are caught doing crime whilst more black people are (because black males get stopped all the time whilst other people don't). Anyway, here's another essay for you to read! (I'm so sorry that this is so long). And thanks! You think it's one of the best responses! YAY!  
 
 
its because of the "badman" culture
 
 
Eugh, don't give me that poverty rubbish!

In Britain there is virtually no such thing as 'poverty' if you are a citizen. There is no excuse for crime here. Maybe that excuse holds water in countries that don't have the cushy social benifits system we do, maybe in Etheopia, Ukraine or Bolivia, but here? Well it's rubbish. What causes the crime is scummy people. Scummy parents, scummy peers, or just a scummy person. Crime in this sense anyway.

Socially, as you said, there is poverty in terms of the person's environment and peers, who may be inimical to their development. This translates into relative economic poverty, as the poorest areas attract the most socially unfavourable people, which results in a decline of prospects and ambitions of the individuals in question. If the area is dismal the person's attitude to the area will be equally dismal. The 'broken window theory' illustrates this phenomenon - when there are gangs around, people fall into gangs; when there is grafitti, people spray more grafitti, etc.

Ethnicity is pertinent though isnt it. Because differant ethnicities have differant cultural attributes.

Poverty can only be blamed for so much. Please explain why almost all gang rapes in the UK are comitted by black ?

Poverty cannot be blamed for raping people, so please explain why almost all gang rapists are black ?

It is because ethncities have unique cultural attributes, so you are wrong when you say ethnciity is nor relevent, It obviously is

Would it not then be the culture that is responsible for the crime, as opposed to the ethnic origins of the individual in question?

The prevalence of gangs is most certainly caused by socioeconomic poverty, which translates into crime. Poverty and culture (which is not exclusive to those of African descent, but is more a spatially influenced variable) perpetuates these problems.

Ethnicity encompasses culture. As I said before differant ethncities have differant cultural attributes and the origin of that ethnicity is pertinent as the culture in the region will be relevent to the cultural attributes of any person from that ethnicity who lives abroad, whether or not they are born and raised in the UK or otherwise.

Hence why ethnicity is pertinent. Culture is a very strong componant in someones ethnicity.

As I said before, poverty does not cause people to rape. Yet almost all gang rapists are black.

P.S I have read many of your posts and you are very anally retentive. Just drop the over the top lingo such as "spatially influenced variable" and stop making yourself look like a complete knob, when using language like this. We all know how smart you are, so do us all a favour and just cut it out.

Youseem to be forgetting free will. You can talk of broken window theory as regards social cohesion, local culture and so on. But when it comes to criminality, that is where the line is drawn. Breaking the law because the people around you do is no excuse. If that was all they ever knew, if they never knew about law and order, then maybe they'd have an excuse. But we have school, television, radio, film etc that are all influences on people. There is no excuse for crime. If I lived in an area full of scum then I would want to rise above it, not sink into it.

The variable is not ethnicity, but culture. Irrespective of a person's ethnic origins, if they do not follow the socially inimical culture that causes crime, they are not unfavourable to society. Some, but not all African-Caribbean people follow criminal culture. It is demonstrably the culture, which is not exclusive to an individual of a particular ethnic origin, that is responsible for the perpetuation of crime. Poverty encases the most unfavourable elements of culture and makes increases the chance of people living in the spatial area of poverty adopting that unfavourable culture.

I agree that ultimately it is the individual's choice that causes them to commit a crime; however, their socioeconomic circumstances may apply immense pressure that increases the likelihood of them committing the crime. These pressures are not very easily overcome, which is why there is a perpetuation of socioeconomic poverty. It is also influenced by the situation at the child's home, and whether there is enough parental guidance, money for equipment, etc.

The culture is unfavourable, not the ethnicity. Irrespecitve of whether it's the Queen or an ethnically British, poor social delinquent, they will still both be 'White British' in their ethnicity, despite following opposing cultures.

I would put it down to culture and the prevalence of gangs in poor areas.

Scotland has deeply ingrained gang problems and far poorer areas than London. There are far more whites in poverty in Scotland than Blacks in poverty in England

Yet gang rape is unheard of in Scotland.

So you are wrong.

I ask you again, why are almost all gang rapists black ?

True say, my Mum wanted me to go to Oxford..and I thought..no way, they'll just be prejudice towards me, and the thing is that they would.
Took me a while to accept that fact.
I can imagine that other black people wouldnt accept it..this is a huge problem.

Blame rests with the person, then the parents, then the peers, then the situation. In that order, in my opinion. Perhaps you can say the conditions may lead to violent behaviour, or gang related offences, maybe drugs. But theft? Random assault? There is no reason for that. There is no need to steal, there is no need to be violent, and noone can get to 18 without knowing those things are fundamentally wrong and against the law.

I give the people that commit those crimes no excuses.

100% agree with you.

And relative poverty in Britain is not an excuse to commit crime.

If you live in a country where you sleep on a mud floor and eat 1 slice of bread a day, then yes, theft, gang behavior and other such crimes are perhaps, acceptable and understandable. Here in Britain where noone is without a roof over their head or food on their plate so long as they are a citizen, there is no excuse for robbing someone of their iPod, or engaging in other nefarious activity. Just because you don't have a nice pair of trainers or a shiny new iPod doesn't mean you can go and steal one, even if you are relativley poor.
 
 
 
Wheres the stats?

 

There are many many articles on the subject

 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk...e-1711381.html 

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V8pqheM82Q 

If you want more just ask. Unfortunatley the police do not release stats in connection with race and ethnicity due to political correctness and all that. However, it is well noted that almost all gang rapists are black.
 
 
I've not read the whole thread and this has probably been mentioned, but I'd say it's to do with the fact that ethnic minorities in the UK generally live in poorer conditions than white people. Generally speaking, the most deprived areas in the UK eg. areas of London, Birmingham, Manchester etc. all have high proportions of ethnic minorities, which is likely caused by the fact that when these people first migrated to the UK they tended to congregate in poor inner city areas where housing is cheap. Poverty leads to crime, and growing up with a lot of crime leads to people subsequently turning to crime in the view that it is OK, joining gangs etc., it's a vicious cycle. Gangs in London are a huge problem, and many of them tend to only invite black people to join.

The point I'm trying to make is that from what I know, the correlation between black people and crime (which isn't a racist statement, but derived from facts and statistics), has absolutely nothing to do with skin colour, and everything to do with social welfare. I know middle class black kids who are in no way violent, and I know lower class white kids exactly like the ones you've described in the OP (just for the record I am in no way suggesting social class determines the characteristic of a person, but you cannot ignore the relationship).

Unfortunately, rationality is not a common attribute of those involved in criminal behaviour. Irrespective of legality, territorial/social disputes are often violent and distinct from typical oral negotiation that would be done with rational-minded people.

Not only in areas of poverty, but any 'organised' criminal groups seek to maximise their private benefits whilst completely overlooking the social costs.

Culture manifests itself with poverty in different ways. Different areas have different problems caused by the combination of gangs, culture and poverty.
 
 
 
Now, let me me make it clear to you that I am definately NOT a racist. I don't judge people by their race, only by actions of individuals. ANY racist hate-filled comment on this thread WILL MORE THAN DEFINATELY be deleted. I'm aware that this is a taboo subject to talk about, so if you're black, please don't get offended. I didn't make this thread in an attempt to offend people, and spread hate.I know crime happens amongst all races, and I made this thread to find out why it's bigger in the black community. I also have quite a few black friends who are also concerned about this issue, so that's another reason not to take offence.

I live in south London, and I just read an article about Black people and crime on MailOnline, and that the figures released by the met police show that black men commit most of the crime in London.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...--victims.html 

My own experiences

I've never actually been successfully robbed, but pretty much all of the people who attemped to rob me (at school) happened to be black. Everytime somebody was aggressive towards me during school they almost always hapened to be black.

There was one black person in my class who didn't bring any equipment with him, so he asked me if i could lend him some equipment. I knew he had a reputation for 'borrowing' equipment and then not returning it back. Initially I said "no", because I was worried he won't return it back. Then he came up to me in an aggressive stance, and threatened to punch me and then take my compass...so I just had no choice but to give it to him. At the end of the lesson I asked for it back, he didn't give it straight away, and he put my compass in his bottom and rubbed it...then put it it in my hands?? Seriously??

I remember standing in the line while waiting for lunch at lunchtime at school, and this group of black students just barged in front of me. When I politely told them that I was there first, one of the black students gave me an EXTREMELY hard punch, and left my arm stinging for a while... There are endless cases which I can talk about, but I'd be here all day.

My mother has only been robbed twice, and on both occassions it involved black youths. When my mother first came into this country from South-Asia about 21 years ago, a group of black youths in Streatham approached her while she was in my Father's car. They asked her if she had any tissue, so she gave them some tissue, and then one of them grabbed her gold necklace and ran off with it. 3 years ago my Mother was at a checkpoint about to withdraw some cash, and a black youth behind her must have been looking at her pin, and she wasn't aware than the youth was behind her as half her attention was on my baby sister. Then more black youths came and told her to hurry up, and kept her distracted while another one took my Mum's credit card and ran off with it, and they knew my Mum's pin and took about Â£200. And yes, my mum did report this to the police, but they never managed to trace the boys down.

This experience is by far the most shocking experience I've had. In 2007 when I was in year 8, I was walking with two friends down tooting in South London, and a group of black teenagers approached us. They didn't go for me, but the went for my other friend. They asked him for a pound or they would take his phone. He didn't have a pound, but he begged and pleaded with them not to take his phone. After a bit of a struggle while they grabbed him, one of the black teenagers flicked hot ash from his cigarrete he was smoking into his eyes, then ran off with his school tie and phone. The police picked up the boy who was robbed and drived around to look for the boys who robbed him, but never found them.

My question is, why is crime in the black community significantly higher than other communities? And (from my experience), why some black people are a bit more aggressive than the aggressive people in other races?

 

aw that's so mean

That is not a satisfactory answer ? Why does pvoerty manifest itself in the form of black people gang raping girls ?

Why has this manifested itself in only black people, even when those blacks live and were brought up in different cities ?

The fact is that you cannot explain it.

Even a child can understand what is allowed and what is not allowed. Action and Consequence. There is no defence from poverty for their crimes.

When there is little consequence above what they consider to be beneficial (a product of defeatism caused by poverty and dismal prospects), they commit actions without fear of repercussions. Some may feel there is nothing worse than what they are going through and resort to crime as a falsely perceived 'only way out'.

Then they are ignorant ingrates and deserve to feel the full wieght of the law. Poverty isn't an excuse. Parents and peers can motivate, anyone with half a brain cell can achieve in our society. Poverty may be a small contributing factor, but it is in no way an excuse.

I wouldn't say it is a small contributing factor at all. I believe socioeconomic poverty, not as a general variable, but accounting for individual circumstances, may have an immense influence on a child's prospects and social outlook

For whatever reason, the prospect of gangs and general recalcitrance is seen as more socioeconomically favourable to some people than others at the point of committing the crime.
 
 
i guess its just the area you live,
what made me laugh was how a guy threatened to punch you in order to ''borrow'' your compass    
 
 
 
Socioeconomic factor rather than the race factor. The real question is why are so many black people at the bottom socioeconomically?

 

survival of the fittest? Darwin?
 
 
correlation = cause flaw.

just because there is correlation it doesn't mean that they commit crimes because they are black.

Wrongly seen as favourable. There is all the education in the world available. Relative poverty may be a cause, although I put it more down to awful parenting and peer influence. But it is not an excuse.

Poverty does not cause people to rape. Otherwise whites would be gang raping more than blacks because there are many more white people living in poverty than black people.

However this is not the case.

Yes I am aware of this. The fact that almost all gang rapists are black are not caused by race but cultural/ethnic attributes.

That has already been established

Its has nothing to do with poverty or incidences of crime in differant areas.

Whch is their own choice, an as such no amount of British poverty should be their defense. It boils down to the 'oh but everyone does it around me' argument, which I think we can all agree is not justification or proper excuse.

The influence of poverty should not be completely overlooked on the basis of a person's decision to commit a crime. Environmental factors have a large impact on a child's development and social outlook, which means children raised in an unstable environment are likely to have a less distinct dichotomy of right and wrong than somebody raised in a stable environment. Yes, it is still down to their choice, but I wouldn't suggest external influences are completely overlooked (not necessarily in a legal context, but in this discussion).

Well I believe responsibility rests with the person, not their enviroment. All the poverty in Britain does not stop you knwoing right from wrong. There is no amount of poverty a British citizen in Britain can be in to require them to turn to crime, and certainly not the type of crime these hoodlums commit. I see it as no excuse.

There is no amount of poverty a British citizen in Britain can be in to require them to turn to crime, and certainly not the type of crime these hoodlums commit. I see it as no excuse.

 

You presuppose right and wrong is an objective concept. Your right and wrong may not be somebody else's right and wrong. Their socioeconomic circumstances distort their morality from common conventions. It is not a requirement, but due to their moral compass being distorted by their surroundings, a socially unfavourable action is not seen as wrong to the individuals in question, as they prioritise their private benefits over the social costs.

I'm talking right and wrong not as social and moral constructs, but in terms of law. Everyone can agree that theft is wrong, murder is wrong, selling drugs is wrong. Now I may not agree with those laws on a personal level, but I am well aware that they are there, as is everyone else. As distorted as my view of morality may be, those set in stone rules are there for all to see. When people bend these rules, it is not down to warped moral views, or different social constructs it is donw to greed, lazieness, lust and a great many other unsavoury things.

I don;t see how them seeing themself as more important is any sort of defense, you can say this is brought about by their relative poverty, but it is not a phenmomena observed in all people in such a situation. It is also rather obvious where the law, and general moral consensus lies on the subjects. Anyone that claims to be ignoarnt of such facts can add liar aswell as criminal to their record.

Agreed fully. whyumadtho regularly uses academic blather gratuitously, that is completely over the top in order to try and make himself look big and smart. He chooses to speak in an overly pompous and complex way, when he could easily say what he wants in plainer english.

Your entirely correct though, what he said is irrelevent as common law crimes are the most basic morals that are indeed objective, common law crimes exist objectively in all cultures - rape, theft, fraud murder etc.

Not everyone sees the law as an arbitrator of morality; it would be illogical to do so. It may very well be down to those socially unfavourable emotions, but that prioritisation of personal morality over social morality causes the problems in question.

Some people are more susceptible to the pressures of their environment than others; not everyone in relative poverty has the socioeconomic pressures applied to them or personal factors (intelligence, attention span, parental guidance, etc.) as other poor people have.

Irrationality caused by a disregard of society (possibly because they believe society has failed them - I'm not saying this is right, for the record) means they do not take the social costs of these actions into account.

Of course not. But by being a citizen of a country, you agree to abide by it's laws, thus any breaking of them is still doing wrong, and not agreeing with them is not an excuse. This is what I mean. You can argue about the subjective morality of their peers, the social makeup and cohesion of their friends and family, but it doesn't change what is deemed right and wrong by the law. And those people know that, they choose to break the law, needlessly, and so their relative poverty is no excuse.

Arguably we are subject to these pressures. Why are only those in poverty allowed to use it as a defence?
 
 
 
And relative poverty in Britain is not an excuse to commit crime.

If you live in a country where you sleep on a mud floor and eat 1 slice of bread a day, then yes, theft, gang behavior and other such crimes are perhaps, acceptable and understandable. Here in Britain where noone is without a roof over their head or food on their plate so long as they are a citizen, there is no excuse for robbing someone of their iPod, or engaging in other nefarious activity. Just because you don't have a nice pair of trainers or a shiny new iPod doesn't mean you can go and steal one, even if you are relativley poor.

 

I know, but I was just saying that there is poverty in the UK..

And no you're wrong, there are plenty of Homeless, who are nationals, but dont have anything?..

But the different social circumstances create a situation where they disregard the law to fulfil their own needs. The pressures may dictate to them the only way to become something in society is to join a gang and earn 'respect' by committing crime and being generally intimidating. They may not feel society has anything to offer, so choose to abide by their own 'laws'. This is not exclusive to those in poverty, but for anyone whose ambitions are lacklustre. I feel poverty makes this situation more likely and stronger.

 
Arguably we are subject to these pressures. Why are only those in poverty allowed to use it as a defence?
 

The pressures endured by people in poverty are far greater and influential to their character than those endured by others. Combined with personal inadequacies amplified by the poverty, I feel this has a greater impact on their tendency to commit crime.
 
 
 
Now, let me me make it clear to you that I am definately NOT a racist. I don't judge people by their race, only by actions of individuals. ANY racist hate-filled comment on this thread WILL MORE THAN DEFINATELY be deleted. I'm aware that this is a taboo subject to talk about, so if you're black, please don't get offended. I didn't make this thread in an attempt to offend people, and spread hate.I know crime happens amongst all races, and I made this thread to find out why it's bigger in the black community. I also have quite a few black friends who are also concerned about this issue, so that's another reason not to take offence.

I live in south London, and I just read an article about Black people and crime on MailOnline, and that the figures released by the met police show that black men commit most of the crime in London.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...--victims.html 

My own experiences

I've never actually been successfully robbed, but pretty much all of the people who attemped to rob me (at school) happened to be black. Everytime somebody was aggressive towards me during school they almost always hapened to be black.

There was one black person in my class who didn't bring any equipment with him, so he asked me if i could lend him some equipment. I knew he had a reputation for 'borrowing' equipment and then not returning it back. Initially I said "no", because I was worried he won't return it back. Then he came up to me in an aggressive stance, and threatened to punch me and then take my compass...so I just had no choice but to give it to him. At the end of the lesson I asked for it back, he didn't give it straight away, and he put my compass in his bottom and rubbed it...then put it it in my hands?? Seriously??

I remember standing in the line while waiting for lunch at lunchtime at school, and this group of black students just barged in front of me. When I politely told them that I was there first, one of the black students gave me an EXTREMELY hard punch, and left my arm stinging for a while... There are endless cases which I can talk about, but I'd be here all day.

My mother has only been robbed twice, and on both occassions it involved black youths. When my mother first came into this country from South-Asia about 21 years ago, a group of black youths in Streatham approached her while she was in my Father's car. They asked her if she had any tissue, so she gave them some tissue, and then one of them grabbed her gold necklace and ran off with it. 3 years ago my Mother was at a checkpoint about to withdraw some cash, and a black youth behind her must have been looking at her pin, and she wasn't aware than the youth was behind her as half her attention was on my baby sister. Then more black youths came and told her to hurry up, and kept her distracted while another one took my Mum's credit card and ran off with it, and they knew my Mum's pin and took about Â£200. And yes, my mum did report this to the police, but they never managed to trace the boys down.

This experience is by far the most shocking experience I've had. In 2007 when I was in year 8, I was walking with two friends down tooting in South London, and a group of black teenagers approached us. They didn't go for me, but the went for my other friend. They asked him for a pound or they would take his phone. He didn't have a pound, but he begged and pleaded with them not to take his phone. After a bit of a struggle while they grabbed him, one of the black teenagers flicked hot ash from his cigarrete he was smoking into his eyes, then ran off with his school tie and phone. The police picked up the boy who was robbed and drived around to look for the boys who robbed him, but never found them.

My question is, why is crime in the black community significantly higher than other communities? And (from my experience), why some black people are a bit more aggressive than the aggressive people in other races?

 

Why do so many people say "definately" for years without realising they sound like complete idiots?

Definitely

Definitely

Definitely

Definitely

But yeah, there is definitely something up with black people and crime.
 
 
Unemployment poverty deprived. It like that in white areas too.

Fuk racists

Quite a few have actually made choices that put them there. And I don't mean that in a vauge or derogatory way. But there are always provisions for those people, and safety nets before such circumstances come to pass.

So essentially, you're argument is because they are poor they feel it's ok to commit crime? Come on, you're not even delving into any psycho analysis or anything, you're making an argument that I fundamentally disagree with. Everyone has unfavourable circumstances at some point. That doesn't change the laws, if they choose to flaut them because of how they feel, well that is no excuse at all. The only possible excuse would be if they did not know right from wrong or were forced into the action, neither of which happen. Well for the most part, I suppose you could say some are forced into some actions, but I'm not sure.

No, I'm not saying it's okay, I'm saying their environmental pressures make it more likely they make the wrong life choices. These wrong choices are born of being surrounded by a dismal socioeconomic environment that (taken from my sig   ) clouds their ambitions. Of course, it makes sense that somebody would want to ameliorate their conditions and rise out of poverty, but the role of personal attributes and social expectations, as well as poor education, home life, etc., make this far more difficult to fathom for those in poverty.

Well, I'd argue that part of those factors are made up by the relativley low intelligence of those in poverty, along with poor parenting. I'd say those factors contribute more than their economic situation.

Infact, I'd say 90% of it comes down to parenting to be honest. And after that it's a case of scum begetting scum when these people come together and create an enviroment for yet more scum to breed. The problem is the people, not their economic situation.

Not only parenting, but the general environment in which the child was raised, and the normality of unfavourable social characteristics.
 
 
Actually economic situations does play a big part seeing as people mostly commit crme in order to get somethng materially benificial out of it. if they were living standardley or in a bit of luxury i guess there would be less need to go out and steal/rob seeing as they'd be able to buy it for themselves. and theres also the other factors such as self fufilling prohpecys...
 
 
 
Not only parenting, but the general environment in which the child was raised, and the normality of unfavourable social characteristics.

 

Mainly the parenting. Parents have the duty to impart upon their child right and wrong. Noone is in such a position to chastise them and generally educate them as the parents. Any failure of a child ultimatley rests on the parents shoulders.
 
 
 
Socioeconomic factor rather than the race factor. The real question is why are so many black people at the bottom socioeconomically?

 

Any thoughts?
 
 
In an abusive relationship where the husband beats the wife there is much talk about what is wrong with the woman, but almost no talk about what is wrong with the man. His violence is blamed on her : If dinner was on time, if the house was cleaner then he would not have to hit her.

Is the woman perfect ? NO
Does she have faults ? YES

Should she do better ? Maybe

But it is also besides the point.

Even if she were perfect, her troubles would not go away. Because he would be unchanged.

The white relationship with blacks used to be nakedly abusive : It featured whips and chains and rapes and cutting off body parts and breaking up families. And later, hangings and bombings. The abusive mindset remains. All our lives the media never tires of negativity when it comes to black people. People have got so used to it that some in TSR expect me to do it too. It is not the heart of the matter and only feeds the racism.

Further, most pathologies are driven by white racism itself. But when you talk about so called "Black Crime"

What happens ?

The argument is moved from what whites do to what other people do, mainly blacks. At one level it is just a cheap attempt to change the subject, to draw attention away from what white people do. But at a deeper level it is also a moral argument â directed not at black ppl but at white people themselves. White people know they live in an unequal society where whites benefit and blacks get screwed. They feel guilt about that at some level because they believe in equality and believe that racism is wrong. Since they want to believe they are good people they either fight against that inequality â or make up excuses.

MAKING UP EXCUSES IS WAY EASIER

If they can blame blacks for what ever troubles may come our way, then they have no reason to feel guilty at all. Then they can still see themselves as good people.

CASE CLOSED

So in the end we know all about what is wrong with blacks, because that makes white people feel better about themselves, but very little is said about what is wrong with white people and the white racism built into society. Where is the BBC special on that ? Still waiting

However, parental stress and socioeconomic problems may mean they cannot enforce the values they have attempted to inculcate into their child. Relationship problems and financial stress may take the priority off the child's welfare.

Circular poverty.

Pretty much sums it up.
 
 
 
However, parental stress and socioeconomic problems may mean they cannot enforce the values they have attempted to inculcate into their child. Relationship problems and financial stress may take the priority off the child's welfare.

 

The blame still falls on the parent. Why have child if you cannot look after it properly? But equally, blame rests with the child. They know right from wrong in an objective, law based sense. Hell, most of them wouldn't even have understood what we were talking about when you talk of subjective morality being influenced by factors inside social group.

As I said before, scum begets scum, and scum tend not to prosper. Criminals are the product of scum, not their economic situation.

Circumstances at the point of conceiving the child may change thereafter for the worse (redundancy, divorce, remortgage, etc.).

Pressures may cause them to disregard law (which is made for optimum social progression) in favour of their own policies. This may be due to being at the bottom end of society creating an attitude of, 'society isn't doing anything for me, so I won't do anything for society'.

 
As I said before, scum begets scum, and scum tend not to prosper. Criminals are the product of scum, not their economic situation.
 

That is very absolute. Not all criminals come from socially unfavourable parents, and not all socially unfavourable parents create criminals. It adds an additional dimension of pressure to the child's chance of life success, though.
 
 
Three important things to understand:
Most crime is same-race: white-on-white and black-on-black. Most black people are no more dangerous than most white people. The crime rate is lower in white neighbourhoods because they receive, much better police protection than black ones It has little to do with white people being more moral or black people having some kind of criminal nature. Stories of black-on-white crime spread faster and farther because they seem more terrible. The belief that blacks commit most of the crime makes whites feel safer : They can avoid most crime by moving away from blacks. Except that it is not true : Whites commit most of the crime something that is lost sight of in all this talk about the black crime rate. So the sense of security is a false one. Further, the stereotypes make crime into a race issue, which means crime is not fought intelligently. Instead we get racial profiling and making it hard for those with a conviction to make an honest living. Which makes society more dangerous and more crime-ridden than it has to be, despite all the prisons it has built and all the black men it has locked up.

I think people need to step away from looking at the classical crimes. As some one who has studied organized crime. I can the real big organized crime is almost always white. Russian mafia gangs and the powerful vory v zakone brotherhood are almost exclusively white, though some Uzbeks and other ethnic minorities are presented among their ranks. Italian organized crime is exclusive: Neapolitan camorra. European organized crime in general is white and forms a underworld web that beats black street gangs easily in power, prestige and money. Turkish Babas and organizations are exclusive.

In France there are strong Algerian immigrant gangs and organizations but the upper echelon of French organizations are white. Very few black criminals have risen to the top there or in Britain despite numerous black criminals in those countries. Indian criminal networks and crime groups are also exclusive, meaning they do not accept blacks among the rank and file, not to mention in the leadership positions.

Now how this effects on people in the UK and their safety ?

These real organized crime groups are responsible for the flow of drugs into UK and Europe but they are white. They look respectable so you will walk past them int he street and no give them a thought. They are also serious players in the financial fraud scene. They smuggle weapons and supply the street criminals with weapons and drugs. And of course, they are the ones who operate together with corrupt officials and politicians. This has been documented for decades by now. They smuggle illegal DVDS, tobacco, are involved in the sex trade. You have to understand the economics of this real big crime : There are no funds in the black ghetto areas which could pay up the tons of drugs they import annually into UK.

It is the huge white middle and upper classes that consume casually the majority of the drugs in the UK. They have the capital for it. That is the economical fact. This is good to remember. The same goes for Europe too. Then, there are the stockbroker jugglers who are also organized criminals and who are the main reason why the average whites in the UK are in the deep ****, loose their homes, insurances. They affect to the security of the white middle brits many many times more than any black street mugger or dope smoking gang-banger.

THESE PEOPLE LAUGH AT YOU

Because they know your pointing the finger at the wrong people. Not that I say that street crime is less harmful or anything. It has to be taken seriously too, but one has to remember the causes of it.

No excuse. If you're not in at least some sembelence of stability you shouldn't have children.

And that is pure selfishness from their part, not the fault of society. A case of 'you have I want'.

We were talking about a specific type of criminal though. I'm saying that people such as you attribute their criminality to their socioeconomic situation, I attribute it to their parents and peers.
 
 
 
No excuse. If you're not in at least some sembelence of stability you shouldn't have children.

 

That's a bit unfair. People who were previously stable may have been inflicted with a series of events that have destroyed that stability. Redundancy/divorce/natural disasters (particularly fire)/sudden death or long-term illness of a breadwinner/etc. are unpredicatable events that can destroy the stability that was once there.

I agree, but their situation causes that antipathy towards society.

I amalgamate parents and peers into the social part of socioeconomic. I feel they both have strong roles in the behaviour of a child.

But most haven't had that happen. Most have just had children willy nilly.

And I'd consider them seperate. You were making a point about poverty. I was making a point about scummy people. There are scummy people with money, who have equally scummy children. But scum tends to sink to the bottom, so ends up in poverty, and the two help each other perpetuate. There is no excuse for them.

I agree in the case of parents who clearly have no interest in the child's welfare and are completely unsuitable to act as parents (teen pregnancies in particular).

That is a rarity, but I agree with the second point, which is why I assign their influence on the child as being generally equal. When both social and economic circumstances are poor, the child has the greatest environmental pressure to overcome, which means they are likely to become socially unfavourable members of society as a matter of culture.

I'd argue that their parents put them in that economic situation by being failures. But I suppose that is a little abstract when it comes to the actions of the child. As I said before, I'll concede that relative poverty may have some degree of impact, but I think far more important are the parents and the peers.

It could also be the case that the poor socioeconomic circumstances make the parents 'failures'. It has a similar, but less potent, impact on anyone who finds themselves in a socioeconomically inimical environment, including parents.

Parents that are failures, and in that enviroment shouldn't have children. A simple but elegant solution to the problem of a perpetuating cycle of the underclass.

When my mother first came into this country from South-Asia about 21 years ago, a group of black youths in Streatham approached her while she was in my Father's car. They asked her if she had any tissue, so she gave them some tissue, and then one of them grabbed her gold necklace and ran off with it. 3 years ago my Mother was at a checkpoint about to withdraw some cash, and a black youth behind her must have been looking at her pin, and she wasn't aware than the youth was behind her as half her attention was on my baby sister. Then more black youths came and told her to hurry up, and kept her distracted while another one took my Mum's credit card and ran off with it, and they knew my Mum's pin and took about Â£200. And yes, my mum did report this to the police, but they never managed to trace the boys down.

This experience is by far the most shocking experience I've had. In 2007 when I was in year 8, I was walking with two friends down tooting in South London, and a group of black teenagers approached us. They didn't go for me, but the went for my other friend. They asked him for a pound or they would take his phone. He didn't have a pound, but he begged and pleaded with them not to take his phone. After a bit of a struggle while they grabbed him, one of the black teenagers flicked hot ash from his cigarrete he was smoking into his eyes, then ran off with his school tie and phone. The police picked up the boy who was robbed and drived around to look for the boys who robbed him, but never found them.

My question is, why is crime in the black community significantly higher than other communities? And (from my experience), why some black people are a bit more aggressive than the aggressive people in other races?

 

hello and thank you for this thread sometimes i feel like the only person with an immigrant background who is concerned about such issues.

black people are the most aggressive because they have more testosterone than other races and have short term thinking.

also, do not mistake this aggressive behaviour as strength, it is weakness. animalistic.

i urge you read this book written by a chinese girl in america who is speaking out about this hidden black on asian violence.

Parents that are failures, and in that enviroment shouldn't have children. A simple but elegant solution to the problem of a perpetuating cycle of the underclass.

 

Despite the nature of that proposition being borderline eugenics, it is also unenforceable. Poor people should be allowed to have children, as the small minority of those children end up being criminals.

I fail to see the problem with eugenics.

Hmm, some poor people should. Some shouldn't.

Well, we'd start with soft eugenics. Aborting damged foetuses for one.

Then we move onto weeding out the serious criminal elements along with carriers of serious genetic disease. Criminals to stop social lineage, and disease carriers to stop genetic malformation. As we move toward an increasingly less labour intensive society we need fewer people, there is a natural decline in birth rates. However, this far more pronounced among the upper echelons of society, exactly where it shouldn't be.

All our advances have stopped any serious move toward the betterment of the species. I believe it our duty to work toward the futherment of our species, in every way. Weeding out weak genetic links is one of these. Then we look at where children would have the best life. We look at intelligence, affluence and so on. Certain restrictions should be put in place. A certain level of affluence or intelligence or excellence must be displayed by at least one partner, and a base level of intelligence by both in order to recieve any help from the state. A simple measure, but should stop the procreation of the pronounced brow masses we see on Jeremy Kyle, that are a blight on humanity. Essentially my view of eugenics would be making the population healthier, whilst controlling population growth and giving prospective children the best life possible. All goals I think we can agree on.
 
 
It is, like people have said socio economic.

Wealth is contingent on poverty, and cannot exist without it. Society would collapse without those in poverty.

It is impossible to predict a baby's future contribution to society, irrespective of their circumstances. Most poor children grow up without breaking the law.

You do realise that this is exactly what Hitler used to justify genocide?

The way you've put it the situation looks a lot more simple and utopic than it actually is because:

Speaking politically, you would have to force people to abort children who did not meet a set "social standard". Without such coercion, the genepool you're trying to create would still contain mutated alleles. That is denying people their human rights, in which reproduction is a core policy. And the cost! How would you monitor every single corner of the Earth? We can't even distribute food equally, how will we distribute technology?

Speaking scientifically, you would have to go about doing clinical trials to determine which genes can be written off, which should be kept, the right combination to make a super human, etc. All very advanced stuff, especially since it would be hard to determine the most beneficial mix. The other problem is that natural selection depends on a diverse genepool. If you have restricted the alleles in a given population, then they simply will not have the variation to adapt to a changing environment, and any Biologist will tell you that that is preliminary to extinction. Without the ability to predict the future, you cannot determine that an allele which is not useful now, will not be useful in the future. It may turn out that it's the key to our progression yet has been lost forever.

Speaking morally, you would be interfering in a natural process. Trying to jump evolution essentially. There could easily be unforeseen circumstances. In this hypothetical world, anyone who chose not to have a designer baby would be immediately at a disadvantage. It would result in even more discrimination, what employer would choose an ordinary human over a super human? The gap between rich and poor would widen. You would also be faced with the task of labelling anyone who did not fit your profile as inferior in some way. Who decides that? How can that even be determined? Are you saying someone in a wheelchair is inferior to you because you can walk? The reality is that people in wheelchairs live very fulfilling lives and often go on to be some of the most creative people. It's all a very slippery slope if you ask me.

Corruption by the African government so the cycle never ends the Black people can't get out of their socioeconomic sector and it repeats again and again until government intervention or other factors.
It has already started more and more black people are going to university and getting higher rated jobs likes management, organizers. But they're still a long way off competing with any of the established developed countries.

 

How in anyway is this relevant to the OPs question/point? He is talking about the UK and not the "African government."
 
 
 
Ahh i see, btw I never said that because of their race they're going to commit a crime

 

You seem to have forgotten where you are.

This is TSR, people here like to jump the gun. If you mention different races, there is nearly always bound to be someone who assumes that you're at the very least, implying something racist.

Children aren't always planned but aside from that; the majority of the children born with your mentioned circumstances do not grow up to commit crime. So why stop all people in this situation having children if it is only the minority that is the problem?
 
 
I do hope that by 'socio-economic circumstances' you mean less than Â£15,000 a year in all cases.

It was implicit in his initial statement (to which he has since made substantial modifications). I do not consider a simple post racist, and never do; however, I inferred from the initial statement that he felt it was 'racially' linked, which it isn't.
 
 
In response to the Original Poster, I'd like to say that as a young black man of 18 years of age I feel really sorry for all the bad things that have happened to you and I assure you that this is not how all black people behave.

I live in Peckham, south-east London, where crime is prevalent and In response to your main question --->

"My question is, why is crime in the black community significantly higher than other communities? And (from my experience), why some black people are a bit more aggressive than the aggressive people in other races? "

I truly believe that firstly socioeconomic factors are extremely important but also personally I feel that we (black people) don't truly care enough about ourselves and others to really give a sh**t about crime or tackling it. Maybe its the media or whatever but needing money drives people to do stuff that they perhaps would never do. As long as there is the system of sick capitalism that exists strongly in the UK there will always poor people looking to gain a bit of wealth and if a majority of those poor people happen to be black then crime in the black community will always be higher.
And to the original poster, I believe the 'aggression' of those black people doing the crime does not truly mean that black people are more aggressive than others.
To be brutally honest with you, OP, every society has a social group which needs to carry around the bad stuff and in modern day UK I suppose black people are part of theat group, along with 'chavs' and the 'white underclass'. But let me ask you OP a totally random question, in the crimes that have been carried out against you, how helpful have the local police force been? The truth of the matter is that as a society we only seem to value money and/or those who have money. I feel its a bit sad really. Where I live, if your not in a gang selling weed and making Â£ your nothing. I guess what I'm really trying to say is that you cannot blame crime on a single race. The many black successful people that live in the UK are examples of this, its just a shame that in an attempt to safeguard their wealth (as everybody does) they are very reluctant to invest in the wider community that truly made them who they were. Sad really.

Yeah that was a bit of a rant but I don't care man, If you wanna hate on me go'head! nd do it!

I have to say i totally agree with everything you said there. good on you!! lol  
 
 
 
True say, my Mum wanted me to go to Oxford..and I thought..no way, they'll just be prejudice towards me, and the thing is that they would.
Took me a while to accept that fact.
I can imagine that other black people wouldnt accept it..this is a huge problem.

 

I wouldn't accept it either. I live in London, and I see people looking at me as if they haven't seen black people before or as if I'm going to rob them. Sometimes, I just want to say 'what are you looking at?'. And at other times, I just don't want to be part of this society because of threads like this. The thread poster isn't the problem, but it's the bigoted, racist, imbeciles that are.
 
 
- Over emphasied by the media.
- Racist police force - a black person can be up to 7 times more likely to be stopped and searched.
- Stereotype public more likely to report 'black gangs lurking around' than white 'groups'.
- Public may assume in a victim survey that the criminal was 'black'.
- Police forced to assume media's folk devil. E.G, the "black mugger". Police tackle the so called "problem" for statistics.
- Sentencing for black criminals is longer than white criminals, making the black criminal seem like their identicial crime was 'worse'.
- Very scarce positive representation of black population, over representation of negative minority. No discussion or little discussion on 'white people and crime'.
- Stereotyping, 'assumed they are guilty' means black people are more likely to be held in custody than whites. Not exactly helping their case against the court.
- Lack of role models.
- Some black minorities may 'assume' their negative label.
- Some black commuinities may stereotype police as racist and working against them, and hence may appear more suspsicious - may not be able to recieve just a caution.

oh dear what a load of racist mumbo jumbo lets all blame everything and everyone but the people themselves. lets indulge in fantasys and pass the blame.

maybe the black community has problems because it is not able to take personal responsible for its actions.

maybe they should start by blaming the evil gangsta rap culture which promotes all sort of crime and violence activity.

here we go again you are aware non white people are over represented at oxford? funny isn't it how indians and chinese do just fine at oxford but as usual black people must blame their failures on racism. how pathetic i am sick of the whining because other minority groups prove this sort of nonsense completely wrong.
 
 
money
 
 
Or you could just not live in south london..
 
 
As Eugene Terreblance once said you give the black people freedom and power and all hell will break loose. Im not saying this is to describe all black people but even under systems of slavery where blacks were treated much worse than now on average blacks acted as law abiding citizens but now a lot of black youths probably see the oppurtunity to commit crime and play the race card if they get caught.

sorry what are you on about i have an immigrant background. what exactly have you experienced?

have you experienced violence on the level of the OP by so called racism?

it is funny because black people are always going on about racism and when you ask them what they mean it is always about funny stares and things which cannot be proven.
 
 
Urgh I hate it when people give socioeconomic reasons. If that was true then why is crime by blacks so much higher than lower class white people. Race must be a factor. I don't see why this is so hard to accept. Certain breeds of dog are naturally more violent. Same with race. Stop denying the facts.

You realise 'socioeconomic' does not constitute a rigid, tiered system where people can be placed into discrete categories, right? The social aspect of socioeconomic includes culture and surroundings, which are by no means constant for people who are generally poor.

That seems disputable:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status .

People are trying to invent reasons that don't exist for fear of being 'racist'. Of course correlation doesn't prove causation but I think that the statistics create a very strong presumption that race is at least partially causative of crime.
 
 
The real racists are the people who give so much significance to race. So what if people with same skin colour as you commit crime? What matters is what you do.

Within arbitrary classifications of socioeconomic status, there is a large amount of factor variability.

It doesn't suggest that at all. A physical factor has no bearing on a psychological one.

pfff, what are you trying to claim..that racism doesnt exist anymore?
Again, you wont understand :P..
I dont live in the UK atm, my experience is from Austria which is generally more conservative and anti-immigration than the UK.
But I can understand what the person was saying and while I accept some of your points, I dont really think you understand :P..I dont believe that racism in the UK is sooo bad, but its still there of course.

It is impossible to predict a baby's future contribution to society, irrespective of their circumstances. Most poor children grow up without breaking the law.

 

I have no problem with the relative poverty of some people in the UK. I'm not proposing we eradicate it. Simply that they be limited to the children they can have. And whilst many do, many don't. Children in high risk areas need to be targetted, and other sanctions put in place, on prospective parents and the children.

Are you saying someone in a wheelchair is inferior to you because you can walk? The reality is that people in wheelchairs live very fulfilling lives and often go on to be some of the most creative people. It's all a very slippery slope if you ask me.

 

But what I'm proposing isn't genocide, so let's not try and invoke some sort of pathetic moral outrage by comparing my plan to the Nazi's?  

Oh, this wouldn't be worldwide, this would be a national policy. And we would move toward a society where having a malformed foetus carried to full term is seen as morally wrong, or socially unacceptable, after all why bring a child into the world that will have a lower quality of life? Why put that burden on yourself and those around you? When it can be aborted before it is ever a child, and you can try again, or adopt a perfectly healthy child in need of a loving home.

There are certain genetic disorders we can track and trace. If we have a high success rate with stopping malformed foetuses developing then there may not even be a need to breed out genetic disorders, as our screening technology advances we would just abort a few more feotuses that have serious deformities. If however that proves to not be viable, then we take high probability gene carriers out of the running. Ones where the chance of passing on serious hereditary disease is say, 20% or more. I'm not sure how we'd implement that. Some sort of health screening in order to recieve government help with a child? For those deemed unviable, well as I've said before, there are thousands of children in the UK in need of a loving home.

Speaking morally, and then you bring nature into it? Yeah....

Evolution as a natural process has already been destroyed by humanity. The natural selection part at least. We have come to the stage where we adapt the enviroment to us, not the other way round. You can argue a slow increase in height or intelligence may be evolutionary, but I'd put that more down to better standard of living, nutrition and so on. Evolution of the human race has stagnated, by the virtue of how we interact in the world around us. Eugenics is simply aritifcial evolution, or at least aritifcially keeping the race healthy and streamlined.

And to argue in terms of people is fallicious. I don't advocate killing anyone. But if the choice is between bringing a child into the world that is perfectly healthy, or one that will suffer from say, Downs, which would you choose? Clearly, when you can see the foetus is in such a state, the moral choice is to pick the healthy one. It will have a higher quality of life, so will the people around it, it will be more productive and happier, for the most part. I assume you're going to argue something about the sanctity of life, and I assume you disagree with abortion, so of course you wont agree with me here, I don't care.

 
Children aren't always planned but aside from that; the majority of the children born with your mentioned circumstances do not grow up to commit crime. So why stop all people in this situation having children if it is only the minority that is the problem?

 

Oh I wouldn't stop them all. Just the scummy ones. I probably didn't make myself clear. In my perfect world there would be some hoops you have to jump through before you can have a child. Simple tests, a medical and so on.

Children in high risk areas need to be targetted, and other sanctions put in place, on prospective parents and the children.

 

There isn't a ubiquitous mandate for what constitutes 'high risk', and there are multiple factors post-birth that can influence the child's development. The parents'/'s socioeconomic circumstances are not necessarily set in stone for the entirety of the baby's childhood.
 
 
 
Are you being serious?..actually do you have the stats to back up what you claim?

 

Not for the UK but this is pretty definitive for the US:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ho...ng_by_race.jpg 
 
 
 
No excuse. If you're not in at least some sembelence of stability you shouldn't have children.

And that is pure selfishness from their part, not the fault of society. A case of 'you have I want'.

We were talking about a specific type of criminal though. I'm saying that people such as you attribute their criminality to their socioeconomic situation, I attribute it to their parents and peers.

 

YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CRIME

You know..... I'm really getting a bit sick and tired of the pseudo intellectual types on TSR who actually believe they know now thing or two.

Three important things to understand:
Most crime is same-race: white-on-white and black-on-black. Most black people are no more dangerous than most white people. The crime rate is lower in white neighbourhoods because they receive, much better police protection than black ones It has little to do with white people being more moral or black people having some kind of criminal nature. Stories of black-on-white crime spread faster and farther because they seem more terrible. The belief that blacks commit most of the crime makes whites feel safer : They can avoid most crime by moving away from blacks. Except that it is not true : Whites commit most of the crime something that is lost sight of in all this talk about the black crime rate. So the sense of security is a false one. Further, the stereotypes make crime into a race issue, which means crime is not fought intelligently. Instead we get racial profiling and making it hard for those with a conviction to make an honest living. Which makes society more dangerous and more crime-ridden than it has to be, despite all the prisons it has built and all the black men it has locked up.

YOU KNOW NOTHING

And if your serious about fighting crime then you need step away from 'classic crime' and scary black muggers

THE REAL BIG ORGANIZED CRIME IS ALMOST ALWAYS WHITE

YOU KNOW NOTHING !!!

Russian mafia gangs and the powerful vory v zakone brotherhood are almost exclusively white, though some Uzbeks and other ethnic minorities are presented among their ranks. Italian organized crime is exclusive: Neapolitan camorra. European organized crime in general is white and forms a underworld web that beats black street gangs easily in power, prestige and money. Turkish Babas and organizations are exclusive white.

In France there are strong Algerian immigrant gangs and organizations but the upper echelon of French organizations are white. Very few black criminals have risen to the top there or in Britain despite numerous black criminals in those countries. Indian criminal networks and crime groups are also exclusive, meaning they do not accept blacks among the rank and file, not to mention in the leadership positions.

Now how this effects on people in the UK and their safety ?

These real organized crime groups are responsible for the flow of drugs into UK and Europe but they are white. They look respectable so you will walk past them in the street and no give them a thought. They are also serious players in the financial fraud scene. They smuggle weapons and supply the street criminals with weapons and drugs. And of course, they are the ones who operate together with corrupt officials and politicians. This has been documented for decades by now. They smuggle illegal DVDS, tobacco, are involved in the sex trade, identity fraud, Benefit fraud. You name they are in it. You don't know anything. You don't the economics of this real big crime. Yet you DARE come in here, with all your positions and postures and your silly views.

YOU KNOW NOTHING !!

There are no funds in the black ghetto areas which could pay up the tons of drugs they import annually into UK. It is the huge white middle and upper classes that consume casually the majority of the drugs in the UK. They have the capital for it. That is the economical fact. This is good to remember. The same goes for Europe too. Then, there are the stockbroker jugglers, into bonda and securities who are also organized criminals and who are the main reason why the average whites in the UK are in the deep S**T, loose their homes, insurances, get laid off from work. They affect the real security of white brits many many times more than any black street mugger or dope smoking gang-banger.

THESE PEOPLE LAUGH AT YOU

You hear me ?

Your pointing the finger at the wrong people. Not that I say that street crime is less harmful or anything. It has to be taken seriously too, but one has to remember the causes of it.
 
 
Cos you is racist bladrins, obvs.
 
 
 
There isn't a ubiquitous mandate for what constitutes 'high risk', and there are multiple factors post-birth that can influence the child's development. The parents'/'s socioeconomic circumstances are not necessarily set in stone for the entirety of the baby's childhood.

 

This is for me. Criminal parents for one. A history of financial instability. LAck of qualifications and steady job. All pretty good indicating factors.

 
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CRIME

You know..... I'm really getting a bit sick and tired of the pseudo intellectual types on TSR who actually believe they know now thing or two.

Three important things to understand:

Most crime is same-race: white-on-white and black-on-black.
Most black people are no more dangerous than most white people.
The crime rate is lower in white neighbourhoods because they receive, much better police protection than black ones

It has little to do with white people being more moral or black people having some kind of criminal nature. Stories of black-on-white crime spread faster and farther because they seem more terrible. The belief that blacks commit most of the crime makes whites feel safer : They can avoid most crime by moving away from blacks. Except that it is not true : Whites commit most of the crime something that is lost sight of in all this talk about the black crime rate. So the sense of security is a false one. Further, the stereotypes make crime into a race issue, which means crime is not fought intelligently. Instead we get racial profiling and making it hard for those with a conviction to make an honest living. Which makes society more dangerous and more crime-ridden than it has to be, despite all the prisons it has built and all the black men it has locked up.

I think people need to step away from looking at the classical crimes. As some one who has studied organized crime. I can the real big organized crime is almost always white. Russian mafia gangs and the powerful vory v zakone brotherhood are almost exclusively white, though some Uzbeks and other ethnic minorities are presented among their ranks. Italian organized crime is exclusive: Neapolitan camorra. European organized crime in general is white and forms a underworld web that beats black street gangs easily in power, prestige and money.

Very few black criminals have risen to the top there or in Britain despite numerous black criminals in those countries. Indian criminal networks and crime groups are also exclusive, meaning they do not accept blacks among the rank and file, not to mention in the leadership positions.

Now how this effects on people in the UK and their safety ?

These real organized crime groups are responsible for the flow of drugs into UK and Europe but they are white. They look respectable so you will walk past them int he street and no give them a thought. They are also serious players in the financial fraud scene. They smuggle weapons and supply the street criminals with weapons and drugs. And of course, they are the ones who operate together with corrupt officials and politicians.

THESE PEOPLE LAUGH AT YOU

Because they know your pointing the finger at the wrong people. Not that I say that street crime is less harmful or anything. It has to be taken seriously too, but one has to remember the causes of it.

 

Guess what? I haven't even attriubted crime rate to race once   Nice to see you've read my posts  

Oh and actually there is a point on racial profiling. Black Males are far over represented in the prison system. By a huge percentage. So actually, in an innner city enviroment it is perfectly understandable for black youths to be stopped more than white ones. It's not due to their race, but their situation and other factors. But, the fact is their demographic do commit a large percentage of crime in proportion, so yeah, crying about racial profiling is a little stupid.

And yes, white's tend to have the large criminal organisations in Europe and America, what of it? That's quite natural if you look at the demographics and nature of organised crime. There is a decent amount of organised crime in black communities aswell. And a large gang culture.

Oh, and I'd like to see your stats on the consumption of drugs please.

And it seems like you have a chip on your shoulder, is it heavy?
 
 
 
But what I'm proposing isn't genocide, so let's not try and invoke some sort of pathetic moral outrage by comparing my plan to the Nazi's?  

 

Did I say it was?   But as a side note, you have many characteristics that remind me of Hitler, he was a bigoted oaf too  

 
Oh, this wouldn't be worldwide, this would be a national policy. And we would move toward a society where having a malformed foetus carried to full term is seen as morally wrong, or socially unacceptable, after all why bring a child into the world that will have a lower quality of life? Why put that burden on yourself and those around you? When it can be aborted before it is ever a child, and you can try again, or adopt a perfectly healthy child in need of a loving home.

 

You haven't mentioned what the "policy" would actually be. Moving towards a society were malformations are socially unacceptable is a campaign and not a policy, like what's been done with smoking. I'd love to see the reaction when you start telling disabled people, ill people, etc that they're "socially unacceptable". You won't just have them as opposition but their parents, siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles, friends, etc. Now that's a hell of a lot of people. How do you propose to convince them all that their relatives are outcasts because they were born the way nature intended?

The other problem is that, as can be seen with smoking, being "socially unacceptable" doesn't mean that much - you still have people who smoke so you'll still have people who have natural births. This means that you'll still have alleles you don't want in the genepool...

And again, where does the money come from? You're talking about extreme medical breakthroughs to identify whatever genes you want, screening every single foetus that is conceived (that's a hell of a lot considering the number of miscarriages that take place + births), aborting these foetuses, and then the aftercare (and man is there a lot of aftercare). So not only do you have to fund all that but you'll need to increase the staff tenfold, find time for all the appointments, and find space for this influx of people wanting screens.

 
There are certain genetic disorders we can track and trace. If we have a high success rate with stopping malformed foetuses developing then there may not even be a need to breed out genetic disorders, as our screening technology advances we would just abort a few more feotuses that have serious deformities. If however that proves to not be viable, then we take high probability gene carriers out of the running. Ones where the chance of passing on serious hereditary disease is say, 20% or more. I'm not sure how we'd implement that. Some sort of health screening in order to recieve government help with a child? For those deemed unviable, well as I've said before, there are thousands of children in the UK in need of a loving home.

 

Yes but there are many more than we cannot track. And sickle cell anemia is considered a genetic disorder in some parts of the world, but in others it is beneficial. There are many more genetic "malformations" like it. What do you propose is done about that?

Also, these are all birth-related incidents. What would you do about other incurable diseases such as STDs?

 
Speaking morally, and then you bring nature into it? Yeah....

 

Maybe you need to use that dictionary of yours in this instance   There are many who would consider interfering so drastically in a natural process as immoral, that's what I was getting at.

 
Evolution as a natural process has already been destroyed by humanity. The natural selection part at least. We have come to the stage where we adapt the enviroment to us, not the other way round. You can argue a slow increase in height or intelligence may be evolutionary, but I'd put that more down to better standard of living, nutrition and so on. Evolution of the human race has stagnated, by the virtue of how we interact in the world around us. Eugenics is simply aritifcial evolution, or at least aritifcially keeping the race healthy and streamlined.

 

Destroyed by humanity? Are you trying to imply that it was and is wrong of us to treat people born with genetic anomalies? And you may put it down to better standard of living but what you think is simply not relevant when you're talking about such a scientific topic. And how do you know it has stagnated when it occurs over millions of years? You do realise that evolution can occur without natural selection.

 
And to argue in terms of people is fallicious. I don't advocate killing anyone. But if the choice is between bringing a child into the world that is perfectly healthy, or one that will suffer from say, Downs, which would you choose? Clearly, when you can see the foetus is in such a state, the moral choice is to pick the healthy one. It will have a higher quality of life, so will the people around it, it will be more productive and happier, for the most part.

 

But that doesn't address the point because unless you're forcing people to abort children, which is against human rights, then there is always the option that people will choose to bring "inferior" children into the world. You cannot predict what that number will be so the situation I proposed still stands and needs addressing.

And what happens if you have two people who are homozygous for a trait. They have no option BUT to have an inferior child, or will you just deny them that right?

 
I assume you're going to argue something about the sanctity of life, and I assume you disagree with abortion, so of course you wont agree with me here, I don't care.

 

Of course, I won't agree with you, but that's because social rejects tend to have views I disagree with. And FYI, don't have a problem with abortion so don't pretend as though you know anything about me.

And you didn't address any of my previous scientific-based problems.
 
 
 
Did I say it was?   But as a side note, you have many characteristics that remind me of Hitler, he was a bigoted oaf too

Oh you silly person. As I said arguing in terms of 'people' is fallicious. I'm talking in terms of stopping disabled people from being born. I have no problem with the people already around. Of course if you ask anyone if they'd like to have been born they'll say yes. But if you ask someone if they'd rather be born healthy or with a severe disability, then they'll almost always say healthy. These foetuses that would be aborted are not people, they are clusters of cells. Stop appealing to emotion, it's rather a stupid standpoint. The campaign would be centered around your responsibility to your children and society as a whole.

Of course that is a problem, but the point is this isn't a totalitarian system, just a nudge in the right direction. As I said, soft eugenics to start with, hell still pretty soft even at their most extreme.

The basic screening wouldn't take that much, pregnant women already have many tests and appointements. At our current state of technological advancement we would only abort the foetuses with genetic impairments we can see, or ones that have a high chance of having them. The cost wouldn't be that great considering all the tests we do already. And the abortions? So long as they are done early on there isn't too much hassle, or aftercare needed, as you can see with the way the clinics of today already operate.

We would start by only targetting serious disease and deformity. Downs, Muscular Dystrophy and so on. What do you mean about incurable STD's? No child is born with an STD, there is a chance of catching HIV during birth, but otherwise?

Please. All we do these days is interfere with nature. Are planes immoral? Cars, computers, ventilators, air conditioners....  

There is various evidence that links better diet and standard of living to increased intelligence, height etc. Those things put down to 'evolution' of humans inrecent times. The science isn't against me here. Get your facts right.

Oh, I've never said force. Just encourage. If you bring in an inferior child, don't expect the State to pick up the slack of an avoidable burden. You choose to have a child with Downs over a healthy one, you take care of it, not the state. Simple. As we move on, and declare to people that the risk factor for any child is too high, as I've said before, there are thousands of children that need loving homes. I don't see how it is morally prefferable to bring a defective child into the world, a surplus child, when there are perfectly healthy children already in social care, in need of loving family. If anything, it seems morally wrong.

Awwhhrr, bless, petty insult. How nice of you. And bearing in mind you appear to be Muslim, or at least a very ardent apologist, it is natural that I would assume you are against abortion.

And you've made none, none that are backed up anyway  
 
 
 
pfff, what are you trying to claim..that racism doesnt exist anymore?
Again, you wont understand :P..
I dont live in the UK atm, my experience is from Austria which is generally more conservative and anti-immigration than the UK.
But I can understand what the person was saying and while I accept some of your points, I dont really think you understand :P..I dont believe that racism in the UK is sooo bad, but its still there of course.

 

i ask what you mean by racism i hear this word all the time but what do you mean specifically and how specifically how it affected you?

and do not tell me i do not understand.
 
 
It's more to do with the fact that black people make up the majority of poor in inner london. If you went to 'white' cities where the majority of the poor would be white then yes you'd be robbed by white people usually instead.

EDIT: Whoa ten pages. My post has already been mentioned already then.

If a person is dead-set on believing something, then all evidence to the contrary will be ignored by them since it âdoes not computeâ. Arguing with them is senseless and a waste of time. So the reason I'm writing is not really for you, it's more for others to see the counter points. Black street crime resonates more in average population and it is easier for you to understand and comprehend. So to just present the bare numbers,while it may seem clear-eyed, hard-headed and fair, is extremely misleading. Especially when presented to white people who already have certain stereotypes about blacks. To assume from such numbers that there must be something wrong with blacks â as opposed to something profoundly wrong with how society functions â is racist and, for white people, self-serving. It also has the effect of making crime a black thing, which means little is done about it other than to hire more police and build more prisons.

To see black crime somehow apart from the big crime is seeing half the picture. It's a one way to make money when there are no jobs. People arenât born saying âI think Iâll become either a drug dealer and risk a 5 year stretch in jailâ As a member of a powerful criminal network you have access to all kinds of deals, illegal and legal, plus you have the backing of that network in case of conflict. So if and when you join some criminal organisation, you know that the idea is to make money.

Sicilian mafia did not kill those judges because they thoughed that was cool but to send a message : Do not F**K with our business. When you join a street gang your motives are more varied. It may be a cool thing to do, it gives you a sense of belonging and prestige around the hood. You get friends and parties, booze, drugs and girls.

My point is - If your gonna focus on crime then focus on the people who commit the most crime. They are white. So focus on them ?

YOU IDIOT !!

The street dealers are nothing but bullet fodder and are expendable. The real dangers are the distributors. You should be looking to the white âcriminalsâ who may impact your economy. Funny how they rarely get the big fish when ferreting out these crooks. They go for the easy marks instead. These street drug peddlers are only the symptom. If they had jobs and opportunities available to them from the get go, many would not even think if this type of lifestyle. They would be using their cunning for something productive.

All you âcasualâ white university drug users should think on this the next time you smoke a spliff. Bernie Madoff just got caught stealing 50 000 000 000. Just one white guy. And, as we now know it (financial crisis was partly caused by these guys). Now, I would like you to show me a single black embezzler who has stolen by fraud lets say at least 100 million. Guys like this guy can actually put whole towns out of business, with all its jobs and houses and population, black or white. And they have done so. These guys are more dangerous to the public than street corner hustlers. In Moss Side back about 15 years ago, the police and others sat down with community members and tested this theory. They set up on the location but did not bust the dealers. Instead they busted the buyers whom more than 95% where white middle class people. In less than a month the word got out and the trade collapsed so low, that the dealers moved to another location. And this was during the height of the first crack wave.

You see I live in Moss Side but I also go to university. I actually know who are the real drug users and it's not black people. The tons of drugs consumed in UK today, is consumed somewhere else than in the ghettoes. And yet, typical drug crime profile in the news and in peoples minds is that of a black drug dealer in a slum. In the UK it is estimated that in weed alone the illegal business could be something like a 5 billion pounds a year and white European organized crime controls large chunk of this illegal trade. Many of the so called russian oligarkhs, bilionaires, were once criminals or did business with the mafiya. Many of the vory have good connections to the establishment over there, they have friends in Duma and other high places. In Ukraine Leonid Kuzma, the former president of that country, was actually in cahoots with the ukranian crime organizations and ran the country pretty much the same manner as a gangster would.

YOU KNOW NOTHING !!!

Tiny Estonia was one of the biggest exporters of copper and other metals in the 90?s, even though it has no mines nor any other resources of that kind. There are examples everywhere how the real big crime functions. Even in Finland former prime minister was negotiating with white collar criminals who gets funds for political campaings and how much from these guys. In his official residence. The corruption investigations are still going on. Street crime is bad and it should be dealt with it, but at the same time one has to remember the really big players out there. They are the real movers behind the scenes and they have the power to influence on politics.

But listen it don't matter because I'm sure next time your walking down the street and you see group of black guys walking towards you...you'll think

"Oohhh black guys coming towards me I'm so scared   "

Recently, thanks to the meth epidemic, this has been changing because more and more meth heads are busted in the white suburbs and wealhty areas outside the poor community.

In the UK it is estimated that in weed alone the illegal business could be something like a 5 billion pounds a year business and white European organized crime controls large chunk of this illegal trade. It is totally controlled by white criminals out of major portion are not typical gangsters.

As I've said before, I have at no point made link between race and some sort of inate tendency to commit crime. What is undeniable is the link between balck inner city youths and a massive over representation in the judiciary system. You cannot deny this, it is fact, backed by statistics. Please at least acknowledge this before we move on.

All of your other points seem entirely irrelevant ot be honest. Yes we know we need to get the big fish, but that is inherently rather harder than catching the street dealers. These 'low-level' criminals have very oppurtunity afforded to them in British society, for everyone that turns to crime another doesn't, don't give me that bull**** about them being criminals because of lack of oppurtunity. And yeah, loads of middle class white people going into Moss Side to buy drugs?   I totally believe that. I'm middle class (so I'm, told) and White, you wouldn't catch me near Moss Side.

Clearly if you take away demand then there is a stop in supply, but that's really not the answer is it? Tkae away the supply, and there's nothing. And busting someone because they wished to put a chemical in their body? Hardly fair now is it? No, much fairer to bust the street dealer who is complicit in funding organised crime and willingly makes money of the addicted.

I really fail to see what nay of this has to do with issue at hand though. Yes we know all about the big crime networks and so on. That doesn't detract from the fact that black people are massivley over represented in the prison system, which I do believe is the original point. You seem to be trying to distract from that by pointing out that there are White criminals aswell? I don't think I've ever denied that. Most White criminal networks are more successful than Black ones in Europe, again, I'll acknowledge that, but I fail to see the relevance?
 
 
 
Oh you silly person. As I said arguing in terms of 'people' is fallicious. I'm talking in terms of stopping disabled people from being born. I have no problem with the people already around. Of course if you ask anyone if they'd like to have been born they'll say yes. But if you ask someone if they'd rather be born healthy or with a severe disability, then they'll almost always say healthy. These foetuses that would be aborted are not people, they are clusters of cells. Stop appealing to emotion, it's rather a stupid standpoint. The campaign would be centered around your responsibility to your children and society as a whole.

 

I'm not saying you have a problem with it. I wish you'd stop taking everything so personally sheesh  

And it's not appealing to emotion, now that's fallacious (which by the way you clearly don't understand the meaning of). You can't say genetically malformed foetuses are socially unacceptable but say that their product (a fully grown adult) is fine  

 
Of course that is a problem, but the point is this isn't a totalitarian system, just a nudge in the right direction. As I said, soft eugenics to start with, hell still pretty soft even at their most extreme.

 

Such a system would not work without a totalitarian approach for the reasons that I've mentioned, a nudge would not cut it. And if you argued that you would use a totalitarian system then you can bet on it that I'd have something to say about that as well. Not only would you have the problem of people who didn't want a screening, but also that of immigrants, who were new to these "social rules", spreading their alleles.

 
The basic screening wouldn't take that much, pregnant women already have many tests and appointements. At our current state of technological advancement we would only abort the foetuses with genetic impairments we can see, or ones that have a high chance of having them. The cost wouldn't be that great considering all the tests we do already. And the abortions? So long as they are done early on there isn't too much hassle, or aftercare needed, as you can see with the way the clinics of today already operate.

 

Well then basic screening is not going to achieve anywhere near the levels you were aiming for in your original post. They do a lot of tests at the moment but they don't abort every single foetus that comes back negative! So yes, the cost would be a lot more than you seem to think. Done early the abortion is fine, but there's a limit on the period these malformations you're talking about can be detected. By that time the amount of aftercare required cannot be deemed as "not a hassle".
And what about post abortion stress syndrome? The cases of that would increase significantly. What would happen if a couple repeatedly conceive a child that has to be aborted? The psychological damage can not be predicted, and you would have the responsibility to deal with that.

 
We would start by only targetting serious disease and deformity. Downs, Muscular Dystrophy and so on. What do you mean about incurable STD's? No child is born with an STD, there is a chance of catching HIV during birth, but otherwise?

 

I'm talking about this society you're trying to create, not just about children. Some diseases, particularly STDs, are not contagious yet pose a significant problem at present. How do you propose you would deal with that, if at all? If not, then how can you justify making it morally unacceptable for carriers of genetic diseases to procreate yet people with STDs is fine?

 
There is various evidence that links better diet and standard of living to increased intelligence, height etc. Those things put down to 'evolution' of humans inrecent times. The science isn't against me here. Get your facts right.

 

I never denied that. But nurture only lets you reach your genetic potential, which is influenced by evolution. And there are plenty of journals that suggest, contrary to your opinion, we are still evolving. So get your facts straight, since everything I said was scientifically accurate.

 
Oh, I've never said force. Just encourage. If you bring in an inferior child, don't expect the State to pick up the slack of an avoidable burden. You choose to have a child with Downs over a healthy one, you take care of it, not the state. Simple. As we move on, and declare to people that the risk factor for any child is too high, as I've said before, there are thousands of children that need loving homes. I don't see how it is morally prefferable to bring a defective child into the world, a surplus child, when there are perfectly healthy children already in social care, in need of loving family. If anything, it seems morally wrong.

 

So it's blackmail is what you're saying? Do as we say or don't expect any help from us? Sounds rather authoritarian if you ask me. Even smokers and drinkers that wind up in hospital are given support from the state and this practice is supported by the GMC, so that is a ridiculous argument. It is morally wrong to you because you clearly cannot see the necessity to have as diverse a genepool as possible, and you clearly look down on anyone who is not like you.

 
Awwhhrr, bless, petty insult. How nice of you. And bearing in mind you appear to be Muslim, or at least a very ardent apologist, it is natural that I would assume you are against abortion.

 

No worries, plenty more where it came from   And yeah, as I said, don't pretend as though you know me at all because you don't.

 
And you've made none, none that are backed up anyway  

 

Sigh   What parts do you need explaining then...

 
Speaking scientifically, the problem is that natural selection depends on a diverse genepool. If you have restricted the alleles in a given population, then they simply will not have the variation to adapt to a changing environment, and any Biologist will tell you that that is preliminary to extinction. Without the ability to predict the future, you cannot determine that an allele which is not useful now, will not be useful in the future. It may turn out that it's the key to our progression yet has been lost forever.

 

 
Sickle cell anemia is considered a genetic disorder in some parts of the world, but in others it is beneficial. There are many more genetic "malformations" like it. What do you propose is done about that?

 

 
And what happens if you have two people who are homozygous for a trait. They have no option BUT to have an inferior child, or will you just deny them that right?

 
 
 
 
 

As I've said before, I have at no point made link between race and some sort of innate tendency to commit crime. What is undeniable is the link between black inner city youths and a massive over representation in the judiciary system. You cannot deny this, it is fact, backed by statistics. Please at least acknowledge this before we move on.

 

Like most white arguers they have this need to narrow the argument and focus on a specific point that they feel they can *WIN* on

But. Ok. Letâs start with the first point then.

We can't get statistics on the number of crimes committed by black and white people, only the number of arrests and convictions. We cannot get statistics on which of the convicted people are guilty since we can only have the opinion of the court system as to their guilt, and that opinion assumes guilt from the fact of conviction. Even if all convicted persons are guilty, that does not necessarily mean that their sentences are just or fair, or untouched by racism. Longer sentences for black people will make the prison system majority black even when arrests are not majority black.

Your theory is the classic self full filling prophecy. If a person thinks someone is clever or stupid, they will treat them that way. If they are treated as if they are clever, stupid, they will act and even become that way. The person has had their prophecy fulfilled. To you, black people are criminals. Therefore we will be treated accordingly and is the reason why blacks are more likely to be arrested when arrested more likely charged, when charged more likely to be convicted and when convicted more likely to receive longer sentences. Furthermore, black people, as happens in Moss Side more likely to be the subject of frame-ups by officers who feel it is their duty to get "scumbags" (that is, anyone whom the officers are prejudiced against) by any means possible, including planting of evidence and lying about it.

Secondly I think you white students have a nerve lecturing us about crime and disobedience

 
 
 
 

Remember the student riots on the streets of London a few months back ?

Imagine if thousands of black people marched on the streets of London, caused havoc, looted shops, fought with the police and caused mayhem and bedlam on the nationâs capital ? How long do you think the police would wait before responding with MAXIMUM RETALIATION on hordes of black men who were throwing bricks at them ? If youâre looking for an answer, you might want to ask Smiley Culture. Only you canât, because heâs DEAD, his last moments spent encircled by fifteen of UK finest, while holding a single solitary brick, and merely threatening to throw it their way.

White folks go off, cause mayhem and we will get 100âs of explanations from the so-called experts, called in to make sense of it all. Black people commit random acts of retail violence and the whole world lines up to blame one of three things : Our black families (particularly their black single mommas) Our black DNA (as in the Bell Curve) Our defective black culture and inverted value system Whatever the case, our blackness is never, and I mean NEVER gets overlooked. Gang violence or knife crime in the cities and we've got the BBC and ITV running a story entitled: "A Shocking Look at Blacks and Crime," and every night time news program running stories asking, "What's wrong with the black family?" What seems reasonable to officers when confronting black men, that we probably have a gun would never seem reasonable when officers confront young white men. White boys donât get blown away at traffic stops, or choked to death in police cells. They arenât felled in a hail of bullets reaching for their mobile. The benefit of the doubt that white lives count for something is why white folks get to keep breathing, even when they do pose a threat to police

There have been dozens of riots by drunken, white college students often because of such earth-shattering events as the outcome of a sporting event or crackdowns on underage drinkingâduring which white males have chucked bricks, bottles, chunks of concrete, frying pans, rocks, frozen beer cans, and entire beer kegs at police. White criminals (Especially well off ones, as were most of the rioters) are afforded the privilege of individualization. You'll never even hear the term "white crime". "White-on-white violence?" What the hell is that ? Never heard of it.
 
 
 
This is for me. Criminal parents for one. A history of financial instability. LAck of qualifications and steady job. All pretty good indicating factors.

 

As you said earlier, services in this country facilitate social integration for all members of society. The minority of people born of parents with 'high risk' traits become criminals, because the majority utilise the facilities available to them.

Sigh   What parts do you need explaining then...

 

Instead of facts, persuasive language is used to develop the foundation of an appeal to emotion-based argument. Thus, the validity of the premises that establish such an argument does not prove to be verifiable

Seems to me to be what you did. A foetus and a person are not equatable. An idiot can see that. So please do try to see that. There is no question of people being undesiarable, just more people born with deformity being avoidable.

As I've explained, it's to do with social conditioning and the right incentives, not dragging people to screening centres. And immigration would be rather different in my society too.

As I've said, the process would move with technology, we would start with what is feasible, and increase as technology allows it. I'm talking quite generally for precisely this reason. I think such conditions would decrease as the stigma around abortion is removed, plus the social attitude toward the system would help people get through. There is always councelling available for those unable to cope.

We are talking about eugenics, soft eugenics at that. I wouldn't take any massive action against people already in the world. Assuming those with STD's pass the relevant tests then why would I stop them having children?

Please do provide sources.

There are two sources to support my side.

Talking morally? And actually, you'll notice smokers, drinkers, drug users etc are put at the bottom of transplant lists and so on. I just want to take the practice futher. If you intentionally harm yourself, in full knowledge of the consequences, why should we help you in spite of that. It's like turning up drunk for work everyday and then complaining when you get fired.

And I've answered all of those points  

 
Like most white arguers they have this need to narrow the argument and focus on a specfic point that they feel they can *WIN* on

Rofl. Racist much? You just go ahead and lump all of us Whites into one catagory.  

Actually I'm talking asbout the number of black men in prison. That's where I'm coming from. And while they may some small slither of truth to your argument about slef fufillin prophecy, that doesn't mean this amount of black men are not committing crimes. And I'd love to see your stats on longer sentances, racism within the judiciary system and so on.

And well for one, I never supported those protests. Infact I vocally opposed them   Secondly. That proves absoloutley nothing. I'd take just a quick google search to turn up thousands of results of black youths committing crime. Although I daresay most of them aren't students  

OH and bring up Smiley Culture? Are you a Gaurdian reader? A drug dealer dies in Police custody? MUST HAVE BEEN A RACIST PLOT OMGZZZZ!!!!! TEH POLICE ARE ALL RACIST BECAUSE A BLACK GUY DIED IN CUSTODY!!!  

And I think you'll find the vast amount of media actually bangs on about the socio economic situation of those involved in gang culture and black crime, and virtually never report the true statistics on the amount of black people in the prison system for fear of being labelled racist. So yeah, that chip on your shoulder is causing you to spout bull****.

And your next paragraph is absoloute rubbish.

And yeah, believe it or not Black people are a minority in this country. When you hear about a crime in Britain you tend to assume the person committing it was White and British unless told otherwise.  
 
 
 
i ask what you mean by racism i hear this word all the time but what do you mean specifically and how specifically how it affected you?

and do not tell me i do not understand.

 

When people judge you purely because of your sink colour?..
So for example, when you go into a shop and out of everyone you get the look from the shop-keeper etc..

Well you clearly dont, because you seem to think that there is no racism at all and its all Black peoples faults for being consistent on this issue. Now I agree that blacks (as a whole) shouldnt be banging on about racism all the time and should take responsibility as well and try and succeed, but I also know that there are still issues with Race. To say that there is no issue with Race is quite delusional I think
 
 
I'd like to point out that because of the gender pay gap, women are significantly poorer than men, more likely to need second jobs, work night shifts or be a lone parent. Yet they don't commit more crime. So I don't think you can just explain it away by poverty.
 
 
 
Rofl. Racist much? You just go ahead and lump all of us Whites into one catagory.  

Actually I'm talking asbout the number of black men in prison. That's where I'm coming from. And while they may some small slither of truth to your argument about slef fufillin prophecy, that doesn't mean this amount of black men are not committing crimes

 

If crime is being discussed it must be done so in itâs social context, not as straight forward numbers by rote. Anyone can look bad if these stats arenât put into context. For every black criminal who is incarcerated, there is many more white ones walking free. Many of these young people will commit many more crimes before they are eventually incarcerated for them. They are given many chances, however the young black man isnât. I am referring to white middle to upper-class kids. In the UK they collect crime stats for disingenuous purpose. Being âtough on crimeâ gets votes and secures council taxes for the judicial system. It is much more cost effective to round up these black men and lock them up under racially biased laws than actually seeking out the upper level distributors, banks and other businesses that profit from drug money or protecting the community members against the violence that plays out during drug transactions and beefs. The increase in the black jail population has also resulted in a boom in jobs in law enforcement for whites outside these communities. But people like you can inflate your egos by propagating simplistic rants based on your own racism.

Most of the drug distributorsâ are not black. They are white. The black dealers are street level operatives who basically make chump change in comparison to the distributors. Any black dealer who aspires to that of distributor, is quickly shut down. More whites consume drugs but a a disproportionate amount of blacks are incarcerated. Itâs like blacks are being punished for selling these drugs to whites. The police are not interested in targetting the middle men or the upper tier drug smugglers and users. Rather they target the users at the very end of the chain, and then justify to a âgullibleâ public that their main aim is to protect the rise of drugs. And in some the police also help to put drugs on the street.

It is not drug dealers who are filling up the prisons, like you might think, but people caught with drugs, few of them with a violent past. And in most cases we are not even talking about the hard stuff, like heroin, crack or cocaine, but marijuana - weed!!!

AND IT GET'S WORSE

Drug possession is a crime. That means you go to prison. And even after you do your time you do not get to start over clean. Almost no one will hire you. Most professional licences are out of the question too. Your life is messed up forever. So what becomes of you ? We already know : Within three years there is a 70% chance you will be back in prison. The very rights that blacks fought for like the right to vote and to serve on juries, are denied to those in prison and even many who have done their time. This directly weakens black political power. Millions of black men are having their freedom and rights taken from them and their lives messed up forever â for what ? For violent crimes, for hurting people? NO. For something that white people get away with all the time. Because it has nothing to do with drugs or crime but everything to do with controlling black men.

OH rubbish. You're basing this all on some percieved sense of injustice. Not fact. You're just talking bollox. And I'm the racist? All you've done so far is lump all Whites into one catagory and accuse us all of being racist. And why is that? Because you've been confronted with statistics you don't like.

And again, absoloute rubbish. You clearly know nothing about Police policy. They do go after these bigger dealers. But they also take out street level dealers, so they can make a maximum impact on the supply. If there's noone distributing at street level then there's no drugs. The reason more street level dealers get busted isn't because the Police are racist, it's because they're easier to bust. And you're talking bollox on the drug distribution front, until you provide a single statistic to back up your case you're just talking bollox.

So essentially you are saying more black people are in prison because they're all drug dealers? And you don't think we should arrest them because they're black?  

You're not even making any sense anymore. Talking about taking rights away from black people. If you don't want to go to prison, don't deal drugs, it's pretty simple.  
 
 
 
Now, let me me make it clear to you that I am definately NOT a racist. I don't judge people by their race, only by actions of individuals. ANY racist hate-filled comment on this thread WILL MORE THAN DEFINATELY be deleted. I'm aware that this is a taboo subject to talk about, so if you're black, please don't get offended. I didn't make this thread in an attempt to offend people, and spread hate.I know crime happens amongst all races, and I made this thread to find out why it's bigger in the black community. I also have quite a few black friends who are also concerned about this issue, so that's another reason not to take offence.

I live in south London, and I just read an article about Black people and crime on MailOnline, and that the figures released by the met police show that black men commit most of the crime in London.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...--victims.html 

My own experiences

I've never actually been successfully robbed, but pretty much all of the people who attemped to rob me (at school) happened to be black. Everytime somebody was aggressive towards me during school they almost always hapened to be black.

There was one black person in my class who didn't bring any equipment with him, so he asked me if i could lend him some equipment. I knew he had a reputation for 'borrowing' equipment and then not returning it back. Initially I said "no", because I was worried he won't return it back. Then he came up to me in an aggressive stance, and threatened to punch me and then take my compass...so I just had no choice but to give it to him. At the end of the lesson I asked for it back, he didn't give it straight away, and he put my compass in his bottom and rubbed it...then put it it in my hands?? Seriously??

I remember standing in the line while waiting for lunch at lunchtime at school, and this group of black students just barged in front of me. When I politely told them that I was there first, one of the black students gave me an EXTREMELY hard punch, and left my arm stinging for a while... There are endless cases which I can talk about, but I'd be here all day.

My mother has only been robbed twice, and on both occassions it involved black youths. When my mother first came into this country from South-Asia about 21 years ago, a group of black youths in Streatham approached her while she was in my Father's car. They asked her if she had any tissue, so she gave them some tissue, and then one of them grabbed her gold necklace and ran off with it. 3 years ago my Mother was at a checkpoint about to withdraw some cash, and a black youth behind her must have been looking at her pin, and she wasn't aware than the youth was behind her as half her attention was on my baby sister. Then more black youths came and told her to hurry up, and kept her distracted while another one took my Mum's credit card and ran off with it, and they knew my Mum's pin and took about Â£200. And yes, my mum did report this to the police, but they never managed to trace the boys down.

This experience is by far the most shocking experience I've had. In 2007 when I was in year 8, I was walking with two friends down tooting in South London, and a group of black teenagers approached us. They didn't go for me, but the went for my other friend. They asked him for a pound or they would take his phone. He didn't have a pound, but he begged and pleaded with them not to take his phone. After a bit of a struggle while they grabbed him, one of the black teenagers flicked hot ash from his cigarrete he was smoking into his eyes, then ran off with his school tie and phone. The police picked up the boy who was robbed and drived around to look for the boys who robbed him, but never found them.

My question is, why is crime in the black community significantly higher than other communities? And (from my experience), why some black people are a bit more aggressive than the aggressive people in other races?

 

Socioeconomic factors i.e. poverty rather than a "pre-programmed" behavioural trait based on race as some racist scumbags will suggest.

All you've done so far is lump all Whites into one catagory and accuse us all of being racist. And why is that? Because you've been confronted with statistics you don't like.

 

Listen, give it up, youâre not just beating a dead horse, youâre whipping the skeleton. You canât except the plain and proven truth. You have invested way too much in this and accepting the truth now would mean accepting that, all along, you have not been a ârace realistâ but an ignorant fool, and that, you cannot accept of yourself. Therefore, you will continue to bow down before the Crime statistics altar, beating your chest, shaking your beads, and making your sacrifice to the false god of false science. It has become a religion to you, that even the plainest proofs cannot dispel. You believe in this stuff because you desperately need a new theory of racism that allows you to separate yourself from the blue collar stormfronters. You will say âStick to the facts !! Stick to the facts !!â but your more guided by self-esteem than by facts.

 
And again, absoloute rubbish. You clearly know nothing about Police policy. They do go after these bigger dealers. But they also take out street level dealers, so they can make a maximum impact on the supply. If there's noone distributing at street level then there's no drugs. The reason more street level dealers get busted isn't because the Police are racist, it's because they're easier to bust. And you're talking bollox on the drug distribution front, until you provide a single statistic to back up your case you're just talking bollox.

 

You yourself admit that you have a self fulling prophecy when it comes to black people. Thus you put forward arguments that are exactly the opposite of social science. The scientific method begins with a hypothesis and then examines all the evidence, for and against that hypothesis, without presuming to know what the data will suggest in the end. You, on the hand, begin with an unshakeable belief - black people are dangerous criminals and out to harm whites - and then find any evidence you can that fits your hypothesis, while discounting all evidence suggesting that your preconceived notions are nonsense.

Your ideology justifies imprisoning black youth as a public service, while whites who use and deal drugs are simply misguided and deserving of rehabilitation, not imprisonment and instead of spending money on prevention, you prefer to build more prisons.

 
So essentially you are saying more black people are in prison because they're all drug dealers? And you don't think we should arrest them because they're black?

 

Your getting desparate now

I never said that all the black people are in prison for drug dealing nor did I say we shouldnât arrest them because they black. Your coming with straw man arguments now
Moss Side Time has position X. Steevee presents position Y (which is a distorted version of X). Steevee attacks position Y. Therefore X is false/incorrect/flawed. Knocking down a straw man argument is easier than than a real argument
 
 
 
When people judge you purely because of your sink colour?..
So for example, when you go into a shop and out of everyone you get the look from the shop-keeper etc..

Well you clearly dont, because you seem to think that there is no racism at all and its all Black peoples faults for being consistent on this issue. Now I agree that blacks (as a whole) shouldnt be banging on about racism all the time and should take responsibility as well and try and succeed, but I also know that there are still issues with Race. To say that there is no issue with Race is quite delusional I think

 

i did not say racism did not exist but the racism you speak of is not anywhere as bad as the situation the asian OP is in which is violence towards him and his family because of black racism and crime.

Let me get this straight. You are denying that black males are over represented in the Prison Population?

You are belittling my stance on the issue, when your entire argument comes from racist ramblings with not a shred of evidence to support them?

You sir, are the racist here.

I have presented no Strawman. I have not been racist. I have never said that a certain race is predetermined to commit more crime. I have merely presented fact and explained it.

You have spouted rhetoric with no basis. Frequently made wild racist remarks and sweeping genralisations. Based your entire argument on some sort of chip on your shoulder, essentially accusing the whole British Judicial system of being unreservedly racist. And I'm the one without a leg to stand on? Oh dear. Oh dear me.

At no point have I said Whites shouldn't be arrested.

Lets take this back to basics.

Black males are over represented in the Prison system. This is undeniable fact. Those men are there because they have committed a crime. This is not indicative of a more criminaly prone race, but perhaps culture, socioeconomic factors, social groups etc. However, such statistics do therefor justify racial profiling in certain areas.

Your position seems to be that there are White criminals, and that the White criminals have more sophisticated criminal networks, therefor arresting black men is racist? It's no argument at all.
 
 
 
Instead of facts, persuasive language is used to develop the foundation of an appeal to emotion-based argument. Thus, the validity of the premises that establish such an argument does not prove to be verifiable

Seems to me to be what you did. A foetus and a person are not equatable. An idiot can see that. So please do try to see that. There is no question of people being undesiarable, just more people born with deformity being avoidable.

 

You're missing my point entirely. I'm saying that if you're campaigning to say that genetic malformations are socially unacceptable, then you immediately label anyone already in this category as unacceptable - foetus or fully-developed human.

 
As I've explained, it's to do with social conditioning and the right incentives, not dragging people to screening centres. And immigration would be rather different in my society too.

 

Yeah I bet it would seeing as you're a right-wing nutjob, yet more resemblance to your old friend Hitler.

And you've already told us that your idea of incentives is blackmail, denying people the right to healthcare if they don't conform to your ideals.

 
As I've said, the process would move with technology, we would start with what is feasible, and increase as technology allows it. I'm talking quite generally for precisely this reason. I think such conditions would decrease as the stigma around abortion is removed, plus the social attitude toward the system would help people get through. There is always councelling available for those unable to cope.

 

Yes but what you're talking about is yet more cost. Counselling costs, abortion costs, medication costs, staff costs, aftercare costs, costs for beds, etc. This is a topic that I'm unfortunately all too familiar with thanks to the torturesome hours spent preparing for Medical school interviews. You would need some serious funding and this would be a complete overhaul of the current medical establishment (yet more costs -.-). Just look at the fuss created by the conservative policies, look at the burden the NHS move will place on taxpayers.

 
We are talking about eugenics, soft eugenics at that. I wouldn't take any massive action against people already in the world. Assuming those with STD's pass the relevant tests then why would I stop them having children?

 

When I said procreating I meant simply having sex and spreading the disease further, in the same way genetic diseases are spread further through the generations. I think STDs are a much bigger problem than "soft" eugenics.

 
Please do provide sources.

 http://www.time.com/time/health/arti...820836,00.html 
 http://www.scientificamerican.com/ar...getting-taller 

There are two sources to support my side.

 

Well neither article contradicts the point I was making but they do only refer to evolution across a couple of centuries. That is an outlandishly small time period to monitor any form of evolution. Also height is not a particularly good example to prove your point since there are absolutely no selective pressures in that category. Being short doesn't hinder your chances of reproducing and being tall doesn't improve your chances (yes I know in some cases that rule doesn't apply but it balances out across the board).

The following articles backup my point:

 Are human beings still evolving? 

 How much of human height is genetic and how much is due to nutrition? 

 
Talking morally? And actually, you'll notice smokers, drinkers, drug users etc are put at the bottom of transplant lists and so on. I just want to take the practice futher. If you intentionally harm yourself, in full knowledge of the consequences, why should we help you in spite of that. It's like turning up drunk for work everyday and then complaining when you get fired.

 

Ohhhh, you would have just failed a Medical school interview  

See the thing about self-inflicted diseases is that they are nowhere near as black and white as you've made them out to be, something the medical world understands. A large number of diseases can be deemed self-inflicted to some extent (diet for example, are you going to say not eating the right proportion of vitamins is a crime, or not having a balanced diet, or not staying fit and active?). Sexually transmitted diseases can be deemed self-inflicted considering the safeguards there are to protect people, do you suggest these people aren't treated? There may be underlying psychological issues if people are drinking or smoking and it is the responsibility of GPs to determine these; also kids may grow up watching their parents drinking and smoking and they won't know any better so might take up such practices. The healthcare in this country was established to provide treatment to anyone of any social status, and what you're suggesting aims to contravene that core principle.

Smokers and drinkers are not put at the bottom of the transplant list in the way that you think but I don't particularly want to go into the details of selection for transplant organs...it's a very long-winded process.

And in all honestly, if you're turning up drunk to work everyday then you clearly have some problems in your life that a GP would need to help you with. They would not just tell you to **** off.

 
And I've answered all of those points  

 

No you haven't...I haven't seen you address the necessity for variation in the genepool, the labelling of something as genetically malformed when it is beneficial in many places, or compulsion in having "inferior" children if you are homozygous for a trait...not at all.

No, you're missing mine. My point is not to bring more into the world, when you can instead bring perfectly healthy children into the world. Equating a foetus to a person is no comparison at all. I am saying to those people that it would be better if everyone was healthy, I think we can all agree on that. Inherently to you it might seem cold, but I'm not saying I don't want those people, I'm saying why have more children, with your conditions when instead we can have perfectly healthy ones? A foetus is not a person, so while you are trying to appeal to emotion and say I have a problem with people, that is just not true, I have a problem with knowingly bringing damaged foetuses to full term.

Ahh, insult. Bless. I'm a right wing nutjob because I don;t agree with almost uncontrolled immigration?   I think you'll find that isn't blackmail by the way. The State is not required to provide help for you to raise your child

Blackmail - Extortion of money or something else of value from a person by the threat of exposing a criminal act or discreditable information.

Money saved from the massive care burdern placed on society by the disabled. Money saved from the provision of child benifit to so many. Money saved from the social care system due to more children being taken off their hand. I'm not saying the costs will equal each other, there's no real figures on it, but it would go a good way toward it.

I don't. STD's are easily cured, for the people who present repeatedly I suppose you could charge them for their medication?

But they support mine, which you denied  

Your first source hardly supports your point. It simply says there is more diversity, not any change in terms of significant evolution.
And heritability is not evolution. All your second article talks about is inherited traits, I don;t think anyone is denying such things are inherited. But that doesn't imply evolution.

OH well, I don't hope to study Medicine, so that's fine. As I've clarified, self infliction over a long period of time with prior knowledge of the consequence. An STD can be caught on a one off, by pure coincidence or bad luck. Likewise an accident or so on. However being clinically obese? That doesn't happen overnight. That is not an accident. That is something you have activley chosen to do to your body, barring any sort of disorder of course. And there would be tolerances, I'm not talking simply overweight, but obese and decided by a medical professional. And don't bring social status into this. Plenty of working calss people get by without being drink addled smokers.

There would be plenty of variation still, I am just getting rid of malformation. Are you saying Downs is benificial? Muscular Dysthrophy? Yeah, they have so many benifits. And as I said before, if you are classified as too high risk to attempt having a viable child again, then there are plenty of children out there in need of loving homes.
 
 
 
Invariably threads of this nature and origin only spin out of control, with half the people arguing that you're a racist and the other half trying to rationalise crime committed by certain ethnic groups, because they want to appear as PC as they can.

 

As appose to the thousands on pointless threads on TSR

I am not at all equating a foetus to a person. You are looking at the situation rather naively since you cannot predict what number of people will choose to opt out of your screening. Therefore there will still be children you do not want in your society and they will grow up being labelled as inferior, when that is simply not true. Since these children cannot then go on to produce healthy children, would you then deny them the right to reproduce?

 
I think you'll find that isn't blackmail by the way. The State is not required to provide help for you to raise your child

Blackmail - Extortion of money or something else of value from a person by the threat of exposing a criminal act or discreditable information.

 

"Blackmail" is a very loose term and has many meanings:

"Force (someone) to do something by using threats or manipulating their feelings"

So yes it is blackmail if you are saying to people that do not conform to your ideals, they forfeit their right to healthcare.

 
Money saved from the massive care burdern placed on society by the disabled. Money saved from the provision of child benifit to so many. Money saved from the social care system due to more children being taken off their hand. I'm not saying the costs will equal each other, there's no real figures on it, but it would go a good way toward it.

 

Massive care burden? Disabilities are not anywhere near as big a burden on the NHS as other issues such as obesity, smoking, or alcoholism. You may reduce the burden a bit but you pile it on in larger numbers through the extra screenings, abortions, and aftercare. And then add all the other costs I talked about such as a health service overhaul, extra staff, etc etc.

 
I don't. STD's are easily cured, for the people who present repeatedly I suppose you could charge them for their medication?

 

So now you're privatising? Cos that'll go down well. And easily cured? Huh? Do you know something the rest of us don't?

 
But they support mine, which you denied  

 

What was your point again?

 
Your first source hardly supports your point. It simply says there is more diversity, not any change in terms of significant evolution.

 

My point was that your point was wrong. Your point was that humans have killed natural selection. My source says that that is not true. Ipso facto, it does support my point. And as a side note it does say that the matter of evolution is largely speculative. If a scientific journal doesn't claim to have an answer then how can you?

 
And heritability is not evolution. All your second article talks about is inherited traits, I don;t think anyone is denying such things are inherited. But that doesn't imply evolution.

 

That was in response to my point that nurture lets us reach our height potential, which is determined by our genetics, which is affected by evolution (however far down the line it may have been). You asked me to prove my statement.

 
OH well, I don't hope to study Medicine, so that's fine. As I've clarified, self infliction over a long period of time with prior knowledge of the consequence. An STD can be caught on a one off, by pure coincidence or bad luck. Likewise an accident or so on. However being clinically obese? That doesn't happen overnight. That is not an accident. That is something you have activley chosen to do to your body, barring any sort of disorder of course. And there would be tolerances, I'm not talking simply overweight, but obese and decided by a medical professional.

 

Do clinically obese people want to be clinically obese? No. There are underlying problems. It is the duty of doctors to address those problems. You cannot simply tell someone in desperate need of your help to **** off in medicine, because it is an altruistic field. There's a reason why some doctors put in extra time even though they don't get paid for it. The majority are not in it for the money, that is a bonus.

 
And don't bring social status into this. Plenty of working calss people get by without being drink addled smokers.

 

So? That makes it less of an issue? The medical field doesn't cater to stereotypes or to what a majority/minority do. They cater to the basic human right of healthcare. Each case is an individual case and if you treat it otherwise, you get someone killed.

 
There would be plenty of variation still, I am just getting rid of malformation. Are you saying Downs is benificial? Muscular Dysthrophy? Yeah, they have so many benifits. And as I said before, if you are classified as too high risk to attempt having a viable child again, then there are plenty of children out there in need of loving homes.

 

What about diseases like sickle cell anemia?

And once again, you are denying people the basic human right to reproduce.

"Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence."

They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence."

 

No, there would be stigma on their parents, not them. The point is that it is the wrong choice to bring a diseased child into the world, you can't blame the child for the choices of the parents there. And it depends on their particular deformity. If they have every chance of producing a healthy child, then mayhaps they can produce.

Not their right to healthcare. They're forfitting nthing but child benifit. They simply will recieve no government help to raise their diseased child.

Have any figures? This is why I'm keeping things vauge, I have no reliable figures on this. However, I feel a healthy society is something worth paying a little for anyway.

Not what I said. You are saying STD's are a big problem, I don;t think they are. The most common STD's are easily cured, Chlamydia, Crabs etc. Obviously there are the ones that are harder to treat, and we would have to see about those. But I'm talking about people who repeatedly present with crabs, Chlamydia and so on, then we would consider making them pay something toward their treatment. Seems fair.

That increases in intelligence, height etc are down to standards of living, better nutrition and so on, rather than any sort of evolution.

I see, the journal supports neither side, so it supports yours? The article talked only of diversity, not change from what we have now, merely more diversity within it. Hardly evolution.

And that does not prove evolution. Of course height is hereditary, but nurture lets us reach our full height. Again, this source did nothing to support evolution.

Have they done anything about it? Clearly not. It's not enough to not want to be obese, you have to do something about it. If you don't, then **** off  

As far as I'm concerned, you forfit the right to certain parts of healthcare when you intentionally harm your own body. Why should I pay to treat a smokers bronchitis? Or a Heroin addicts failing liver?

I don't feel procreation without reponsibility is a good thing. Infact I'm not even sure I agree it is a human right.

And as regards Sickle cell, please explain what you mean, you're the one studying medicine

The point is that it is the wrong choice to bring a diseased child into the world, you can't blame the child for the choices of the parents there. And it depends on their particular deformity. If they have every chance of producing a healthy child, then mayhaps they can produce.

 

You cannot attach a stigma to their parents for conceiving them without giving them the impression that they are inferior...they aren't. Had to urban dictionary "mayhaps", though in hindsight it was pretty obvious what it meant   And most of the genetic malformations you're speaking of are dominant alleles meaning the chance of someone afflicted with the disease passing it on to their children is high if they are genetically heterozygous and 100% certain if they are homozygous. So you haven't got much of a choice, ban their reproduction or let them carry on adding to your genepool.

 
Not their right to healthcare. They're forfitting nthing but child benifit. They simply will recieve no government help to raise their diseased child.

 

Oh, in which case that's not really much incentive. I thought that when you said "government help", that constituted any NHS treatment (provided in this crazy society of yours there is still state-funded healthcare). The majority of the help that parents get for disabled children comes from the NHS. If you deny them access to the NHS, then you deny them the right to healthcare.

 
Have any figures? This is why I'm keeping things vauge, I have no reliable figures on this. However, I feel a healthy society is something worth paying a little for anyway.

 

For which part? Because I think I might. I have mountains of research I used to prepare for my Med school interviews and what we're talking about here was part of it. Though it's too late for me to go through it now, I'll give it a go later if I must.

 
Not what I said. You are saying STD's are a big problem, I don;t think they are. The most common STD's are easily cured, Chlamydia, Crabs etc. Obviously there are the ones that are harder to treat, and we would have to see about those. But I'm talking about people who repeatedly present with crabs, Chlamydia and so on, then we would consider making them pay something toward their treatment. Seems fair.

 

Again I'll try to post evidence later but too tired at the moment. But, making them pay for healthcare goes against everything that makes our health system so brilliant. The people repeatedly presenting with those problems will be the lower class, also the ones who would happen to be struck hardest by the implementation of such bills. You'd just make the gap between rich and poor worse.

 
That increases in intelligence, height etc are down to standards of living, better nutrition and so on, rather than any sort of evolution.

 

Depends on what sort of time scale you're observing. In the previous few decades, I'd agree, but then evolution wouldn't have exactly happened in a few decades...

 
I see, the journal supports neither side, so it supports yours? The article talked only of diversity, not change from what we have now, merely more diversity within it. Hardly evolution.

 

It expressly says "First of all, humans haven't really changed the rules of natural selection. We might think that because we have culture--and with it all kinds of medical interventions and technologies--that we are immune from natural selection, but nature proceeds as usual." My point was simply that we haven't killed natural selection, which is what you asked me to prove.

 
And that does not prove evolution. Of course height is hereditary, but nurture lets us reach our full height. Again, this source did nothing to support evolution.

 

Again, I never said it did. It was mainly proof, which you asked for in response to my statement that nurture only allows us to attain our genetic potential, which is determined by evolution. It seems that we both agree on this point so I'm not sure where this argument is going. But if not, then which part do you not agree with?

 
Have they done anything about it? Clearly not. It's not enough to not want to be obese, you have to do something about it. If you don't, then **** off  

 

How do you know that? They may have tried...now you're saying that everyone should have the same will and drive set out by you? Unless you have been obese and lost weight, you cannot know the difficulties in the process. If you cannot truly experience it, then you cannot make such drastic policies on it. But either way, you're setting a timer on their obesity: "if you don't decide you want to do something about your weight by this point, then **** off".

 
As far as I'm concerned, you forfit the right to certain parts of healthcare when you intentionally harm your own body. Why should I pay to treat a smokers bronchitis? Or a Heroin addicts failing liver?

 

If money is your only concern then smokers collectively pay about Â£9 billion in tax, through cigarette packs, yet only Â£5 billion is spent on them through the NHS. So they more than pay for themselves, and a little bit extra to treat you.

 
I don't feel procreation without reponsibility is a good thing. Infact I'm not even sure I agree it is a human right.

 

You're not sure you agree it should be a human right or is ? Because it most definitely is...thank god (can I say that around you? it's just a figure of speech, don't get offended   )

 
And as regards Sickle cell, please explain what you mean, you're the one studying medicine  

 

Basically if you have the allele for sickle cell anemia then you're less likely to contract malaria. Therefore the allele is naturally selected by malaria, it is beneficial to have it in some cases. I take it you don't want me to go into the science so I'll leave it at that.

But this is just one of several similar diseases and you cannot predict what others there are at present or there will be in the future. It is therefore scientifically very hard to label something as "malformed", which is why "mutated" is used instead.
 
 
I blame the parents.

Poverty is not the reason at all. There are quite a few really poor people in my school, but most of them are very friendly and nice.
 
 
 
You cannot attach a stigma to their parents for conceiving them without giving them the impression that they are inferior...they aren't. Had to urban dictionary "mayhaps", though in hindsight it was pretty obvious what it meant   And most of the genetic malformations you're speaking of are dominant alleles meaning the chance of someone afflicted with the disease passing it on to their children is high if they are genetically heterozygous and 100% certain if they are homozygous. So you haven't got much of a choice, ban their reproduction or let them carry on adding to your genepool.

Oh, in which case that's not really much incentive. I thought that when you said "government help", that constituted any NHS treatment (provided in this crazy society of yours there is still state-funded healthcare). The majority of the help that parents get for disabled children comes from the NHS. If you deny them access to the NHS, then you deny them the right to healthcare.

For which part? Because I think I might. I have mountains of research I used to prepare for my Med school interviews and what we're talking about here was part of it. Though it's too late for me to go through it now, I'll give it a go later if I must.

Again I'll try to post evidence later but too tired at the moment. But, making them pay for healthcare goes against everything that makes our health system so brilliant. The people repeatedly presenting with those problems will be the lower class, also the ones who would happen to be struck hardest by the implementation of such bills. You'd just make the gap between rich and poor worse.

Depends on what sort of time scale you're observing. In the previous few decades, I'd agree, but then evolution wouldn't have exactly happened in a few decades...

It expressly says "First of all, humans haven't really changed the rules of natural selection. We might think that because we have culture--and with it all kinds of medical interventions and technologies--that we are immune from natural selection, but nature proceeds as usual." My point was simply that we haven't killed natural selection, which is what you asked me to prove.

Again, I never said it did. It was mainly proof, which you asked for in response to my statement that nurture only allows us to attain our genetic potential, which is determined by evolution. It seems that we both agree on this point so I'm not sure where this argument is going. But if not, then which part do you not agree with?

How do you know that? They may have tried...now you're saying that everyone should have the same will and drive set out by you? Unless you have been obese and lost weight, you cannot know the difficulties in the process. If you cannot truly experience it, then you cannot make such drastic policies on it. But either way, you're setting a timer on their obesity: "if you don't decide you want to do something about your weight by this point, then **** off".

The point is the child will be a burden. That is not the childs fault, it is the parents. As such the stigma belongs with the parents. And in that case they shall not have children, simple. Not their own anyway, born of the womb and so forth.

Ok. They recieve no government help for the child where the complications are a direct result of the childs illness. Of course the NHS would give them emergency treatment, but after that they would give them the most basic possible. It is down to the parents to provide quality of life, as it was their choicethat caused the situation.

If you have some figures on how much avoidable genetic disease costs the taxpayer that would at least be a ball park figure. And much appreciated.

Well see here is where I disagree. People who repeatedly present with Chlamydia or Crabs are clearly being irresponsible. As such they have to take the burden of their irresponsibility. So put a cap of say, 1 treatment every year for any STD, obviously this doesn;t count a single treatment for HIV or Warts or something, as that is not curable.

I'm talking over centuries. Was it you or me who brought up observable evolution in humans? I forget. But I stand by my view that we have all but halted evolution. Seeing as there is no definative answer I suppose we may have to agree to disagree here.

I assumed you were making the point that we are evolving. Natural selection applies in the context that some people die, but it doesn;t happen enough in the human race to allow for real evolution or any particular straying down a certain genetic path.

I've been overweight. I am now a healthy weight. I was never clinicly obese because I didn;t let myself get to that stage. I knwo obese people. They are slobs. The vast majority of obese people are obese because of the way they choose to live. It is their choice to eat fatty foods and do little excersise. As I;ve said, if they have some medical condition then that will be accounted for, but otherwise, if you want treatment on the NHS you maintain a healthy weight.

On them directly. What about secondhand smoke? Disbaility allowance paid to those with chronich Broncitius that have been declared unfit to work? And so on. And it's not simply money, they take up the time of doctors, nurses etc. Smoking is a choice, you pay for that choice in a monetary form, but equally you clog up the NHS, which I don't think is acceptable. If you stop smoking and develop cancer 5 years later then you're on for treatment, you have demonstrated that you value your health over your addiction. Obviously that's an arbitrary time limit, one would have to be devised. But whilst you are still harming your body, why should the NHS repair it?

Oh I know it is, I just don't agree with it. Just as I don't agree with many other cases of 'Human Rights'. Especially when it comes to health and criminals. If I had my way they would change.

In that case no, Sickle Cell would still be on the bad list seeing as we have medication to stop Malaria. It's an obselete advantage.
 
 
 
To answer that you need to look at why there is inner-city deprevation. After all, crime is an economic issue, not a racial one.

 

Isn't crime a social issue? Not all poor people are criminals.

I'd guess there is a stronger correlation between absent parents and wayward children, than there is between low wages and criminal activities.

True that. But then again not all people with social issues turn out to be criminals. I'd say it'd be a combination of both social and economic issues - they influence each other a lot anyway.
 
 
 
The point is the child will be a burden. That is not the childs fault, it is the parents. As such the stigma belongs with the parents. And in that case they shall not have children, simple. Not their own anyway, born of the womb and so forth.

 

But that suggests that they are inferior. I fail to see how having a physical disability should make someone in any way inferior to you or I. For all you know, their mental capacity could be ten times, hell one hundred times yours! Who's superior then? And you cannot deny people their right to reproduce, and if you do then that is a whole new issue.

 
Ok. They recieve no government help for the child where the complications are a direct result of the childs illness. Of course the NHS would give them emergency treatment, but after that they would give them the most basic possible. It is down to the parents to provide quality of life, as it was their choicethat caused the situation.

 

So the child would suffer for their choice? You would deny him the right to much needed help to allow him to make the most of a bad situation and live a better quality of life?

 
If you have some figures on how much avoidable genetic disease costs the taxpayer that would at least be a ball park figure. And much appreciated.

 

I'll post em up when I can find em

In this society, you're trying to improve people's quality of life. So now you're prepared to sentence people to death, or at the least a much lower quality of life? Especially when that contravenes everything our health service was established for.

 
I'm talking over centuries. Was it you or me who brought up observable evolution in humans? I forget. But I stand by my view that we have all but halted evolution. Seeing as there is no definative answer I suppose we may have to agree to disagree here.

 

I think it was me. We cannot observe evolution taking place unless we monitor the genome for every single human. And evolution takes millions of years, not decades and not centuries. But let's disagree I guess.

 
I assumed you were making the point that we are evolving. Natural selection applies in the context that some people die, but it doesn;t happen enough in the human race to allow for real evolution or any particular straying down a certain genetic path.

 

Well evolution doesn't need natural selection to occur anyway, provided there are sufficient resources. That article would suggest natural selection is still occurring, but major evolution is not; obviously we're not going to suddenly grow wings or anything.

 
I've been overweight. I am now a healthy weight. I was never clinicly obese because I didn;t let myself get to that stage. I knwo obese people. They are slobs.

Yes that may be, but it's because they don't have the same will or drive as you. Will and drive are individual to each and every person, it is a psychological state. How can you tell people that they are not entitled to treatment because they, for whatever reason (maybe depression), have not developed the same sense of motivation as you? And it's a bit of generalisation to say that all of them have tried and given up...

Because it is the NHS' job to help anyone who needs their help? Regardless of their situation. If you say otherwise then you sentence them to death, what's the point of a healthcare system that chooses who lives or dies?

 
Oh I know it is, I just don't agree with it. Just as I don't agree with many other cases of 'Human Rights'. Especially when it comes to health and criminals. If I had my way they would change.

 

Glad you don't have it your way then   I think that our human rights are perfect in all honesty. We shouldn't be looking to change them but establish them better.

 
In that case no, Sickle Cell would still be on the bad list seeing as we have medication to stop Malaria. It's an obselete advantage.

 

Tell that to the near 1 million people who die from malaria every year. And that was only one example, it is the most well-known example. There are actually many diseases like it that offer various benefits, and there will undoubtedly be many more in the future.
 
 
 
Those men are there because they have committed a crime. This is not indicative of a more criminaly prone race, but perhaps culture, socioeconomic factors, social groups etc. However, such statistics do therefor justify racial profiling in certain areas.

 

To listen to white folks like you, the fact that black people commit a disproportionate amount of crime is enough to warrant heightened suspicion of black people. As for the humiliation experienced by those innocents unfairly singled out, stopped, and searched ? Well, they should understand that such mistreatment is the price they'll have to pay, as long as others who look like them are heavily represented in various categories of criminal mischief.

Firstly you should understand what is meant by racial profiling.

Racial profiling means two things.

1) The over-application of an incident-specific criminal description in a way that results in the stopping, searching, and harassment of people based solely or mostly on skin color alone. An example would be the decision by police in Moss Side town a few years ago to question every black male in the local university after an elderly white woman claimed to have been raped by a black man (turns out he was white). So while there is nothing wrong with stopping black men who are 6'2", 200 pounds, driving Ford Escorts, if the person in a particular local crime is known to be 6'2", 200 pounds, and driving a Ford Escort, but when that description is used to randomly stop black men, even who aren't 6'2", aren't close to 200 pounds, and who are driving totally different cars, then that becomes a problem.

2) The disproportionate stopping, searching, frisking, and harassment of black people of uncovering a crime, even when there is no crime already in evidence for which a particular description might be available. In other words: stopping black folks for drugs.

This is why general crime rates are irrelevant to the profiling issue. Police don't randomly stop and search people in the hopes of turning up last night's off licence robber. They have more specific information to go on in those cases. Most racial profiling is to do with drugs. Whites are more likely to use (and thus possess at any given time) drugs. Blacks are more likely than whites to have been approached by someone offering to sell us drugs during the past month, we are less likely to have actually used drugs in the last 30 days. Most drug busts are not for dealing, but for POSSESSION. Drug busts for drugs trafficking donât stem from random searches of persons or vehicles but rather, tend to take place after a carefully devised sting operation and intelligence gathering, leading to focused law enforcement efforts.

Police hunches about who is in possession of drugs, guns or who is wanted for commission of a violent crime turn out to be horribly inaccurate. Despite being stopped and searched more often, blacks are less likely to be arrested because we are less likely to be found with evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Despite police claims that they only stop and search black people more often because we engage in suspicious behavior more often, if the âhit ratesâ for us are no higher than, and even lower than the rates for whites, this calls into question the validity of the suspicious action criteria. If we seem suspicious more often, but are actually hiding something less often, then by definition the actions deemed suspicious should be reexamined, as they are not proving to be logical at all, let alone the result of good police work. Indeed, they appear to be proxies for racial stops and searches. The fact remains that the typical offender in violent crime categories is white. Although in simple numerical terms, whites commit three times more violent crimes each year than blacks, and whites are five to six times more likely to be attacked by another white person than by a black person, to you, this is irrelevant.

Additionally, you are selective in terms of the kinds of racial profiling you support. Although whites are a disproportionate percentage of all drunk drivers and although drunk driving contributes to the deaths of around 450 people each year (More than 1 day), you wonât suggest drunk driving roadblocks be set up in white areas where the âhit ratesâ for catching violators would be highest. Likewise, though white uni students are considerably more likely to binge drink (often underage) and use drugs than black college students, no one suggests that police or campus cops should regularly stage raids on white college campuses or dorm rooms occupied by whites, even though the raw data would suggest such actions might be statistically justified. Whites are also nearly twice as likely to engage in child sexual molestation, relative to blacks. Yet how would the world react to an announcement that adoption agencies were going to begin screening out white couples seeking to adopt, or subjecting them to extra scrutiny, as a result of such factual information ?

The bottom line is that racial profiling doesn't happen because data justifies the practice, but rather because those with power are able to get away with it, and find it functional to do so as a mechanism of social control over those who are less powerful. This is the system working as intended, keeping people afraid of blacks and committed to the maintenance of the system, by convincing everyone that black folks folks are a danger to whites peoples well-being, which then must be safeguarded by a growing prison-industrial complex and draconian legal sanctions. Until and unless the stereotypes that underlie racial profiling are attacked and exposed as a fraud, the practice will likely continue: not because it makes good sense, but because racist assumptions about dangerâreinforced by media and politicians looking for votesâlead everyone to think that it does.

 
Lets take this back to basics.Black males are over represented in the Prison system. This is undeniable fact.

 

You said that before

In 1964 90% of the people who were locked up were white. In 2011 these figures totally flipped with 2/3 of the people in prison were black. Now there are ONLY two possible theories that can explain this.

Theory 1)

The 1st is that white people said to themselves

"You know, were TIRED of all this crime stuff were doing, were TIRED of filling the jails, were just going to shape up, get right" and black people on seeing this said "Hey !! Wait a minute !! If white people aren't going to do it, were just going to move right on in there and weâll do it, GODDAMIT !! "

Theory 2)

That there has been an increased concentration of law enforcement resources after 1964. You see, after 1964, there was turning point, formal discrimination was out-lawed. No blacks signs were not allowed. So if you have one mechanism of social control which keeps certain people in their place that is no longer allowed, but you still want to keep certain people in their place, and that desire DID NOT go away because laws got passed, you have to have a different method to do that.

How do you do that ?

Well, you increasingly criminalize certain people and their actions, and you focus your attentions on ONLY certain people committing those actions, because most people violent crime is committed by whites. But I guess itâs drugs in which whites have used most to lock black people up even though most illegal drugs users are white but very few whites get sent to prison. Most of the black people who go to prison for drugs are in there for POSSESSION, not DEALING. The penalties for crack use are three times as high as those for cocaine use. It doesn't take much to figure out why the drug of choice in the white community is treated with so much more leniency than the drug that constitutes the only affordable drug in the poor black community. Blacks face arrest rates for drug law violations that are 5, 10, even 50 times higher than the rates for whites despite less rates of illegal drug usage.

You see, because black people tend to be poorer, and tend to live in inner cities more than white people, our activities are more exposed to the public, and more likely to be the subject of government intervention. Whites are selling drugs in their houses, clubs, bars or places of work, basically not on the street. Black people involved with drugs are more likely to be arrested, when arrested more likely charged, when charged more likely to be convicted, and when convicted more likely to receive longer sentences. Furthermore, black people are more likely to be the subject of frame-ups by officers who feel it is their duty to get "scumbags" (that is, anyone whom the officers are prejudiced against) by any means possible, including planting of evidence and lying about it.

As I said before we cannot get statistics on the number of crimes "committed" by black and white people, only the number of ARRESTS and CONVICTIONS. Similarly, we cannot get statistics on which of the convicted people are guilty since we can only have the opinion of the court system as to their guilt, and that opinion assumes guilt from the fact of conviction. Further, even if all convicted persons are guilty, that does not necessarily mean that their sentences are just or fair, or untouched by racism. Longer sentences for black people will make the prison system majority black even when arrests are not majority black.
 
 
 
But that suggests that they are inferior. I fail to see how having a physical disability should make someone in any way inferior to you or I. For all you know, their mental capacity could be ten times, hell one hundred times yours! Who's superior then? And you cannot deny people their right to reproduce, and if you do then that is a whole new issue.

So the child would suffer for their choice? You would deny him the right to much needed help to allow him to make the most of a bad situation and live a better quality of life?

I'll post em up when I can find em  

In this society, you're trying to improve people's quality of life. So now you're prepared to sentence people to death, or at the least a much lower quality of life? Especially when that contravenes everything our health service was established for.

Their mental capacity can be many things. But if they lack all ability to live by themselves then why take that chance based on what if? The fact is the vast majority of them turn out to not be geniuses. And what of Downs? Never known some great intellect to be found there. Just a drain on resources.

I will have denied them nothing, their parents would have denied them everything. Including quality of life.

Ok  

I want people to take responsibility for their actions. By continually contracting wholly avoidable conditions through their own responsibility they have lowered their standard of life. Not I. Now of course accidents do happen, hence why the tolerances are there. But if you continually present with such self inflicted conditions, then you pay for the consequences, not the tax payer.

Ok. As you've said, we'll have to disagree to an extent here.

As I've said, mental condition will be taken into account. But people have to have a sense of responsibility. You can't say, 'Oh I'm fat because I lack will power, it's not my fault.' It is entirely your fault. It is your body, your life, your choice.

But it's not the healthcare system that has decided. It is you, the individual. You know what will happen if you carry on, and you do it regardless, that is your choice, not the system's.

That's as may be. Personally I think the Human Rights of the responsible, law abiding majority take precedence over those who choose to commit crime, or harm themselves. Equally, I think Human Rights should go hand in hand with Human Responsibility, which is a certain respect and dedication to the futherment of human kind.

How many British people die of Malaria? I'm talking for Britain. Obviously such schemes would never work world wide.

Most of the black people who go to prison for drugs are in there for POSSESSION, not DEALING. The penalties for crack use are three times as high as those for cocaine use. It doesn't take much to figure out why the drug of choice in the white community is treated with so much more leniency than the drug that constitutes the only affordable drug in the poor black community. Blacks face arrest rates for drug law violations that are 5, 10, even 50 times higher than the rates for whites despite less rates of illegal drug usage.

You see, because black people tend to be poorer, and tend to live in inner cities more than white people, our activities are more exposed to the public, and more likely to be the subject of government intervention. Whites are selling drugs in their houses, clubs, bars or places of work, basically not on the street. Black people involved with drugs are more likely to be arrested, when arrested more likely charged, when charged more likely to be convicted, and when convicted more likely to receive longer sentences. Furthermore, black people are more likely to be the subject of frame-ups by officers who feel it is their duty to get &quot;scumbags&quot; (that is, anyone whom the officers are prejudiced against) by any means possible, including planting of evidence and lying about it.

As I said before we cannot get statistics on the number of crimes &quot;committed&quot; by black and white people, only the number of ARRESTS and CONVICTIONS. Similarly, we cannot get statistics on which of the convicted people are guilty since we can only have the opinion of the court system as to their guilt, and that opinion assumes guilt from the fact of conviction. Further, even if all convicted persons are guilty, that does not necessarily mean that their sentences are just or fair, or untouched by racism. Longer sentences for black people will make the prison system majority black even when arrests are not majority black.

 

Oh wow. Are you really quite stupid? Of course it does! If a certain type of person is more likely to commit crime then people of that type should be searched more in regards to the relavent crime! If it's trans-atlantic terrorism, then yeah, stop Arabs and distinctly Muslim men more. If it's gang, drug or violent offenses related in the inner city, stop black youths more. If that's what gets results. To say otherwise is to show your clear insecurity and over sensative nature. If my profile makes me more likely to commit a certain crime then I'll not begruddge the Police having more suspicion on me. It's common bloomin' sense.

And that's just heresay. But so what if it did happen? The Police get things wrong, such occurances are not common. A kid in my year was caught carrying a knife once, I barely even knew the lad, but we were all talked to because we were lads of the same age, in the same percieved social group and so possibley similar influences. The difference is I understand that, and am willing to have a little inconvienience to help stop crime. You, you with your chip on your shoulder, so clearly, you make a race issue out of it. And it's a little pathetic.

Have you noticed how they stop white folk for the same thing? But hey, guess what, maybe in that area there is a high proportiuon of people with drugs. Maybe in that area there are more black people, guess it would still be racist to stop more black people though wouldn't it?   What if those black guys dress and act like your typical hoodlum? Still racist to stop them I guess?   There surely can't be any other reason for stopping them than their skin colour right?  

Got any statistics on that? You spout a lot of things, but you have no evidence to back it up. Until you present me with a source for your claims other than personal experience I'm going to go ahead and call bull**** on most of what you are saying.

I thought you had a problem with racial profiling? Well black men are the most responsible for gang rape. 67% of gun offences in London are committed by black folk. They make up 54% of street crime convictions. They make up 32% of sex offences in London. Now none of these are things that are gunna get you arressted by being stopped on the street, so how does your hypothesis stand up? Oh and by the way, Black people make up just 12% of London's population. There you go, evidence right there on the over representation of black men involved in crime, and I don't see how you can blame these crimes on racism.

Heh.

I'm having trouble finding a statistic for the amount of black people in Britain in the 60's, but know they make up around 2.5%, with another 1.5% mixed race, so shall we round the figure up to 3%? What we can also observe over the last 5 decades or so is the trend in mass migration. There has been a massive amount of immigration from African and Carribean countries. So we can take something from that. Equally, during the times of overt racism crimes probably were significantly lower in the Black community, as they had less protection from discrimination, less association with Whites. And with a smaller insular, ethnic social group less crime could take place within that structure. Add to that the monopolies that crime families had on pretty much every city in Britain at that time, well those all rather go towrd explaining the phenomena. Also, at this juncture I would ask again, where are you getting your statistics from? Mine all come from statistics.gov.uk and I can you link you to all of them. I'd like to see you do that with yours.

And that'd be because of the classification of Crak   We have these things called experts, and they look at drugs and give them classifications. If you want to argue with them, then go ahead, I'll not take your word over theirs. You want to explain everything away with racism, rather than objective fact. And of course a large portion of the Black community is poor, so it follows that a portion will commit crime. It's really rather their fault if they get caught for actually committing a crime! You never seem to acknowledge that these people actually are criminals, all you want is for them to be victimes of racism. And yeah, most violent crime isn't committed by Whites.

 

So you are telling me that every Police officer, Judge, Parole Officer, Prison Officer etc is a racist? There's all some big British conspiracy to keep the Black man down?  

Ok.
 
 
 
Their mental capacity can be many things. But if they lack all ability to live by themselves then why take that chance based on what if? The fact is the vast majority of them turn out to not be geniuses. And what of Downs? Never known some great intellect to be found there. Just a drain on resources.

 

Vast majority? Do you have any statistics? And we're not talking about them being geniuses in the Einstein sense of the word, I'm talking about them not being inferior when there's plenty who are more intelligent then "normal" people. Being physically disabled doesn't mean they cannot contribute greatly to society. And sure Down's is an exception, but do you have any evidence that shows the parents of Down's children would have aborted if they could? Many actually were aware but decided to have the child anyway, they say that it was one of the best decisions they made and thoroughly rewarding. Afterall, it's these types of people you'll have to convince and I know from experience that they won't have any of it.

And the entire medical industry is based on chance and "what if?". Even screenings aren't 100% accurate, doctors cannot say with certainty whether a child will have a problem or not, which is why many parents go through with pregnancies anyway.

 
I will have denied them nothing, their parents would have denied them everything. Including quality of life.

 

I don't look down on people who've decided to go through with pregnancies knowing there's a chance the foetus will be physically challenged, I think they're extremely courageous and not superficial. But what you're saying will be denying the children something. You will be denying them healthcare because of a decision their parents made. The children did not have a say in the matter. It's not their parents who are denying them healthcare...

 
I want people to take responsibility for their actions. By continually contracting wholly avoidable conditions through their own responsibility they have lowered their standard of life. Not I. Now of course accidents do happen, hence why the tolerances are there. But if you continually present with such self inflicted conditions, then you pay for the consequences, not the tax payer.

 

The state may not have lowered their standard of life, but it's the state's job to improve it and rightly so. People pay tax for a reason, because it could be them in that situation. It is a core principle of our country and will not change. Even America is campaigning to establish a state system like ours, but I suppose if you don't like the way things are run here then you could always move to America eww  

Someone who repeatedly plays football may present with an injury. Now they don't have to play football, but they choose to so is that self-inflicted?

And who decides when you've reached the end of the line? Every case is different, every single person will have a higher risk factor for various conditions, therefore every single person should have a different level of tolerance. But if you start looking at each case in that much detail, you waste time and money, both extremely valuable. And each person has the right to know what their tolerance level is in advance, that is something that is impossible to achieve.

 
As I've said, mental condition will be taken into account. But people have to have a sense of responsibility. You can't say, 'Oh I'm fat because I lack will power, it's not my fault.' It is entirely your fault. It is your body, your life, your choice.

 

We both agree that noone wants to be obese. Will power can therefore be the only factor restricting people from losing weight, and that is not something that is uniform across the population, else you'd have everyone getting straight A*s during the course of their education. Not to forget that obesity is linked to genetics so whilst someone might eat and eat yet not get fat, another person could easily swell up. And one person might have to put in a hell of a lot more effort than someone else to reach the same weight, it's just not fair to put such a drastic cap on it.

 
But it's not the healthcare system that has decided. It is you, the individual. You know what will happen if you carry on, and you do it regardless, that is your choice, not the system's.

 

The system is there to help you, regardless of your choice. That is what the people want, that is what they choose to back. You cannot sentence someone to death because of what looks like lifestyle choices at the surface. The medical field does not work superficially and will simply not allow it.

 
That's as may be. Personally I think the Human Rights of the responsible, law abiding majority take precedence over those who choose to commit crime, or harm themselves. Equally, I think Human Rights should go hand in hand with Human Responsibility, which is a certain respect and dedication to the futherment of human kind.

 

So you think people should be able to forfeit their human rights as well? The whole reason the Human Rights Act was established was so that anyone who was...human, would be protected. Anyone. Else the whole concept of it is pants.

 
How many British people die of Malaria? I'm talking for Britain. Obviously such schemes would never work world wide.

 

Obviously malaria is not a problem in the UK but I keep saying that I was using it as an example because it is one of the most notable, there are other alleles like sickle cell anemia. And a well-thought out scheme is one that can work world wide, whether or not you choose to implement it across the globe.

The problem with your hypothetical society is that you're restricting healthcare. Anyone in the medical field will tell you that once you start restricting healthcare, you lay the foundations for the establishment of a black market. It happened with abortion (and still does in many parts of the world); when abortion was restricted women would get the procedure done on the black market, which is so unbelievably dangerous I can't stress it enough. People who cannot afford your healthcare will look for cheaper alternatives, which again is very dangerous since it becomes cost over quality. Doctors will not support that and the people (especially the lower class since it affects them the most) will not support it, therefore you would not be able to pass a bill for it. Besides, why would people want to pay so much tax when they'll have to fork out bills to pay for their healthcare anyway on top of it all?

Besides, why would people want to pay so much tax when they'll have to fork out bills to pay for their healthcare anyway on top of it all?

 

They're hardly going to say the opposite to anyone though, are they? You and I both know the sort of judgement they'd recieve. And we're talking in terms of people. I assure you, if he I had my way only the intelligent would reporduce, toi an extent anyway. But no, back on topic. I'm not arguing that some people with disabilities aren't clever, but they are disabled. There are far more healthy people who are intelligent. The argument doesn't really work, because though we can't tell how intelligent a foetus will be, we do know if it will be malformed. So simply get rid of it and try again, there is every chance the next healthy foetus will be just as intelligent once brought to full term and allowed to grow.

It is. A healthy child is entitled to the healthcare, a parents decides whether to have a healthy child or not. The decision is their's alone, the system is in place and they are in full knowledge of the facts. The child is merely facing the consequences of the parents decision. And I fail to see what is courageous about bringing a dmagaed child into the world, it is sentiment, not courage. I'd argue the inverse is more courageous, trying for a healthy child in the face of adversity. Equally, far more courageous would be for the people who cannot have a healthy child, far more courageous would be to adopt, rather than bring a damaged child into the world simply so that they have their 'own'.

Only to an extent. Hence the one treatment a year. Everyone pays into the system so that they can be helped in times of need, not wanton irresponsibility. These people have been helped of an aiolment that is entirely their own fault once alreayd this year, at the expense of the tax payer. They've been told what precautions to take and what will happen if they present again, they do anyway (within a year) that is their choice and their reponsibility. Clearly they have been wanton once again and ignored the advice, twice within a year. Now it is their problem, and they must pay as they've taken more than their fair share. And the level of tolerance would not change for anyone, 1 STD treatment per year.

As I've said before, I view sport differently to STD's or drug use, obesity etc. I've clarfied my position already.

Eugh. It's a bit of self-respect, a bit of pride and a bit of responsibility. Noone, barring those with a diagnosed medical condition, has an excuse for being obese. You can't use will power as an excuse. Otherwise, hell, it must be fine for some people not to work? They just don't have the will power to turn up you see. And we should get rid of all qualifications right? Because it's not fair to judge someone because they have less will power. It's a non-argument. If you're fat and it's your fault, then you do something about it, don't make excuses.

It would if I had my way.

Oh no, they should be taken. Some of them anyway. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not talking fundamentals here. But the ones that have been ruled on by the courts of late. We should be allowed to force criminals to work, deport foreign criminals, even if there's a chance they'll be in danger in their country of origin etc. If you prove you cannot respect other peoples' Human Rights, if you prove you cannot live in society, then why should you be treated by the same standards as them?

Not sure where you get that from? I'm talking from a national perspective here, let's be clear.

Ahh, but that's the beauty of it, if they die, they die. And bang goes the burden. STD treatments? How dangerous will they get? And if you're a drastically obese man with heart disease then you're welcome to waddle off to the black market, you'll hear no complaint from me.
 
 
 
Now, let me me make it clear to you that I am definately NOT a racist. I don't judge people by their race, only by actions of individuals. ANY racist hate-filled comment on this thread WILL MORE THAN DEFINATELY be deleted. I'm aware that this is a taboo subject to talk about, so if you're black, please don't get offended. I didn't make this thread in an attempt to offend people, and spread hate.I know crime happens amongst all races, and I made this thread to find out why it's bigger in the black community. I also have quite a few black friends who are also concerned about this issue, so that's another reason not to take offence.

I live in south London, and I just read an article about Black people and crime on MailOnline, and that the figures released by the met police show that black men commit most of the crime in London.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...--victims.html 

My own experiences

I've never actually been successfully robbed, but pretty much all of the people who attemped to rob me (at school) happened to be black. Everytime somebody was aggressive towards me during school they almost always hapened to be black.

There was one black person in my class who didn't bring any equipment with him, so he asked me if i could lend him some equipment. I knew he had a reputation for 'borrowing' equipment and then not returning it back. Initially I said "no", because I was worried he won't return it back. Then he came up to me in an aggressive stance, and threatened to punch me and then take my compass...so I just had no choice but to give it to him. At the end of the lesson I asked for it back, he didn't give it straight away, and he put my compass in his bottom and rubbed it...then put it it in my hands?? Seriously??

I remember standing in the line while waiting for lunch at lunchtime at school, and this group of black students just barged in front of me. When I politely told them that I was there first, one of the black students gave me an EXTREMELY hard punch, and left my arm stinging for a while... There are endless cases which I can talk about, but I'd be here all day.

My mother has only been robbed twice, and on both occassions it involved black youths. When my mother first came into this country from South-Asia about 21 years ago, a group of black youths in Streatham approached her while she was in my Father's car. They asked her if she had any tissue, so she gave them some tissue, and then one of them grabbed her gold necklace and ran off with it. 3 years ago my Mother was at a checkpoint about to withdraw some cash, and a black youth behind her must have been looking at her pin, and she wasn't aware than the youth was behind her as half her attention was on my baby sister. Then more black youths came and told her to hurry up, and kept her distracted while another one took my Mum's credit card and ran off with it, and they knew my Mum's pin and took about Â£200. And yes, my mum did report this to the police, but they never managed to trace the boys down.

This experience is by far the most shocking experience I've had. In 2007 when I was in year 8, I was walking with two friends down tooting in South London, and a group of black teenagers approached us. They didn't go for me, but the went for my other friend. They asked him for a pound or they would take his phone. He didn't have a pound, but he begged and pleaded with them not to take his phone. After a bit of a struggle while they grabbed him, one of the black teenagers flicked hot ash from his cigarrete he was smoking into his eyes, then ran off with his school tie and phone. The police picked up the boy who was robbed and drived around to look for the boys who robbed him, but never found them.

My question is, why is crime in the black community significantly higher than other communities? And (from my experience), why some black people are a bit more aggressive than the aggressive people in other races?

Not sure how much truth the articles contains but it's worth a look
 
 
 
Maybe because bad areas have the highest crime rates, and there are a lot of black people in bad areas. Conversely, black people in middle class areas are greatly under-represented in crime statistics. I'd definitely put it down to environment. It's worth noting that the same goes for other races.

Give bad areas better post-education opportunities and better education, and I'm sure crime rates there would eventually drop.

You're seriously saying that you haven't noticed that all the stories you hear of involving black people and crime (including other ethnic minorities) usually come from a bad area, usually somewhere in London. When crime stories are reported on other white people however, you'd notice that it ranges among the classes from similar crimes from people from deprived area to sexual harassment of an employee, fraud, and hacking in the middle class.

Anyway you'll notice with most crimes that the common factor is living in a deprived area and not race. It just so happens that a lot of black people live in deprived areas.

I'll also add that I live in a middle class area and go to a predominantly middle class school, and it isn't the black people committing the crimes. From what I've seen of middle class black people, they're no more likely to commit crime than a middle class white person.

Anyway, why question what I said? Do you just think that all black people commit crime? I don't want to jump to conclusions before I hear your response.

The numbers refer to each of your paragraphs:

1. It's not a proper study, also ask yourself why the Jews the Asians and the Indians can all "work themselves out of the the Ghetto" whilst the blacks just don't

2. I agree poor people do more crime, but why are a dispraportionately high level of blacks poor?

3. Middle class area? Middle class school? Let me guess black people are underrepresented.

4. It is possibly genetic whilst all races have the potential to create "geniuses" ice age, africa favoured a strong (Could fight for women) virile man who could impregnate many women who would be able to easily get food without him. Whereas ice age Europe/Asia(Especially) favoured a man who knew how to build good shelters, could farm and knew which food to eat during the summer months and which to keep for winter(Keep the ones which don't perish so easily). Furthermore in this part of the world men who stuck with their women (To provide food) where more likely to keep their young alive as, whereas the caveman "players" didn't do so well as their kids would have been more likely to die due to the harsh conditions.
A slightly more esoteric theory (These are only theories afterall), which I have come up with is lead poisoning (Bear with me). Poor people(Black people especially I believe) are statistically more likely to have higher levels of the heavy metal due to living in poorly maintained, older housing (The projects) as well as suffer from poor nutrition. The condition has been documented to decrease IQ, increase aggressive and impulsive behaviour, especially sexual aggressiveness, but who knows?
The problem is that it seems that the West's balls have just dropped off and no one with a good reputation has the guts to conduct a serious study(Apart from racalists racists, but I said good reputation) so until China (Let's face it, it's gonna be them) do some kind of genetic study to determine whether or not, it is due to genes or environment or both, we shall never know and the problems will continue.
 
 
 
They're hardly going to say the opposite to anyone though, are they? You and I both know the sort of judgement they'd recieve. And we're talking in terms of people.

So simply get rid of it and try again, there is every chance the next healthy foetus will be just as intelligent once brought to full term and allowed to grow.

 

Well we can only go off what people say but hang on, if you know the judgement they'd receive, then surely you know what I'm thinking of you right now and where I'm coming from by disagreeing with you? And yes we can't know for sure, but the point is to argue that a physical disability makes you inferior is null. I know plenty of physically sound people who are dense as s***, and the likelihood is their kids will be too.

 
It is. A healthy child is entitled to the healthcare, a parents decides whether to have a healthy child or not. The decision is their's alone, the system is in place and they are in full knowledge of the facts. The child is merely facing the consequences of the parents decision. And I fail to see what is courageous about bringing a dmagaed child into the world, it is sentiment, not courage. I'd argue the inverse is more courageous, trying for a healthy child in the face of adversity. Equally, far more courageous would be for the people who cannot have a healthy child, far more courageous would be to adopt, rather than bring a damaged child into the world simply so that they have their 'own'.

 

Well it's not "their" decision anyway since they're being coerced into it but does it seem fair to you that a child should pay the consequences, for a decision it didn't make, for the rest of its life?

And it's courageous because they are not superficial about the situation. They know physical capability is not the be all and end all. Even if the child didn't have a genetic problem, he could still very easily end up physically disabled (starved of oxygen through various means, dropped, hell he could even be hit by a car...no one knows).

 
Only to an extent. Hence the one treatment a year. Everyone pays into the system so that they can be helped in times of need, not wanton irresponsibility. These people have been helped of an aiolment that is entirely their own fault once alreayd this year, at the expense of the tax payer. They've been told what precautions to take and what will happen if they present again, they do anyway (within a year) that is their choice and their reponsibility. Clearly they have been wanton once again and ignored the advice, twice within a year. Now it is their problem, and they must pay as they've taken more than their fair share. And the level of tolerance would not change for anyone, 1 STD treatment per year.

 

Well it's pointless me arguing against this because it's your opinion. But I can assure you that no one would stand for this, and especially not the medical council. It just goes against everything that people pay tax for, and everything that our health system was established for. Anyone should be entitled to treatment, anytime, without hassle to improve their quality of life.

 
As I've said before, I view sport differently to STD's or drug use, obesity etc. I've clarfied my position already.

 

But why is it different? Sports players are addicted to the fun of their sport and to adrenaline (hence the term adrenaline junkie).

 
Eugh. It's a bit of self-respect, a bit of pride and a bit of responsibility. Noone, barring those with a diagnosed medical condition, has an excuse for being obese. You can't use will power as an excuse. Otherwise, hell, it must be fine for some people not to work? They just don't have the will power to turn up you see. And we should get rid of all qualifications right? Because it's not fair to judge someone because they have less will power. It's a non-argument. If you're fat and it's your fault, then you do something about it, don't make excuses.

 

Again this is your opinion so it's pointless arguing about it. The whole medical establishment is there to provide care to anyone, because we have reached a whole new stage in our medical conduct - it's called hollistic medicine. Doctors are taught to look at every aspect of a person's life to determine the cause of their condition. And I know that with obesity it is hardly ever black and white. Someone may develop an eating disorder because they've lost a loved one, lost their job, they're getting bullied, they're in a general rough spot, etc. And as I've said, obesity is heavily linked to genetics.

 
It would if I had my way.

 

Again...thank god it's not your way   You know, I think the population of this society of yours would be 1  

 
Oh no, they should be taken. Some of them anyway. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not talking fundamentals here. But the ones that have been ruled on by the courts of late. We should be allowed to force criminals to work, deport foreign criminals, even if there's a chance they'll be in danger in their country of origin etc. If you prove you cannot respect other peoples' Human Rights, if you prove you cannot live in society, then why should you be treated by the same standards as them?

 

Because society cannot operate under an eye for an eye policy? And again, you're sentencing people to death. There's a reason why we don't do that.

 
Not sure where you get that from? I'm talking from a national perspective here, let's be clear.

 

But if it's such a good system then why can it not be applied globally? Surely the same constraints that restrict you from establishing it worldwide apply in the UK.

 
Ahh, but that's the beauty of it, if they die, they die. And bang goes the burden. STD treatments? How dangerous will they get? And if you're a drastically obese man with heart disease then you're welcome to waddle off to the black market, you'll hear no complaint from me.

 

I'm too altruistic to think like that, which is why I'm doing Medicine I guess, and which is why if something like what you've proposed was ever put in place, I'd **** the hell off outta here.
 
 
 
Well we can only go off what people say but hang on, if you know the judgement they'd receive, then surely you know what I'm thinking of you right now and where I'm coming from by disagreeing with you? And yes we can't know for sure, but the point is to argue that a physical disability makes you inferior is null. I know plenty of physically sound people who are dense as s***, and the likelihood is their kids will be too.

Well it's not &quot;their&quot; decision anyway since they're being coerced into it but does it seem fair to you that a child should pay the consequences, for a decision it didn't make, for the rest of its life?

And it's courageous because they are not superficial about the situation. They know physical capability is not the be all and end all. Even if the child didn't have a genetic problem, he could still very easily end up physically disabled (starved of oxygen through various means, dropped, hell he could even be hit by a car...no one knows).

Well it's pointless me arguing against this because it's your opinion. But I can assure you that no one would stand for this, and especially not the medical council. It just goes against everything that people pay tax for, and everything that our health system was established for. Anyone should be entitled to treatment, anytime, without hassle to improve their quality of life.

But why is it different? Sports players are addicted to the fun of their sport and to adrenaline (hence the term adrenaline junkie).

Again this is your opinion so it's pointless arguing about it. The whole medical establishment is there to provide care to anyone, because we have reached a whole new stage in our medical conduct - it's called hollistic medicine. Doctors are taught to look at every aspect of a person's life to determine the cause of their condition. And I know that with obesity it is hardly ever black and white.

Equally the likelhood is that those thick as **** people will fill a gap in productive society. The person with severe physical deformation will contirbute less than someone with the same attributes but full bodily function every time. The stigma is around knowingly bringing a deformed child into the world. You judge the parents for their selfish decision, I guess you acknowledge that the child will be a burden, but it's not your burden to bear, it is the parents'. As such I would not treat the child any differently, as I know the buck is not being passed. And neither I hope, would anyone else.

Yes. It will only take a few generations for the practice of having such children to die out, and those that are born are a sacrifice for the greater good, in terms of their quality of life. You look after them and you perpetuate the cycle, to the detriment of everyone. Oh they could, but they are not certain to be broken. And such incidents during birth aren't likely.

Well mayhaps. But eugh, it's an issue of personal quality of life verses societal quality of life. By being selfish, by doing wholly avoidable things for quick pleasures, i.e STD's, you are causing a detriment to society. You are given the benifit of the doubt once, accidents happen etc. But the second time? Clearly that is on you, in my view anyway. Anyway, I thought you said you thought STD's were a problem? Do you not agree that such methods would be an incentive to better practice safe sex?

Well for one junkies are those that do extreme sport, not normal sport. And I'll try and clarify again. Obeseity, Drug abuse, these are habits over years through which you will see a slow decline, with certain health complications as an outcome. These complications are wholly avoidable because this is a choice that takes place over a matter of years. Equally, there is no benifit to obesity or drug addiction. Sport on the other hand carries a 'chance' of injury, not a certaintity. It is different. Plus sport has many positive effects, such as fitness, teambuilding and entertainment.

Uh-huh. I have overweight parents, they don;t all that badly, and don't do no excersise. I daresay this may indicate I'm in some sort of genetic group. And yet I am not even overweight. As I've said, I reject your idea of excusing such things on a basis of will power. You don't do a job because you want to, you do one because you have to. The same would be true of staying healthy. It would no longer be an option, but a requirement.

You say that now. I don't think so   Although if there were only like minded people in it we would progress much faster  

I didn't say an eye for an eye. No, I'm not sentancing them to death. They came hear fleeing some percieved opression, we had the good grace to allow them to stay, they threw that back in our faces. well then, you go back where you started, we have no obligation to you. I'm not advocating raping rapists or anything, simply that certain 'Human Rights' make life for a criminal easy, and prisons unproductive, and our judiciary system little deterrent for criminals.

Well that's you I guess. You be Altruistic, I'll look out for myself and mine.

Well the fundamental point here is that you think the parents are "selfish", whereas I think otherwise.

You look after them and you perpetuate the cycle, to the detriment of everyone. Oh they could, but they are not certain to be broken. And such incidents during birth aren't likely.

 

That's a rather idealistic approach seeing as we both know this idea of yours would never be established in the first place. But if it were, then the only reason is because of blackmail rather than what people would like. That is not a democracy.

Do you not agree that such methods would be an incentive to better practice safe sex?

 

Oh yes, of course...but at what cost? When it comes to medicine no one should be coerced into making a decision and the strength of my belief in that ideal outweighs the benefits your society proposes. We will undoubtedly find other ways around it as we progress.

Sport on the other hand carries a 'chance' of injury, not a certaintity. It is different. Plus sport has many positive effects, such as fitness, teambuilding and entertainment.

 

But there are far safer ways to get fit, to entertain yourself (which btw obese people and drug abusers probably also get from food and drugs - entertainment), and to engage in team exercises. And smoking, drinking, etc does by no means guarantee you'll develop a condition, so it's rather similar to sport.

 
Uh-huh. I have overweight parents, they don;t all that badly, and don't do no excersise. I daresay this may indicate I'm in some sort of genetic group. And yet I am not even overweight.

It would no longer be an option, but a requirement.

 

Your family is not representative of the entire population of obese people though. And, unless it's due to a disease which is rare, there's no other cause of obesity except will power (mixed with genetics to determine the extent). Therefore it is a doctor's job to determine the factors affecting that will power.

The way current medicine works is a little bit similar to the way you're suggesting, though your version is much more drastic. At the moment if someone needs a hip replacement, due to obesity, it is down to the local Trust to offer it to them. If the Trust doesn't offer it, the patient cannot receive it, he cannot demand it (though he can have the judgement overruled by a court in some cases). The Trust needs to weigh up the cost of the hip replacement in comparison to the risks associated and the likelihood of success. It is highly probable that the Trust will not offer the replacement unless the patient can lose weight. Now that is not because they want to punish the patient, it is because they know that if the patient doesn't lose weight, the replacement will fail and that can lead to more complications. Just a fun story I thought I'd share.

 
You say that now. I don't think so   Although if there were only like minded people in it we would progress much faster  

 

True but what are the odds of that? You're the first person I've met who believes the things you do. Consider yourself unique on some level, though I can't say that's a good thing in this case  

 
I didn't say an eye for an eye. No, I'm not sentancing them to death. They came hear fleeing some percieved opression, we had the good grace to allow them to stay, they threw that back in our faces. well then, you go back where you started, we have no obligation to you.

"If you prove you cannot respect other peoples' Human Rights, if you prove you cannot live in society, then why should you be treated by the same standards as them?"

I don't know how else to interpret that if not an eye for an eye. But that is a death sentence, because you know when you send them back they'll get killed; it is no different to sentencing them to death at your own hands. I presume they stand trial?

 
Well that's you I guess. You be Altruistic, I'll look out for myself and mine.

 

I guess so then. I don't think our beliefs (on any topic) could be any more the opposite.
 
 
Some of those that are in forces, are the same that burn crosses?
 
 
 
Well the fundamental point here is that you think the parents are &quot;selfish&quot;, whereas I think otherwise.

You seem to misunderstand democracy. It is the rule of the majority. If the majority support it, then it actually is democracy in action. But I never said my perfect world would be a democracy  

Your beliefs are different to mine. I hold mine to be more benificial to society. In such a society, self worth, responsibility, pride etc would be virtues that are reinstilled, rather than what we have today. Where every problem is passed and blame shifted.

Drinking will always damage your liver, if it's excessive, which is what I said. Smoking to any extent damages your lungs and clogs up your blood with CO. Along with all the cancer casuing particles. As I've said, I view sport as a good thing, it has many benifits. Alcohol abuse, drug abuse, food abuse, they have no benifits.

No, will power is not a factor to be taken into consideration by the doctor. Genetics? Maybe, disorder? Certainly? Will power? No. Because it's subjective, and subject to massive change. I think you'll find that if someone needs to lose weight to get their cancer treated, they might just suddenly find they have a whole lot of will power. If not, then they're toast. And not toast covered in butter and jam like they're used to  

And I don't think that is severe enough. Although it's a step in the right direction, and yes, I was aware such things happen.

No, no I'm not. I'm the first to voice them. I daresay there are other people with similar views, maybe not quite as extreme, but certainly down the same lines. Many are just too afraid to air them in public, for fear of judgement.

An eye for an eye would be killing them. This is simply revoking their right to be in your country, if that means they possibley die, then too bad. I'm not klilling them, clearly they did something to peeve their government or other people back home. Perhaps they should have thought of that before. But that would be the minority of cases anyway, for the most part it would be forcing labour and so on. Making the Prison population pay for itself if you can, if not, then making prison a much grimer deterrent.

I don't know.

Do you like Mountain Dew?

There has been a massive amount of immigration from African and Carribean countries.

 

There hasnât. The black population is 1.9%.

 
If a certain type of person is more likely to commit crime then people of that type should be searched more in regards to the relavent crime! If it's trans-atlantic terrorism, then yeah, stop Arabs and distinctly Muslim men more. If it's gang, drug or violent offenses related in the inner city, stop black youths more. If that's what gets results. To say otherwise is to show your clear insecurity and over sensative nature. If my profile makes me more likely to commit a certain crime then I'll not begruddge the Police having more suspicion on me. It's common bloomin' sense.

 

Itâs funny people like you who seek to now justify profiling of Arabs or Muslims since September 11 were hardly clamouring for the same treatment of white males in the wake of Oklahoma City in the USA or the same treatment white men in the UK for the nail bombs that went off in Brixton 7 years ago by some white supremacist. Plus Al-Qaeda operates in 64 countries and many of them non-Arab, and don't look like the image you have of a terrorist. Police don't randomly stop and search people in the hopes of turning up last night's off licence robber. They have more specific information to go on in those cases. So I assume, that you think that the police should spends three days stopping black people and hope they get lucky.

Also I notice the way you conveniently ignored the point I made before. In that you are selective in terms of the kinds of racial profiling you support. Although whites are a disproportionate percentage of all drunk drivers and although drunk driving contributes to the deaths of around 450 people each year (More than 1 day), you wonât suggest drunk driving roadblocks be set up in white areas where the âhit ratesâ for catching violators would be highest. Likewise, though white uni students are considerably more likely to binge drink (often underage) and use drugs than black college students, no one suggests that police or campus cops should regularly stage raids on white college campuses or dorm rooms occupied by whites, even though the raw data would suggest such actions might be statistically justified. Whites are also nearly twice as likely to engage in child sexual molestation, relative to blacks. Yet how would the world react to an announcement that adoption agencies were going to begin screening out white couples seeking to adopt, or subjecting them to extra scrutiny, as a result of such factual information ?

Also if you thought of crime as any behaviours that result in unnecessary death, injury and illness (like the manufacturing of faulty consumer products, as well as corporate pollution, which contributes to occupational disease and death at three times the rate of murders), then the answer would be no. But you donât think of it that way, so you stay focused on the violence of the black and poor, over that of the white and wealthy. Come to think of it, you donât even focus your attentions on your fellow white brothers around Europe who cause far more damage have a far bigger impact than any black street criminal. Again as I said to you before, your white brothers, those white Russian mafia gangs and the powerful vory v zakone brotherhood are almost exclusively white, though some Uzbeks and other ethnic minorities are presented among their ranks. Italian organized crime is exclusive: Neapolitan camorra. European organized crime in general is white and forms a underworld web that beats black street gangs easily in power, prestige and money. Turkish Babas and organizations are exclusive white.

In France there are strong Algerian immigrant gangs and organizations but the upper echelon of French organizations are white. Very few black criminals have risen to the top there or in Britain despite numerous black criminals in those countries. Indian criminal networks and crime groups are also exclusive, meaning they do not accept blacks among the rank and file, not to mention in the leadership positions.

Now how this effects on people in the UK and their safety ?

These real organized crime groups are responsible for the flow of drugs into UK and Europe but they are white. Then, there are the stockbroker jugglers, into bonds and securities who are also organized criminals and who are the main reason why the average whites in the UK are in the deep S**T, lose their homes, insurances, get laid off from work. They affect the real security of white brits many many times more than any black street mugger or dope smoking gang-banger. They look respectable (2 u..not me) so you will walk past them in the street and no give them a thought. They are also serious players in the financial fraud scene. They smuggle weapons and supply the street criminals with weapons and drugs. And of course, they are the ones who operate together with corrupt officials and politicians. This has been documented for decades by now. They smuggle illegal DVDS, tobacco, are involved in the sex trade, identity fraud, benefit fraud. You name they are in it. You don't know anything. You don't the economics of this real big crime. Yet you DARE come in here, with all your positions and postures and your silly views.

As white people, you've been lulled into thinking it's safe to be around other white people. Yet if you look back on your life, a strange but unmistakable pattern seems to emerge. Every person who has ever harmed you in your lifetime has been white. You've never been attacked by a black person You've never been evicted by a black person You've never had a black landlord You've never had a black person deny you a bank loan And you've never heard a black person say, "We're going to eliminate ten thousand jobs here-have a nice day!" Every mean word, every cruel act, every bit of pain and suffering in your life has had a white face attached to it.

So, why is it exactly that you should be afraid of black people ?

 
You want to explain everything away with racism, rather than objective fact. So you are telling me that every Police officer, Judge, Parole Officer, Prison Officer etc is a racist? There's all some big British conspiracy to keep the Black man down?

 

Debating with you is like fighting Zombies, no matter how many you smack down they just keep coming. Thereâs an old adage that numbers can be made to say anything one chooses; and while this is not exactly trueâafter all, one canât make 2+2=5âit is certainly the case that data often gets manipulated in order to advance a particular argument. If intellectual gymnastics were an Olympic sport, I swaer, white people would be the team to beat you go to amazing lengths to convince yourself that your wish to steer clear of blacks in the cities isnât the least bit racist. Truth be told, racists have always found excuses for their prejudices, and not surprisingly, they have usually involved the fear of black crime. Yet, all would have sworn they werenât racists. They were just being ârealistic.â After all, âthose peopleâ really do have higher crime rates, donât they ?

You have a childlike trust in what those in power tell you. You can talk about crime data and crime facts all day and then you pretend you are oblivious to the fact most of the government studies have been carried out by white people and therefore carry inherent biases. The very capacity to conduct studies, collect data and write detached âfact-basedâ reports on it, and then get this broadcast on all media forms and taken seriously is an inherently white privileged activity. The ability to widely access this material and research it exhaustively is also inherently white privileged and so once again the system of racism works like petrol to a car because white people possess this privilege.

I donât think it is an outrageous to suggest that white people who have started a fire in every black brown country on the planet. Who have committed the greatest racist crimes on Earth. Who have killed the Indians, killed the blacks, used biological ware fare for population control in Africa, killed various animal life to near extinction, consumed and stolen natural resources from other countries, imposed their will on every other race in the world, ravaged the Earth like a disease, even commit horrendous crimes against yourselves. Given this history, I donât think itâs an outrageous claim to say to that police officers, Judges, Parole Officers, Prison Officers are all in a big British conspiracy to keep the Black man down.

Funny thing is your probably the type of person who normally distrusts anything the government tell you but on the crime issue you cite them as the definitive source for understanding crime, and who commits it, seems a bit disingenuous to say the least. I know your trying SO-SO HARD to be serious and give statistical arguments on race. While it might be funny to laugh at you. I also realize that people like you exist, who deny reality to such a degree as to ignore reality slapping you in the face. Still, you seem positive that your untrained theories are ABSOLUTELY on the money, and that everyone else who disagrees with you have all been compromised by political correctness.

 
It's really rather their fault if they get caught for actually committing a crime. You never seem to acknowledge that these people actually are criminals, all you want is for them to be victims of racism. And yeah, most violent crime isn't committed by Whites.

 

Again your straw manning. I never said that they werenât criminals. I think you need to inspect your house before you try to inspect others. I hate to tell you this but itâs not black people who have made this planet the pitiful war torn hate filled placed it is to inhabit. You name the problem, the disease, the human suffering, or the abject misery visited upon millions, and Iâll bet you tenner I can put a white face on it faster than you can name the members of Spice Girls.
 
 
because these black youths "rep" postcodes. I dont know why there like that i suppose it because they are trying to emulate bloods and crips.

Thereâs an old adage that numbers can be made to say anything one chooses; and while this is not exactly trueâafter all, one canât make 2+2=5âit is certainly the case that data often gets manipulated in order to advance a particular argument. If intellectual gymnastics were an Olympic sport, I swaer, white people would be the team to beat you go to amazing lengths to convince yourself that your wish to steer clear of blacks in the cities isnât the least bit racist. Truth be told, racists have always found excuses for their prejudices, and not surprisingly, they have usually involved the fear of black crime. Yet, all would have sworn they werenât racists. They were just being ârealistic.â After all, âthose peopleâ really do have higher crime rates, donât they ?

You have a childlike trust in what those in power tell you. You can talk about crime data and crime facts all day and then you pretend you are oblivious to the fact most of the government studies have been carried out by white people and therefore carry inherent biases. The very capacity to conduct studies, collect data and write detached âfact-basedâ reports on it, and then get this broadcast on all media forms and taken seriously is an inherently white privileged activity. The ability to widely access this material and research it exhaustively is also inherently white privileged and so once again the system of racism works like petrol to a car because white people possess this privilege.

I donât think it is an outrageous to suggest that white people who have started a fire in every black brown country on the planet. Who have committed the greatest racist crimes on Earth. Who have killed the Indians, killed the blacks, used biological ware fare for population control in Africa, killed various animal life to near extinction, consumed and stolen natural resources from other countries, imposed their will on every other race in the world, ravaged the Earth like a disease, even commit horrendous crimes against yourselves. Given this history, I donât think itâs an outrageous claim to say to that police officers, Judges, Parole Officers, Prison Officers are all in a big British conspiracy to keep the Black man down.

Funny thing is your probably the type of person who normally distrusts anything the government tell you but on the crime issue you cite them as the definitive source for understanding crime, and who commits it, seems a bit disingenuous to say the least. I know your trying SO-SO HARD to be serious and give statistical arguments on race. While it might be funny to laugh at you. I also realize that people like you exist, who deny reality to such a degree as to ignore reality slapping you in the face. Still, you seem positive that your untrained theories are ABSOLUTELY on the money, and that everyone else who disagrees with you have all been compromised by political correctness.

Again your straw manning. I never said that they werenât criminals. I think you need to inspect your house before you try to inspect others. I hate to tell you this but itâs not black people who have made this planet the pitiful war torn hate filled placed it is to inhabit. You name the problem, the disease, the human suffering, or the abject misery visited upon millions, and Iâll bet you tenner I can put a white face on it faster than you can name the members of Spice Girls.

 

Wrong. The Black population as 2.0% in 2001 and was growing at a faster rate than the Ethnically White English race.

 

White people would have alreayd been the majority stopped for such a thing. When a mminority is responsible for a hugley disproportionate amount of crime, then such obvious racial profiling is certinaly acceptable. SUch as the amount of crime commited by black men in the city, or Arabs as regards trans-atlantic areonautical terrorism.

Please provide your source for your statistic on Drink driving. Plus the two are incomparable. White drivers will be the majority stopped. And drink driving crime happens on raods, by definition not in certain areas with a concentration of those people.

Again, I'd love to see where you are getting your statistics from. And equally, thr problem is not with overall crime rate, but ethnic representation within the criminal system. Of course there will be more White students guilty of such crimes being as there are far more white students. So yeah, I'd love to see what stats you're basing this off. And I don;t mean just write a number. A link to the source is required. All of my states are coming from statistics.org.gov and I'll be happy to link them.

And yeah, again, a stupid comparison. Tell me, how many people who have adopted molest their children? And no doubt more White people are under suspicion for such activity, although Pakistani's seem to be rather proflific lately too  

And what's that point supposed to mean? Criminals are racist?

Eugh. And as I've been through before, it's not as simple as clicking your fingers and arresting the people at the top of the food chain, if it was we'd do it you know.  

Have been attacked by a black person actually  

But it would be odd for me to have all those things happen to me seeing as I live in a rural area where I've only ever known aroun 10 black people. Stop trying to make me seem like I'm saying black poeople are predisposed to commit crime. I have celarly said that is not my view many times. But what is undeniable is that inner city black youths commit a disproportionate amount of crime.

Ha! I've heard Diane Abbot say such things actually! Why I've heard Diane Abbot be a despoicable racist. The thing is though, you make all these claims and one can;t help bt notice there are far less Blacks in these positions. Indicative of societies racism? Nay, I think not. I'd say it's because the majority of black people live in a certain way and the way they live perpetuates that. Don't blame me for that.

I do rather love how you presume to know me. Fatc is I don;t just avoid Blacks in those areas, I avoid Blacks, Asians and shock horror, Whites. They all have rather tell tale signs about them you see. So nay, I'm not a racist for avoiding a mostly black area, I'm a realist for avoiding a crime riddden area. Just as I avoid certain White populated streets of my home town at certain times. But hey, I guess I'm still just a dang racist eh? If I don;t hug every black guy I see.  

Oh my god! You actually just admitted you think there is a conspiracy involving every Juror, Judge, Policeman etc in the whole of Britain to keep the black man down?

Oh my. Oh dear.

And you see, there is a reason for that. White culture has for most of History been far superior to any black culture. Speaking from almost every avenue of civilisation. Hell, every culture and civlilisation has been superior to black culture. That's not racism, that's damn Truth. The Arabs were, The Europeans always have been. And there are a variety of topographical, geogrphical, socioeconomic reasons for all of this. But it is undeniable fact. Now, with that fact in mind it is no wonder that so many races have been sugjigated under White people. It has been the way of the world for a long time, the srtong control the weak. Blacks did it within their own societies too, it is not a White phenomena.

Not even sure what to make of that? You're right I suppose, using statistics as part of an argument? What the hell am I doing hey? A much better basis for an argument is heresay and resentment, just like you model. Obviously far superior. Why on earth would anyone want you to show a basis for your claims eh? Bet that's racist  

Pffff  

I see, inner city youths commit crime because of the state of the planet. Of course. Not because they want that iPod, but as a stand against European cultural dominance and Imperilaism throughout the ages  
 
 
 
You seem to misunderstand democracy. It is the rule of the majority. If the majority support it, then it actually is democracy in action. But I never said my perfect world would be a democracy  

 

Oh god! Not even a democracy? I told you we can't agree on anything. But I wouldn't call it majority support if the only reason they're agreeing is because they've been blackmailed into it, whether you'd still call that a democracy or not.

 
Your beliefs are different to mine. I hold mine to be more benificial to society. In such a society, self worth, responsibility, pride etc would be virtues that are reinstilled, rather than what we have today. Where every problem is passed and blame shifted.

 

But I've already called you on many aspects of your society that aren't beneficial. I believe that the negatives of your society far outweigh any benefits, for the reasons that I've mentioned in all my previous posts.

 
Drinking will always damage your liver, if it's excessive, which is what I said. Smoking to any extent damages your lungs and clogs up your blood with CO. Along with all the cancer casuing particles. As I've said, I view sport as a good thing, it has many benifits. Alcohol abuse, drug abuse, food abuse, they have no benifits.

 

Actually that's not true. All humans are not identical. Different people's organs have different tolerances, what's excessive for one person may not be for another. Therefore you cannot say with certainty that smoking will lead to cancer in ALL cases, or that drinking will lead to liver disease in ALL cases, etc. If you cannot say that then you cannot say it is not like sport. In both cases there is a chance you'll injure yourself and end up in hospital. And many people would say there are benefits: entertainment, blending in with a social group, the feeling of getting high, etc. You don't see the benefits because there aren't any for you.

 
No, will power is not a factor to be taken into consideration by the doctor. Genetics? Maybe, disorder? Certainly? Will power? No. Because it's subjective, and subject to massive change. I think you'll find that if someone needs to lose weight to get their cancer treated, they might just suddenly find they have a whole lot of will power. If not, then they're toast. And not toast covered in butter and jam like they're used to  

 

Don't think you've quite grasped how the medical profession works. Will power is subjective, it is unique to every person, and I've already explained that the UK practices hollistic medicine which looks at each case as unique. If someone goes to a doctor with obesity they don't ask "is it in your genes?", they ask "why aren't you losing weight?". That is down to each and every person's will. And the cancer analogy is correct; that is an example of helping someone address their individual issue of will. For different people different methods will be required.

 
And I don't think that is severe enough. Although it's a step in the right direction, and yes, I was aware such things happen.

 

I can't see it going beyond that in all honesty as there's already plenty of cases where decisions have been overturned by the court.

 
An eye for an eye would be killing them. This is simply revoking their right to be in your country, if that means they possibley die, then too bad. I'm not klilling them, clearly they did something to peeve their government or other people back home. Perhaps they should have thought of that before. But that would be the minority of cases anyway, for the most part it would be forcing labour and so on. Making the Prison population pay for itself if you can, if not, then making prison a much grimer deterrent.

 

Ugh, all I have to say. But it is an eye for an eye because they turn their backs on your rights, you turn yours on their rights.

 
I don't know.

Do you like Mountain Dew?

 

Meh? Can't say I'm a huge fan of fizzy drinks   Didn't know Mountain Dew was in the UK anyway, I normally only drink it when I go to America

Oh, there'd be a type of democracy, but I worry you wouldn't call it such. To my mind it's democracy, just not with universal suffrage.

Your percieved downsides. Most of the downsides you mention don't seem like downsides to me.

Smoking will always lead to health complications, not always cancer or bronchitis, but less oxygen in the blood, tar in the lungs etc. Alcohol will always damage organs when consumed to an excessive extent. Which is where the problem lies. And yes, I can. I've made it clear why I think there are key differences. For one, you can name no benifits to smoking or alcohol abuse, whereas you can with sport. And that's not the only thing, I;ve explained it before.

I disagree. We can all have similar levels of will power. And saying someone doesn;t have will power then they should be excused is fundamentally wrong in my opinion. I grasp how it works now, that's not how I wish it to work.

Bloomin' 'Human Rights' bollox  

Not all of their rights though. They are just busted down a level. An acceptable level. An eye for an eye insinuates punishment that is similar to the crime, that's not what I advocate. I advocate prison. But within prison these criminals should be made to be productive. Currently that is not allowed due to 'Human Rights', I don;t think criminals deserve these rights.

Ohh. How about cheese toasties?
 
 
 
Oh, there'd be a type of democracy, but I worry you wouldn't call it such. To my mind it's democracy, just not with universal suffrage.

 

How's that a democracy then?

"In both the UK and USA any citizen, be they male or female, black or white, has the right to vote in elections, as long as they are over eighteen years old. This universal suffrage is something that is desperately needed if a country is going to be democratic, for if some citizens are excluded from the right to vote then a government is obviously not democratic because not everyone who lives in that country is getting a chance to say how they want it to be run."

 
Your percieved downsides. Most of the downsides you mention don't seem like downsides to me.

 

Well clearly not to you because you're supporting this society so profusely, but to everyone else, especially the medical world, yes

And that's not the only thing, I;ve explained it before.

 

Doesn't necessarily mean they would need to go to hospital for it. And doing sports excessively can lead to cubital tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow or shinsplints, etc.

But I just told you what the benefits are...if there were no benefits then no one would do it obviously lol.

 
I disagree. We can all have similar levels of will power. And saying someone doesn;t have will power then they should be excused is fundamentally wrong in my opinion. I grasp how it works now, that's not how I wish it to work.

 

No one's saying that they should be excused. I'm saying that when someone goes to the doctor's, that's the issue issue that needs to be addressed.

But you said they should be sent back to their country, where they will definitely be killed. If they've committed a petty crime, then what you're doing is worse than what they did. If they killed someone then it is bang on an eye for an eye.

 
Ohh. How about cheese toasties?

 

You know what! No, lol   How about...carrot cake? My favourite type, yummy

You suppose to represent the entire medical world? What about those in private practice?

I was talking of healthy benifits. And those don't represent huge cost to the NHS.

Right.

No. They claim they may come to harm. And why would that be? Maybe they've done something wrong? Maybe they're liars? All I know is that they have abused a priviledge, and I would revoke that priviledge. I'm not killing them, I'm simply putting them back in the situation they were before I was so gracious as to grant them entry into my country.

Oh my God! We literally disagree on everything! Cheese Toasties are the best! And Carrot Cake is kinda bleh..
 
 
 
White culture has for most of History been far superior to any black culture. Speaking from almost every avenue of civilisation. Hell, every culture and civilisation has been superior to black culture. That's not racism, that's damn Truth. The Arabs were, The Europeans always have been. And there are a variety of topographical, geographical, socioeconomic reasons for all of this. But it is undeniable fact.

 

So now we finally getting into the nuts and bolts and your coming with *My gang is better than you gangâ argument. I kind of expected this and this usually happens when a white person feels backed into a corner so as a last resort, they shift gears and try and prove that his gang is the best and thus talk about so called advanced western civilisation, inventions. Firstly the thought that anyone actually can be so obtuse as to the real history and nature of white supremacy, and then confuse the outcome of white supremacy for divine blessing is pitiable to say the least. Secondly the West is currently on top, so nearly all the latest inventions and scientific breakthroughs over the last 200 years are going to be western. That is not surprising. But it says nothing about white people having any sort of special gift because if whites did, whites would have been on top for thousands of years, not just hundreds. If youâre going to focus on the 0.000000000000000000000001% of whites that have done something in the fields of science then how come the 99.9999999999999999999 of whites who have been little more than peasants for the bulk of recorded history don't represent whiteness ? But the 0.0000000000000000000001% of whites who have done things in science do ?

In 1300 you could have made the Chinese inventor argument. In 1000 BC you could have made the black Egyptian inventor argument. So called white European civilisation is not because white people are so much smarter or advanced than everyone else but because progress in science and invention is built on what has gone before. The more science you know the more science you can discover. The more inventions you have at hand, the more new inventions you can come up with. That is why the progress is exponential. It comes from the nature of science and technology, not from the nature of white intelligence. White people from Europe have been the most advanced part of mankind only twice, now and back in Greek and Roman times. Otherwise white people have been middling to backwards. Civilisations developed independently in Mexico and the Africa more complex than anything northern Europe developed independently. These Black people gave the world Maths, Physics, Chemistry, first people to build modern cities, libraries, hospitals, first people to mine. The Greeks, the first white men to become civilized, were educated and trained by black people for centuries. After the Greco/Roman Empire fell, whites went back into a culture of savagery, ignorance. This is where the black plague almost killed all of white Europe in the 13th, due to unsanitary conditions. Blacks people were directly responsible for the white boy 'renaissance' where they had to refocus on science, learning and math.

In fact going back even further in the Palolithic era, apart from spear and flute in Germany and boats in Australia. The major inventions were almost all from Africa. From 10000 to 1000 BC, the list is dominated by India ( Indus Valley ), China, Egypt and the Middle-East Mesopotamia ). Barely any European name is there. Racial discrimination led to many inventors from non-white communities to be completely disregarded and their works denied due recognition. Intellectual superiority from the north European whites is a myth. If inventions âproveâ one part of mankind is better than all the rest, then black people have a way better claim than whites.

However anglo power (British and American) is fresh in our minds, but it is merely the latest chapter in the book of history. And that is the Historical Context that you forgets. Not that this will mean much to you as your more guided by self-esteem than by facts. In order to believe that something is better than something you have to throw objectivity out the window, stomp on it, and run it over with a semi-truck, a tank, and a jumbo jet. In essence black people were the first people on earth so from the black people you got the white, red, yellow and the brown man. This is your father speaking here.

Also please reveal to me what you have invented that is beneficial to mankind ?

You Steveee......... YOU !!

Not some inventor whose accomplishments you are imputing to a whole group.

Did you design the plane ? If not, why are you taking credit for it albeit indirectly ?

Have you created any vaccine that has saved lives ?

You take credit from individuals who you have never met. You appropriate the accomplishments of a few and by implication state that it is because they are white. Funny how you don't take credit for people like Stalin and Hitler of the fact that the majority of paedophiles are white. I think part of what underlies the emotion of your argument is the experience of seeing white people in day-to-day life claim credit and get rewarded for something that a person of colour did or thought of first. Your intelligence is limited to what the people who you respect have told you.

 
Now, with that fact in mind it is no wonder that so many races have been subjugated under White people. It has been the way of the world for a long time, the strong control the weak. Blacks did it within their own societies too, it is not a White phenomena.

 

Well if your strong, then why are scared of black people ? Youâre the strong Caucasian white male arenât you ?

Why were the African armies defeated ?

SIMPLE ANSWER :

GUNPOWDER

The black man has never been defeated on the battlefield, sword with sword. During the Crusades, we fought him and beat him. He didn't have the gunpowder. Some of the leading warriors in the Muslim armies were from Africa. Indeed at the time of the first contacts with the Africans. The white northerners were but savages, greased in rancid bear fat with cow and goat butter used in their hair. The African historians mention the foul smell of them on several occasions. Not to mention that they were inept and disorganized warriors who got their heads handed to them by the African legions at every encounter. Their military strategy consisted of screaming, yelling, shouting, and charging head-on into the African archers and phalanxâa great way to end up skewered for your lack of intelligence. It was only after centuries of being defeated and later trained by Africans then fighting and trained by Romans that the UK barbarians became more efficient. But as I say African armies were only defeated when the Europeans got access to gunpowder. Marco Polo brought it back to Europe, and whites immediately started using it to kill people with. This is the differenceâthat European, whites have got something going for them that other people don't have going for them to the same extent.

WHITES LOVE TO KILL

In Africa, we kill for food. In Europe, they kill for sport. Whites get their kicks killing. I used to watch them, as a kid, when my dad used to take me to a farm in North Wales. I'd watch white people when they shoot a pheasant. When they shoot something, they just go CRAZY, like they were really getting their kicks. But they never defeated the African armies until they got gunpowder. Then with their gunpowder, they came in. In those days we had mastered the blade. You notice, today, white people have nightmares when they think a black man got a blade in his pocket because you know, that we know how to use it.

It takes a man to use a sword or blade, because you've got to have the heart to get up close to work with him and you could get stabbed yourself. But anybody can take a gun and stand at a distance and shoot at something that's no danger to him and once whites got a hold of the gun, that suited his nature; and he used it, and took over the world, with that gunpowder and his liesâI don't know which was the most effective.
 
 
Most likely due to poverty + lack of good parenting (no i'm not implying that black people are bad parents, just that in a cycle of poverty they don't have much choice).
 
 
 
As I said, that's why I said it would not be a democracy, because so many people don't accept that there can be democracy without universal suffrage. I think there can be, and I think the country would be better for it.

 

Riiight   Joke  

 
You suppose to represent the entire medical world? What about those in private practice?

 

They're still altruistic, even if they do put more emphasis on money.

 
I was talking of healthy benifits. And those don't represent huge cost to the NHS.

 

Entertainment's a healthy benefit, mixing in with a social group is a healthy thing (well they're not harmful per se). And no they don't represent a huge cost but you can't say that it's ok just because it doesn't cost the NHS as much, that's hypocritical.

 
No. They claim they may come to harm. And why would that be? Maybe they've done something wrong? Maybe they're liars? All I know is that they have abused a priviledge, and I would revoke that priviledge. I'm not killing them, I'm simply putting them back in the situation they were before I was so gracious as to grant them entry into my country.

 

Well that's why the situation would be have to be assessed, to determine that they're not liars or whatever. But we'll just have to disagree again.

 
Oh my God! We literally disagree on everything! Cheese Toasties are the best! And Carrot Cake is kinda bleh..

 

Lmao, what'd I say huh? I wish I had some carrot cake right now

In essence black people were the first people on earth so from the black people you got the white, red, yellow and the brown man. This is your father speaking here.

Also please reveal to me what you have invented that is beneficial to mankind ?

You Steveee......... YOU !!

Not some inventor whose accomplishments you are imputing to a whole group.

Did you design the plane ? If not, why are you taking credit for it albeit indirectly ?

Have you created any vaccine that has saved lives ?

You take credit from individuals who you have never met. You appropriate the accomplishments of a few and by implication state that it is because they are white. Funny how you don't take credit for people like Stalin and Hitler of the fact that the majority of paedophiles are white. I think part of what underlies the emotion of your argument is the experience of seeing white people in day-to-day life claim credit and get rewarded for something that a person of colour did or thought of first. Your intelligence is limited to what the people who you respect have told you.

Well if your strong, then why are scared of black people ? Youâre the strong Caucasian white male arenât you ?

Why were the African armies defeated ?

SIMPLE ANSWER :

GUNPOWDER

The black man has never been defeated on the battlefield, sword with sword. During the Crusades, we fought him and beat him. He didn't have the gunpowder. Some of the leading warriors in the Muslim armies were from Africa. Indeed at the time of the first contacts with the Africans. The white northerners were but savages, greased in rancid bear fat with cow and goat butter used in their hair. The African historians mention the foul smell of them on several occasions. Not to mention that they were inept and disorganized warriors who got their heads handed to them by the African legions at every encounter. Their military strategy consisted of screaming, yelling, shouting, and charging head-on into the African archers and phalanxâa great way to end up skewered for your lack of intelligence. It was only after centuries of being defeated and later trained by Africans then fighting and trained by Romans that the UK barbarians became more efficient. But as I say African armies were only defeated when the Europeans got access to gunpowder. Marco Polo brought it back to Europe, and whites immediately started using it to kill people with. This is the differenceâthat European, whites have got something going for them that other people don't have going for them to the same extent.

WHITES LOVE TO KILL

In Africa, we kill for food. In Europe, they kill for sport. Whites get their kicks killing. I used to watch them, as a kid, when my dad used to take me to a farm in North Wales. I'd watch white people when they shoot a pheasant. When they shoot something, they just go CRAZY, like they were really getting their kicks. But they never defeated the African armies until they got gunpowder. Then with their gunpowder, they came in. In those days we had mastered the blade. You notice, today, white people have nightmares when they think a black man got a blade in his pocket because you know, that we know how to use it.

It takes a man to use a sword or blade, because you've got to have the heart to get up close to work with him and you could get stabbed yourself. But anybody can take a gun and stand at a distance and shoot at something that's no danger to him and once whites got a hold of the gun, that suited his nature; and he used it, and took over the world, with that gunpowder and his liesâI don't know which was the most effective.

 

  F-F-F-F-FACEPALM!  

Did you notice the bit where I talked about topigraphical and geographical factors? It's not inherent in race, but in locations. But of course, you obviously missed that so you could call me racist again   Nicely done  

Also ROFLMAO. I'd hardly consider egyptians Black for one. They are a mixture of arab and Black. And pretty much the only African culture ever to succeed. Don;t kid yourself, the Black world has never been at the forefront of anything. And those things you claim the Black world gave the world? Yeah? A couple of them can be attributed to the Egyptians, not the Black world, and most of them can't. And European 'savagrey' was still far more advanced than African tribes, who were far more savage. Africa had a few prospourus areas on the north, where surprise surprise, they traded with Whites and Arabs. But in 1400, Europe was full of massive stone castles, epic ships and growing cities. Africa? Mud huts. That was pretty much it barring the very northern fringes and Egypt. And pray tell how the Blacks were responsible for the European renaissance? I'd love to see how you came to that conclusion. Or are you once again going to ignore all my points and spout more spiel? You say things with absoloutley no evidence and then move on, not even acknowledging where I point out flaws.

Can't help but notice Blacks aren't there? HAve never said Whites were always the dominant race, just that blacks never have been.

Oh my God. Could you make more ridiculous arguments? I have never invented a plane? Damn, obviously that means I'm a racists and just trying to hide how great Black guys are. And hey, if we're talking about dictators. How about Mugabae? Gaddaffi? Mariam? Idi Amin? I could go on all day here  

Ahh I see. So the roman conquests of Africa never happened right? And why would there be a conserted effort against any African nation? What have they got? Africa was seen as the aresehole of the world from below the northern parts by the Romans, Greeks, Egyptians and everyone else after them for hundreds of years. There was never anything of worth there. And again, I'd love to see your evidence on this. Just a single source to demonstrate what you're saying isn't all complete bollox! Because that's how it seems, you make fantastical claims with absoloutley no evidence to back them up. I guess I'll give you the Kingdom of Axum, there were a militray power, but other than that? Nothing of note in Africa. And they got their asses handed to them b Europe before too long. Boom!

Pahahaha. Are you for real? Whites kill for fun, Blacks because they need to. And this all started out because you were accusing White people of making crazy racist sterotypes? ROFL -MOTHERF******- MAO! Ok then :L
 
 
 
Riiight   Joke  

They're still altruistic, even if they do put more emphasis on money.

Entertainment's a healthy benefit, mixing in with a social group is a healthy thing (well they're not harmful per se). And no they don't represent a huge cost but you can't say that it's ok just because it doesn't cost the NHS as much, that's hypocritical.

Well that's why the situation would be have to be assessed, to determine that they're not liars or whatever. But we'll just have to disagree again.

Lmao, what'd I say huh? I wish I had some carrot cake right now  

 

Ehh. You know, the greatest argument against democracy is 5 minutes with the average voter and all that  

Hmm. Are they? The private practice doctors I've seen didn't seem to be, but I guess they could have been having a bad day.

I can, I will, and it's not. Drugs, alcohol and food require abuse to be harmful, I'm not denying they are perfectly fine in social doses. Sport however plays an important role in society. Entertainment for the masses. Good source of excersise. Promotes kinship and team building. Helps to teach children values and discipline. Many positives, none of which I can see with substance abuse.

Equally, as I've said before. Abuse of a substance is a downward slope with obvious health detriments, sport has all these good aspects, alongside a small chance of injury. Plus, the majority of injuries don't end up that expensive. Basic strains, a few broken bones, maybe ligament damage etc. There may be the odd expensive surgery, but for the most part, not so much. Whereas liver and kidney failure? Not cheap. Transplants? Not cheap. Bypasses? Not cheap.

Liars? I've already made this clear, in such a world 'will-power' is no excuse. Unless you have a recognised medical condition, too bad. If you can't bring yourself to get on the treadmill, then no hip replacement for you. Keep smoking? Dang, we're not treating that breast cancer. Been hitting the smack hard? Sorry lovey, dialisis is expensive.

Hmmm. Do you like videos of cute cats doing funny things? Noone can dislike this.

Hmm true to an extent I guess

Well ok, not all of them but I certainly wouldn't question some of the professors and doctors I've met in private practice.

Yeah you can't see them, but there are benefits as I've outlined several times. If there were not no one would do it. And the point is that there are safer methods, risk-free methods, to do all those benefits you've proposed.

Yes drug abuse has obvious health problems, but that's the only difference to sports. I'm saying it is hypocritical but I guess hypocrisy isn't the least of the problems in this society.

Well that quote was in response to the eye for an eye thing, not obesity. But just to add a point, the difference between your society and the one at the moment is that if someone doesn't lose weight, the medical profession doesn't just give up on them.

 
Hmmm. Do you like videos of cute cats doing funny things? Noone can dislike this.

Malformed link  
 
 
 
- Over emphasied by the media.
- Racist police force - a black person can be up to 7 times more likely to be stopped and searched.
- Stereotype public more likely to report 'black gangs lurking around' than white 'groups'.
- Public may assume in a victim survey that the criminal was 'black'.
- Police forced to assume media's folk devil. E.G, the "black mugger". Police tackle the so called "problem" for statistics.
- Sentencing for black criminals is longer than white criminals, making the black criminal seem like their identicial crime was 'worse'.
- Very scarce positive representation of black population, over representation of negative minority. No discussion or little discussion on 'white people and crime'.
- Stereotyping, 'assumed they are guilty' means black people are more likely to be held in custody than whites. Not exactly helping their case against the court.
- Lack of role models.
- Some black minorities may 'assume' their negative label.
- Some black commuinities may stereotype police as racist and working against them, and hence may appear more suspsicious - may not be able to recieve just a caution.

 

Well Done! You've summed up all the relevant points! Couldn't have put it better!
 
 
 
here we go again you are aware non white people are over represented at oxford? funny isn't it how indians and chinese do just fine at oxford but as usual black people must blame their failures on racism. how pathetic i am sick of the whining because other minority groups prove this sort of nonsense completely wrong.

 

You're speaking about minority groups as if they are children. The social differences are a major factor when talking about such sensitive issues. Why are you trying to point out the 'success' of other races in comparison to black people? As I said, you're speaking about minority groups as if they're children. At the end of the day people are just people so there are no genetic reasons to why black people are over-represented in the prison population. 'Blacks must blame their failures on racism', you need to pick your words carefully. Black people haven't, nor have ever or will ever fail. I am a living example of the many numerous examples of black people succeeding. Maybe you should newsnight on BBC Iplayer, Wednesday the 15th to see one of the many intelligent, knowledgeable, and courteous black women in the UK. Then you said 'I am sick of the whining', who was complaining to you? You knew exactly what you were coming to look at before you clicked on this thread, so DO NOT pretend that you have seen something that was unexpected. Secondly, to be quite blunt and frank, I, and others don't really give a damn if you are sick of 'whining'. Clearly you are two pig-headed to see things from the other side and we can't expect you to because you are too narrow minded. 'Black people must blame their failures on racism', well what can white people blame their failures on? Because I've seen plenty of white trash so therefore the white race must be failing, right? Just because you see a couple of black people failing at life doesn't mean the black race is failing. Essentially, we are all individuals whether black or white. On top of that, the type, amount and effects of racism that black people have suffered within this country and worldwide is tenfold that of ANY Asian group. Just because Asians are now the primary target of racism by the white supremacists doesn't mean that black people haven't suffered or are still not suffering from racism and prejudice and I can tell this from my own experience. Finally (as I know you won't read what I have written above), if you are severely unable to participate in an intelligent dicussion which deals with sensitive issues, I would advise you to silently leave this forum as any input you add will be invalid and irrelevant to the actual issue at hand. Next time you post on an intellectual thread like this was supposed to be, make sure you have something to support your statements rather than looking for thumbs up.

P.S I am looking forward to attending Oxford University or any other world class university for that matter, as a black person! I am sure in the future you will an alumni of one of such prestiguous universities, right?
 
 
Very short, blunt and simple answer but still i'll have to second all the previous posters of...Role models.
 
 
 
And the funny thing, is that the UK is by far one of the most tolerant countries in the EU.

 

I know, just shows how far we HAVEN'T come.

hello you think i look for thumbs up i get negatives, so do not think i am looking for negs. you are paranoid if you think you get reps for negative views on black people on here always they are negative

i am not saying all black people are failing most are not but it is impossible to deny the blame culture that emanates from from this community. i just wonder why there is so much blame and denial and why everything blamed on the spectre if racism which is annoying to me.

Unfortunately, I seriously, cannot understand what you are getting at. Are trying to say that black people try to blame other people for whatever has gone wrong in their lives? Well, then you have some deeper myths to dispell than I first thought. I have never heard a black person blame their own individual failure on the society, in my experience. Secondly, if you didn't mean all black people, then why say such inflammatory statements? Furthermore, if you think the 'black community' has a blame culture, then you should look to the wider British society and see the blame culture there and the attitude that you can just say anything and then apologise later and it will all be fine. Maybe, we should address that before going into black people's 'blame culture' which I, as a black person, have never seen.
 
 
This thread will never end.
 
 
because people who come from more well off families tend to do better in life because they have more opportunities to succeed then those from the lower class. Coming from slavery Blacks had to work their slowly up in society and fighting racism it has been hard to do so until the past 50 or so odd years. Poverty leads to crime.
 
 
I have no idea, been nearly robbed twice by black guys as well but i can run haha,
in high school, **** loads of somalian came after some asian guy and they started attacking everyone on the playground, one walked towards me with a dumb bar and was like give me your phone! must have been about 5 years older than me, normally i'd be scared but my dad only just gave me that phone and being black he'd probably do worse to me, so i was like nah, don't think so, he chased me but i was pretty fast in high school, about 11.4/5 in high school so managed to get away
 
 
 
It was implicit in his initial statement (to which he has since made substantial modifications). I do not consider a simple post racist, and never do; however, I inferred from the initial statement that he felt it was 'racially' linked, which it isn't.

 

I wasn't really aiming it at anyone, you don't have to justify anything to me. I'm just making a general statement about what tends to happen on TSR.

People love to jump the gun here.
 
 
 
Poverty does not cause crime. That is a very poor excuse thought up by the left. Bad morals is what causes crime and 99% of criminals grew up in awful households where they were raised poorly.

To make the excuse that poverty causes crime is shameful.  

 

would love to see where you got this statistic from, if it exists, 'cos i'm pretty sure you just made that up. what about the middle class kids who commit crime just because they have 'nothing to do'?
 
 
 
And pray tell how the Blacks were responsible for the European renaissance?

 

THE FIRST PEOPLE IN ENGLAND WERE BLACK PEOPLE

 http://www.africaresource.com/rasta/...ient-europeans 

The original british and irish were black, they were called the GRIMALDIES. It was only three thousand years ago that whiteman became the dominant type in an African-owned Europe. Before that it was Black-skinned African. For more than 48,000 years Black-skinned Africans would have been the only Europeans. Europe was discovered and mapped by Black skin Africans. Europe of yesterday, today and tomorrow will ever remain Africaâs heritage.

How were blacks responsible for the European renaissance ?

Well, from about 711 A.D. when the Moors, a Black people from Senegal, West Africa and Morocco, invaded Europe. They introduced Black Moorish science, technology, civilization and education to Europe and raised the Europeans from the Dark Ages of about 400 A.D. to 711 A.D. The Black Moors introduced advanced learning to Spain, similar to what had been taking place in Ghana, and at the university city of Jenne in Mali for hundreds of years. They introduced advanced learning to the cities of Toledo, Seville and Cordoba. These cities became centers of Black Moorish and European scholarship, science and culture, where Europeans and others learned new and advanced sciences, arts and technologies. That led to the European Renaissance of later years. The Black Moors introduced art, architecture, sciences, medicines, mining, animal husbandry and other advanced disciplines to Spain and the rest of Europe. This was the catalyst which led to the European Renaissance

Western and Eastern Europe, (excluding Rome, Greece, etc.) have very little history of great civilization and achievements before the Middle Ages. Africans have had thousands of years of great contributions to world culture and civilizations. The British, French, Spanish, Dutch, Scandinavians, Germanics, Celts, Russians, Poles and many of these groups who claim "superiority" to Blacks and others, were from prehistoric times until the 1500's A.D., much less advanced economically, culturally, intellectually and scientifically as well as socially than most Black nations, kingdoms and empires during that period.

From the time of the Roman conquest of Europe about 400 B.C. to the about 1200 A.D., much of Northern and Western Europe was in a stage or barbarism and backwardness. The Roman settlements and cities built by the Romans were the ONLY areas of advanced culture. Black people were the original inventors of the disciplines that helped bring the world into the technological age. Mathematics, physics, astronomy, building in stone and bricks, metallurgy and all the root subjects that were necessary to push the world into today's modern age, were begun by Blacks in Egypt, Nubia-Kush, Mesopotamia, Sabea and Black Naga India. For example, the Africans invented the binary system which is still used in the Yoruba oracle and was copied by German scientists and applied to computer programming. Many ancient formulas in trigonometry, calculus and physics as well as chemistry (Khem mysteries) came from the scientific discoveries of Blacks in Egypt and Nubia-Kush.

Most Western European scientific discoveries or rather copies of the original discoveries of Africans and Chinese were put to use during the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. It was during this crucial period that some of the great scientific and technological discoveries and inventions were made. Yet, these discoveries and inventions were and are merely improvements on ancient discoveries made by Africans Blacks. For example, gunpowder was invented by the ancient Nigerians who used the cola nut to make gunpowder. The Chinese reinvented it and used it in fireworks and explosives. Steel was invented by Africans in ancient Tanzania, where ancient cone-like blast furnaces with bellows still exist to this very day and are still used. The hydraulic pump for lifting water and irrigation was invented by Africans in Egypt

Therefore, even if people of European origins have made improvements in ancient technologies and ancient inventions, such as rocketry, computer technology, aerodynamics and others, the basic mathematical formulas and ancient prototypes were invented by Africans and Chinese. You see, SERIOUS White historians know these facts very well they also know that to tell the truth would reveal the dominate position of the Blackman in the bronze-age. SERIOUS white historians know they were barbarians when the foundation of world civilization was built by black men. Few western historians will tell the full story of man's racial history to do so would challenge the Aryan model of history so deeply ingrained in western culture. One fact I will emphasize again and again is that SERIOUS White historians are NOT ignorant of the truth about black history and in many cases they confirm it themselves.

Black Athena: The Fabrication of Ancient Greece By Martin Bernal

 http://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Athena...446034-2667316 

 
I'd hardly consider egyptians Black for one. They are a mixture of arab and Black. And pretty much the only African culture ever to succeed. Don;t kid yourself, the Black world has never been at the forefront of anything. And those things you claim the Black world gave the world? Yeah? A couple of them can be attributed to the Egyptians, not the Black world, and most of them can't.

 

The white man done you disservice by lying to you but you have been lied to so much that you actually believe the lies. Black people were the original settlers of Egypt. Egypt is a Greek word meaning Black. The Egyptians of the Bible were Negroid. Arabs invaded Egypt in the 7th Century AD; therefore, Arabs have no more connection to Ancient Egypt than Europeans have to Ancient America. Black Egyptians were eventually mixed with invading Libyans, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Turks, Arabs and Western Europeans. That is where the mixed people of the modern-day Arabs come from.

Cheikh Anta Diop actually did tests to find the racial origin of Egyptians in his book

âThe African Origin of Civilizationâ

 http://www.amazon.co.uk/African-Orig.../dp/1556520727 

He found...

1) Evidence from Physical Anthropology

The skeletons and skulls of the Ancient Egyptians clearly reflect they were Negroid people with features very similar to those of modern Black Nubians and other people of the Upper Nile and of East Africa.

2) Melanin Dosage Test

He invented a method for determining the level of melanin in the skin of human beings. When conducted on Egyptian mummies in the Museum of Man in Paris, this test indicated these remains were of Black people.

3) Osteological Evidence

"Lepsius canon," which distinguishes the bodily proportions of various racial groups categories the "ideal Egyptian" as "short-armed and of Negroid or Negrito physical type."

4) Evidence From Blood Types

He also noted that EVEN after hundreds of years of inter-mixture with foreign invaders, the blood type of modern Egyptians is the "same group B as the populations of western Africa on the Atlantic seaboard and not the A2 Group characteristic of the white race prior to any crossbreeding."

5) The Egyptians as They Saw Themselves

The Egyptians had only one term to designate themselves =kmt= the Negroes (literally). This is the strongest term existing in the Pharaonic tongue to indicate blackness; it is accordingly written with a hieroglyph representing a length of wood charred at the end and not crocodile scales," singular. Kmt from the adjective =kmt= black; it therefore means strictly Negroes or at the very least black men. The term is a collective noun which thus described the whole people of Pharaonic Egypt as a black people."

6) Testimony of Classical Greek and Roman Authors

Virtually all of the early Latin eyewitnesses described the Ancient Egyptians as Black skinned with wooly hair. Read Herodutus and Pythagorus. Read what they say and how they described the people in Egypt. After the conquest of Egypt by Alexander, under the Ptolemies, crossbreeding between white Greeks and black Egyptians flourished.

These facts prove that if the Egyptian people had originally been white or Arab, it might well have remained so. If Herodotus found it still black after so much crossbreeding, it must have been basic black at the start. I know this is painful. You like most whites are desparate prove at any price that the Egyptians were not black.
 
 
Come on people we cannot blame poverty on the fact that people go out and rob people. We live in the UK for gods sake where vitually every person with a low income or no income at all can claim benefits. It just annoys me to death that people say that they have the 'hustle' to make a living. We dont live in New York. There is a thing called income support in the United Kingdom.
 
 
 
Now, let me me make it clear to you that I am definately NOT a racist. I don't judge people by their race, only by actions of individuals. ANY racist hate-filled comment on this thread WILL MORE THAN DEFINATELY be deleted. I'm aware that this is a taboo subject to talk about, so if you're black, please don't get offended. I didn't make this thread in an attempt to offend people, and spread hate.I know crime happens amongst all races, and I made this thread to find out why it's bigger in the black community. I also have quite a few black friends who are also concerned about this issue, so that's another reason not to take offence.

I live in south London, and I just read an article about Black people and crime on MailOnline, and that the figures released by the met police show that black men commit most of the crime in London.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...--victims.html 

My own experiences

I've never actually been successfully robbed, but pretty much all of the people who attemped to rob me (at school) happened to be black. Everytime somebody was aggressive towards me during school they almost always hapened to be black.

There was one black person in my class who didn't bring any equipment with him, so he asked me if i could lend him some equipment. I knew he had a reputation for 'borrowing' equipment and then not returning it back. Initially I said "no", because I was worried he won't return it back. Then he came up to me in an aggressive stance, and threatened to punch me and then take my compass...so I just had no choice but to give it to him. At the end of the lesson I asked for it back, he didn't give it straight away, and he put my compass in his bottom and rubbed it...then put it it in my hands?? Seriously??

I remember standing in the line while waiting for lunch at lunchtime at school, and this group of black students just barged in front of me. When I politely told them that I was there first, one of the black students gave me an EXTREMELY hard punch, and left my arm stinging for a while... There are endless cases which I can talk about, but I'd be here all day.

My mother has only been robbed twice, and on both occassions it involved black youths. When my mother first came into this country from South-Asia about 21 years ago, a group of black youths in Streatham approached her while she was in my Father's car. They asked her if she had any tissue, so she gave them some tissue, and then one of them grabbed her gold necklace and ran off with it. 3 years ago my Mother was at a checkpoint about to withdraw some cash, and a black youth behind her must have been looking at her pin, and she wasn't aware than the youth was behind her as half her attention was on my baby sister. Then more black youths came and told her to hurry up, and kept her distracted while another one took my Mum's credit card and ran off with it, and they knew my Mum's pin and took about Â£200. And yes, my mum did report this to the police, but they never managed to trace the boys down.

This experience is by far the most shocking experience I've had. In 2007 when I was in year 8, I was walking with two friends down tooting in South London, and a group of black teenagers approached us. They didn't go for me, but the went for my other friend. They asked him for a pound or they would take his phone. He didn't have a pound, but he begged and pleaded with them not to take his phone. After a bit of a struggle while they grabbed him, one of the black teenagers flicked hot ash from his cigarrete he was smoking into his eyes, then ran off with his school tie and phone. The police picked up the boy who was robbed and drove around in tooting to look for the boys who robbed him, but never found them.

My question is, why is crime in the black community significantly higher than other communities? And (from my experience), why some black people are a bit more aggressive than the aggressive people in other races?

 

I also live in South London and I am black. I'm not offended about what you said because I've lived in Brixton and Peckham, places which are populated with black people, living below the poverty line. From my experiences, Black crime is caused because of difficult childhoods and low income. Luckly for me that was never a problem and I've moved from those areas after my parents car was stolen by Black youths. I do think it is high because most of the people who do things like this, have never known how to do anything else with their lives. Sadly some of them think that they will get a reputation, people will be scared of them.
Even though it's hard not to judge people in certain situations, I've learned to not think about what they are doing, but why they are doing it and not judge them for it because for some of them it could be the only way to live.
 
 
 
Hmm true to an extent I guess  

Well ok, not all of them but I certainly wouldn't question some of the professors and doctors I've met in private practice.

Yeah you can't see them, but there are benefits as I've outlined several times. If there were not no one would do it. And the point is that there are safer methods, risk-free methods, to do all those benefits you've proposed.

Yes drug abuse has obvious health problems, but that's the only difference to sports. I'm saying it is hypocritical but I guess hypocrisy isn't the least of the problems in this society.

Well that quote was in response to the eye for an eye thing, not obesity. But just to add a point, the difference between your society and the one at the moment is that if someone doesn't lose weight, the medical profession doesn't just give up on them.

Malformed link  

 

I'm talking about tangiable benifits to the body and society. Not benifit to the person's mind alone. Sport will garner you enjoyment and keep you fit. Drugs will garner you enjoyment and little else.

As I've outlined, sport brings clear benifit and has a place within healthy society, drug and food abuse do not. Social use yes, abuse no.

It's not giving up on them, it's them giving up on themselves.

Oh. Well take my word for it, it was a cute cat.

Many artists (in the literal sense of the word and Musicians, etc) claim to have been on drugs when they created their best work, I'd call that a benefit. And sure it doesn't benefit the body, but it does the mind through entertainment and in some cases social acceptance, so that is still a benefit regardless. And sports provides entertainment to the society, drugs provide entertainment to the society (not to mention creating an economy for dealers and the sort). So on some level they both contribute to society.

This sounds like I'm encouraging drug use but I'm really playing devil's advocate to try and prove that what you're saying is hypocrisy.

 
As I've outlined, sport brings clear benifit and has a place within healthy society, drug and food abuse do not. Social use yes, abuse no.

 

I think drugs bring clear benefits as well, even if it is just feeding an addiction. It is only because of campaigning that we have been convinced it is socially unacceptable in modern society. My only point is that there's a chance drug abuse will wind you up in hospital and there's a chance playing sports will wind you up in hospital. The fact that sports injuries aren't as expensive to treat in most cases is irrelevant. The argument is that the two are similar on some level, therefore to not offer health service to one for being careless, you cannot offer it to the other.

 
It's not giving up on them, it's them giving up on themselves.

 

That's a philosophical response but doesn't really mean anything. Denying them healthcare is you giving up on them, anything else you say is just an excuse to give you piece of mind.

 
Oh. Well take my word for it, it was a cute cat.

THE FIRST PEOPLE IN ENGLAND WERE BLACK PEOPLE

 http://www.africaresource.com/rasta/...ient-europeans 

The original british and irish were black, they were called the GRIMALDIES. It was only three thousand years ago that whiteman became the dominant type in an African-owned Europe. Before that it was Black-skinned African. For more than 48,000 years Black-skinned Africans would have been the only Europeans. Europe was discovered and mapped by Black skin Africans. Europe of yesterday, today and tomorrow will ever remain Africaâs heritage.

How were blacks responsible for the European renaissance ?

Well, from about 711 A.D. when the Moors, a Black people from Senegal, West Africa and Morocco, invaded Europe. They introduced Black Moorish science, technology, civilization and education to Europe and raised the Europeans from the Dark Ages of about 400 A.D. to 711 A.D. The Black Moors introduced advanced learning to Spain, similar to what had been taking place in Ghana, and at the university city of Jenne in Mali for hundreds of years. They introduced advanced learning to the cities of Toledo, Seville and Cordoba. These cities became centers of Black Moorish and European scholarship, science and culture, where Europeans and others learned new and advanced sciences, arts and technologies. That led to the European Renaissance of later years. The Black Moors introduced art, architecture, sciences, medicines, mining, animal husbandry and other advanced disciplines to Spain and the rest of Europe. This was the catalyst which led to the European Renaissance

Western and Eastern Europe, (excluding Rome, Greece, etc.) have very little history of great civilization and achievements before the Middle Ages. Africans have had thousands of years of great contributions to world culture and civilizations. The British, French, Spanish, Dutch, Scandinavians, Germanics, Celts, Russians, Poles and many of these groups who claim "superiority" to Blacks and others, were from prehistoric times until the 1500's A.D., much less advanced economically, culturally, intellectually and scientifically as well as socially than most Black nations, kingdoms and empires during that period.

From the time of the Roman conquest of Europe about 400 B.C. to the about 1200 A.D., much of Northern and Western Europe was in a stage or barbarism and backwardness. The Roman settlements and cities built by the Romans were the ONLY areas of advanced culture. Black people were the original inventors of the disciplines that helped bring the world into the technological age. Mathematics, physics, astronomy, building in stone and bricks, metallurgy and all the root subjects that were necessary to push the world into today's modern age, were begun by Blacks in Egypt, Nubia-Kush, Mesopotamia, Sabea and Black Naga India. For example, the Africans invented the binary system which is still used in the Yoruba oracle and was copied by German scientists and applied to computer programming. Many ancient formulas in trigonometry, calculus and physics as well as chemistry (Khem mysteries) came from the scientific discoveries of Blacks in Egypt and Nubia-Kush.

Most Western European scientific discoveries or rather copies of the original discoveries of Africans and Chinese were put to use during the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. It was during this crucial period that some of the great scientific and technological discoveries and inventions were made. Yet, these discoveries and inventions were and are merely improvements on ancient discoveries made by Africans Blacks. For example, gunpowder was invented by the ancient Nigerians who used the cola nut to make gunpowder. The Chinese reinvented it and used it in fireworks and explosives. Steel was invented by Africans in ancient Tanzania, where ancient cone-like blast furnaces with bellows still exist to this very day and are still used. The hydraulic pump for lifting water and irrigation was invented by Africans in Egypt

Therefore, even if people of European origins have made improvements in ancient technologies and ancient inventions, such as rocketry, computer technology, aerodynamics and others, the basic mathematical formulas and ancient prototypes were invented by Africans and Chinese. You see, SERIOUS White historians know these facts very well they also know that to tell the truth would reveal the dominate position of the Blackman in the bronze-age. SERIOUS white historians know they were barbarians when the foundation of world civilization was built by black men. Few western historians will tell the full story of man's racial history to do so would challenge the Aryan model of history so deeply ingrained in western culture. One fact I will emphasize again and again is that SERIOUS White historians are NOT ignorant of the truth about black history and in many cases they confirm it themselves.

Black Athena: The Fabrication of Ancient Greece By Martin Bernal

 http://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Athena...446034-2667316 

The white man done you disservice by lying to you but you have been lied to so much that you actually believe the lies. Black people were the original settlers of Egypt. Egypt is a Greek word meaning Black. The Egyptians of the Bible were Negroid. Arabs invaded Egypt in the 7th Century AD; therefore, Arabs have no more connection to Ancient Egypt than Europeans have to Ancient America. Black Egyptians were eventually mixed with invading Libyans, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Turks, Arabs and Western Europeans. That is where the mixed people of the modern-day Arabs come from.

Cheikh Anta Diop actually did tests to find the racial origin of Egyptians in his book

âThe African Origin of Civilizationâ

 http://www.amazon.co.uk/African-Orig.../dp/1556520727 

He found...

1) Evidence from Physical Anthropology

The skeletons and skulls of the Ancient Egyptians clearly reflect they were Negroid people with features very similar to those of modern Black Nubians and other people of the Upper Nile and of East Africa.

2) Melanin Dosage Test

He invented a method for determining the level of melanin in the skin of human beings. When conducted on Egyptian mummies in the Museum of Man in Paris, this test indicated these remains were of Black people.

3) Osteological Evidence

"Lepsius canon," which distinguishes the bodily proportions of various racial groups categories the "ideal Egyptian" as "short-armed and of Negroid or Negrito physical type."

4) Evidence From Blood Types

He also noted that EVEN after hundreds of years of inter-mixture with foreign invaders, the blood type of modern Egyptians is the "same group B as the populations of western Africa on the Atlantic seaboard and not the A2 Group characteristic of the white race prior to any crossbreeding."

5) The Egyptians as They Saw Themselves

The Egyptians had only one term to designate themselves =kmt= the Negroes (literally). This is the strongest term existing in the Pharaonic tongue to indicate blackness; it is accordingly written with a hieroglyph representing a length of wood charred at the end and not crocodile scales," singular. Kmt from the adjective =kmt= black; it therefore means strictly Negroes or at the very least black men. The term is a collective noun which thus described the whole people of Pharaonic Egypt as a black people."

6) Testimony of Classical Greek and Roman Authors

Virtually all of the early Latin eyewitnesses described the Ancient Egyptians as Black skinned with wooly hair. Read Herodutus and Pythagorus. Read what they say and how they described the people in Egypt. After the conquest of Egypt by Alexander, under the Ptolemies, crossbreeding between white Greeks and black Egyptians flourished.

These facts prove that if the Egyptian people had originally been white or Arab, it might well have remained so. If Herodotus found it still black after so much crossbreeding, it must have been basic black at the start. I know this is painful. You like most whites are desparate prove at any price that the Egyptians were not black.

 

There are so many things wrong in your post it's hard to know where to start.

For one the Moors were actually a mixture of Arabs, southern Europeans and Blacks, and occupied Spain and Portugal. You're trying to claim they introduced learning to SPain, which is one of the most absurd claims I've ever heard. Another is you claim they were some sort of direct catalyst for the Reniessance that didn't happen until hundreds of years after the Moors as a people became all but null and void.

Barbarism and backwardness? Are we talking about the same places? How exactly were the African kingdoms anymore advanced? As I said before, we had great cities, castles and monasteries all across Europe. Excluding the very tips of Africa there was nought but mud huts and tribes. There has been only 1 'black' great civilisation and that was the Kingom of Axum, and they weren't all that great. Egyptians may have considered themselves black, but infact that were definatley in the ground between Black and Arab, certainly not 100% Black. Equally it is clear to see that all European Empires far over shadowed the Egyptians. I mean during the times you talk of nothing but barbarism we had the flourishing of Constanintenople, Florence, Venice, Byzantine. All throughout that time we had various Kingdoms over Europe. No great progress was made, but it certainly wasn't barbarism  

As I've said before, nothing from Egypt is 'Black'. And Egypt is but one civilisation. You remark on all the discoveries made, but far more have been discovered in European, Arab and Chinese Empires and Dynasties than has ever been by Blacks. The Greeks were the fathers of maths, the Romans the fathers of a great number of things, I'll give the Egyptians irrigation, along with Messoptamia, but other than that? Nada. They had some hand in Maths, but no great extent.

Re-invention, perhaps you have something there, but then you have to ask yourself. Who is better, the people who discovered it and did nothing with it, or the people who re-discovered it and made great things out of it? I didn't see any plate armoud in Tanzania, no cannons in Nigeria. Oh, but I'd love to see some evidence for your claim about Nigeria, seeing as the prevailing acedemic consensus is that it was first invented and documented in China iin the 9th century.

Oh I see. Ok. The first basic elements of triginometry were documented in Egypt? Clearly the computer was invented by Black men then. First ore smelted was in Africa? Damn, tell the people who built the Eiffel Tower that they didn't do anything man, it was all the Black dudes.   By definition, something has to come first. But hey, guess what? The first evidence of stone headed spears can be found in Germany, so I guess Whites have invented all melee weapons ever really. Cast Iron? China, so everything ever made out of Iron is owed to China. First evidence of a circular hand crank? Spain, all down to Whites again. The crossbow? China or Greece. Paper? China. Arches? Romans. Cranks? Turbins? Domes? Romans. Fire based weapons? Greeks/Romans. But I guess all of those discoveries were made by a Black guy really, because a mixed Arab/Black guy invented maths. Right? Right?  

Modern scientific consensus is that Egyptians were essentially mixed race. With most of the famous figures of the time presenting as a mixture between 'Black African' and Arab/European. The only opposition to this comes from organisations with names such as the Journal of African Sciencetific History. Addmitedly there is contraversy surrounding the issue, but there is consensus even from the Egyptian Museum of Antiquieties that Egypt was not fully 'Black'.

1 & 3 are not ture, or at least in dispute. Other instituions have determined that the bodies of famous figures such as Tutankhamun and Cleopatra have distinctly non-African features, as well as some negroid features. This actually lends credence to the theory of other influences on the ruling class, whilst the actual citizens were more black. Equally in many Heiroglyphics wives for Pharos' coming from the south were depicted as Black, while egyptians were depicted as pale brown or pink.

I shall look at the writings.

And, if you say so  

I do find it funny however, that you accuse me of racism considering the statements you have made. All Whites love to kill. All Whites are racist. European civilisation was 'barbarism' between 700-144 A.D etc.

And my 'racist' point to begin with? That crime statistics showed that black inner city youths wwere far over represented in crime and it was an issue that needed to be addressed.   God, I am such a racist eh?
 
 
 
Many artists (in the literal sense of the word and Musicians, etc) claim to have been on drugs when they created their best work, I'd call that a benefit. And sure it doesn't benefit the body, but it does the mind through entertainment and in some cases social acceptance, so that is still a benefit regardless. And sports provides entertainment to the society, drugs provide entertainment to the society (not to mention creating an economy for dealers and the sort). So on some level they both contribute to society.

This sounds like I'm encouraging drug use but I'm really playing devil's advocate to try and prove that what you're saying is hypocrisy.

I think drugs bring clear benefits as well, even if it is just feeding an addiction. It is only because of campaigning that we have been convinced it is socially unacceptable in modern society. My only point is that there's a chance drug abuse will wind you up in hospital and there's a chance playing sports will wind you up in hospital. The fact that sports injuries aren't as expensive to treat in most cases is irrelevant. The argument is that the two are similar on some level, therefore to not offer health service to one for being careless, you cannot offer it to the other.

That's a philosophical response but doesn't really mean anything. Denying them healthcare is you giving up on them, anything else you say is just an excuse to give you piece of mind.

Lol

 

Ahh, notice what I said however. Abuse of these drugs. If they're used in moderation then that's fine. But not when they are abused. Heroin and crack rarely lead to creative thoughts. The drugs that do that are Cannabis, LSD, LSA, mushrooms and so on. Which have far less harmful side effects, and are difficult to 'abuse' in the traditional sense.

Tell me what benifits Heroin and Crack bring to a person, other than the 'good' feeling? Do they help to keep them healthy? Promote teamwork? Help people to learn discipline and a role in society? Provide entertainment for others? As I've said, it's about abuse, not general use. And abuse of drugs that are seriously harmful.

Right. Not giving someone money? Is that giving up on them? Not doing their work for them? Is that giving up on them? You see it as giving up on them because healthcare has always been there for you. But I see it as a priviledge, and if you don't fit the criteria, then you don't get it. It is available to everyone, everyone who follows the rules. But when you abuse the system, by seeking help for such obviously self induced conditions, then you are responsible for the denied service yourself,. The NHS didn't put the cake in your mouth, you did.
 
 
I think that black people can be quite violent too, because one of my friends went out with a black boy but one day, she told him that she would have to start a fresh life; indirectly indicating that she wants to break up with him, because a lot of her relatives and other people in her community dissapproved how she's bonding with a person from another race. however, when he heard that, he threatened her with her life, which sounded quite scary

However, some black people can be very nice. Once, I went shopping and I hurt myself while I was climbing up the stairs. Embarassed, 2 black girls went past me and I was actually expecting them to laugh, but instead comforted me by saying 'are you alright?'

I also have a black friend ever siince primary who still seems very nice.
 
 
 
The numbers refer to each of your paragraphs:

1. It's not a proper study, also ask yourself why the Jews the Asians and the Indians can all &quot;work themselves out of the the Ghetto&quot; whilst the blacks just don't

2. I agree poor people do more crime, but why are a dispraportionately high level of blacks poor?

3. Middle class area? Middle class school? Let me guess black people are underrepresented.

4. It is possibly genetic whilst all races have the potential to create &quot;geniuses&quot; ice age, africa favoured a strong (Could fight for women) virile man who could impregnate many women who would be able to easily get food without him. Whereas ice age Europe/Asia(Especially) favoured a man who knew how to build good shelters, could farm and knew which food to eat during the summer months and which to keep for winter(Keep the ones which don't perish so easily). Furthermore in this part of the world men who stuck with their women (To provide food) where more likely to keep their young alive as, whereas the caveman &quot;players&quot; didn't do so well as their kids would have been more likely to die due to the harsh conditions.
A slightly more esoteric theory (These are only theories afterall), which I have come up with is lead poisoning (Bear with me). Poor people(Black people especially I believe) are statistically more likely to have higher levels of the heavy metal due to living in poorly maintained, older housing (The projects) as well as suffer from poor nutrition. The condition has been documented to decrease IQ, increase aggressive and impulsive behaviour, especially sexual aggressiveness, but who knows?
The problem is that it seems that the West's balls have just dropped off and no one with a good reputation has the guts to conduct a serious study(Apart from racalists racists, but I said good reputation) so until China (Let's face it, it's gonna be them) do some kind of genetic study to determine whether or not, it is due to genes or environment or both, we shall never know and the problems will continue.

 

You don't sound exactly neutral, you sound like you want to believe that black people are innately predisposed to crime. I'm absolutely not trying to excuse criminals, because they should be punished but why do a lot of black people live in bad areas? It started with anti-black racism (let's not forget the conditions in which most black people first came to the UK ie the slave trade) and black people being marginalised by society and not being given equal opportunities. If you can't get a good job, you move into a poorer area where you can afford housing. If you live in a deprived area with a lack of funds when despite your best effort no one wants to give you a job that transcends beyond labour, many resort to getting means any way they can. As egalitarian as our modern society now purports to be, it is quite difficult to move up classes. That's why there are so many support schemes for first in the family university students.

Of course, I believe it's nurture and not nature. Black people aren't that under-represented in my sixth form, in fact there are many, and what I've said applies to them all. They're no different to a middle class white person behaviourally. Like I've said, bring up a white baby in an impoverished village and the IQ would mirror those it was surrounded by. Testament to my theory, my black friends are banging out 10 A*s at GCSE and straight As at A-level. I firmly stand by the nurture argument. Even still, I know two black boys from Croydon who go to Cambridge, and LSE.

Also, please, there are Asian people in ghettos too http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article561272.ece.

I understand your point, but I'd say Asians at the time of assimilation into the UK didn't face the same slavery / labour stigmas as black people and therefore had better opportunities to branch into middle class lifestyles, however, having said that, Asians in rough areas clearly fall outside of this demographic.

I think that kind of research would be dangerous. I doubt it will pull anything up, but as you've said, the people keen to do it will be the racists, and it's quite easy to make evidence suit your argument, especially in detailed and complicated science that the masses will not be able to pick apart, but will take as truth. The lead thing may well be true, but a black person living in a normal house won't be affected. It's dangerous to tar everyone with the same brush, because innocent black people could be victimised because of it.

Sorry it's so long!

1. I honestly don't, no really I don't. The problem is with your argument is that every race race has suffered under the white man but in the UK and US, despite being treated badly, races other than black people have succeed even when they have been living in poor conditions. You slavery argument is very silly, "My great great grandfather whom I never knew was a slave therefore I do crime" come on. Our current society is extremely egalitarian, education free at the point of use, loans available for University, the fact that UCAS favour students with parents who have not had a University education, there really is no excuse for people of any ethnicity. There are more poor people than rich people taxing the rich to help the poor wins votes

2. This is not an attack on any ethnic group in particular but why can some poor people work hard do well and make something of themselves whilst others turn to crime, because some people are just cleverer, nicer and more hard working than others; those who happen to be poor as well as the above, go on to do well and cease being poor. The fact that the two black boys from Croydon went on to make something of themselves is a testement to them and it shows that there are no excuses, they made a decision to work hard, keep out of trouble and do well whilst others made a decision to mess around, smoke and get pregnant.

3. The article doesn't work and Orientals are under represented in crime statistics and Indians perform very well academically, despite the racism they have experienced.

4. Slavery is irrelevant; the Jews don't just sit break the law and blame the holocaust even though a considerable amount were actually there at the time, unlike the black people at the time. If you're so sure nothing would come up then surely you should be in favour of tht sort of research. If a reputable scientist did the research and proved that under the skin, we are all the same when it comes to behaviour and intelligence, then racists who often cite the poor quality research done in the past would have their argument blown apart. Same again if you deny the problem is there then nothing gets done and people continue to suffer.

Not a problem

I don't think you fully understood my point. There is no excuse for committing crime now. I said poverty incites crime, and you asked why so many black people live in bad areas. I meant slavery --> connotations of black people only being good for labour (yeaaars back) ---> black people mostly in poorly paid jobs --> would have to move to poorer area where they could afford housing --> concentration. I was saying that generations find it difficult to transcend their class - that's applicable to everyone, thus, many black people in ghettos. Besides, the two black boys had middle class parents anyway so... In fact I know one or two girls from Croydon, one going to Kings, two others Southampton, but again all but one has middle class parents. In fact, I'd say a lot has to do with parents.

As for Jews and Asians, they weren't associated with being only good for labour, which as I said opened up opportunities to more intellectual jobs. Again though, you can still find them in ghettos (well, I don't know about Jews, met two in my life), you just have to know where to go. There's a very Asian ghetto part of West Croydon actually.

In the present situation, I'd say if education was improved in bad areas and post education prospects, eventually there'd be a noticeable difference. In bad schools, it's not "cool" to be clever. If that mentality could be changed, I think the change would be drastic.
 
 
 
Ahh, notice what I said however. Abuse of these drugs. If they're used in moderation then that's fine. But not when they are abused. Heroin and crack rarely lead to creative thoughts. The drugs that do that are Cannabis, LSD, LSA, mushrooms and so on. Which have far less harmful side effects, and are difficult to 'abuse' in the traditional sense.

Tell me what benifits Heroin and Crack bring to a person, other than the 'good' feeling? Do they help to keep them healthy? Promote teamwork? Help people to learn discipline and a role in society? Provide entertainment for others? As I've said, it's about abuse, not general use. And abuse of drugs that are seriously harmful.

 

There are few benefits for drug abuse yes, but there are benefits nonetheless. That's the crucial point. It is irrelevant what the extent of the benefits are, the argument is that both sports and drugs can wind you up in hospital, despite the benefits.

 
Right. Not giving someone money? Is that giving up on them? Not doing their work for them? Is that giving up on them? You see it as giving up on them because healthcare has always been there for you. But I see it as a priviledge, and if you don't fit the criteria, then you don't get it. It is available to everyone, everyone who follows the rules. But when you abuse the system, by seeking help for such obviously self induced conditions, then you are responsible for the denied service yourself,. The NHS didn't put the cake in your mouth, you did.

 

That's a disingenous example since it's not as simple as "not giving them money". It is their right to have access to healthcare, they pay for it through their taxes. So you are denying them their entitlement but not only that, they have nowhere else to go. If they can't get healthcare from you, then that's the end of the line for them. So yes, I would say you most definitely are giving up on them, you are failing to do your job ( the job of the current health service is to provide necessary healthcare to anyone who needs it ). The current health service is not a priviledge, it is a right. Unless you've changed that core principle in your society, then your point is obsolete.

What are those benifits? I can't think of any. And it's risk verses reward as to what constitutes something the NHS shouldn't pay for. Heroin abuse verses Rugby, Rugby clearly has a much higher reward verses the risk.

Ahh, but what is the extent to their entitlement? That is what I'm changing, not the entitlement altogether. They all pay in, but I am putting a restriction on it. Everyone has access so long as they stay within the rules. Essentially it would be changed to more of an insurance system, to maxamise the benifits for those deserving of the service, whilst excluding those who don't.

I told you...entertainment, social blending, the feeling of euphoria, etc. Yes that is correct but what you're proposing is different to the current method. At the moment, the NHS will continually help someone to give up if they require treatment. They are not expected to do it of their own accord and if they can't, then the NHS won't just give up on them straight up.

Well that's completely different then. I was arguing from the point of view of the current system. But if you don't agree with that then there's not much I can do

Sport does all of this and more....

This was all hypothetical, you were pointing out flaws in my system. I rather think the moral values of todays medical profession a mere sidenote

Not the point...but it doesn't matter because I don't know about you but this is getting tedious now

Yeah, well I was trying to point out the flaws in your society using what I think are the best things of our society. But since you don't agree with any of those "positives", there's no point arguing.

Instead I'll leave you with this rather amusing smiley

Well, I think it is quite a point. As I said, reward verses risk and all that.

Ok :P

 
 
 
 
Socioeconomic factors i.e. poverty rather than a "pre-programmed" behavioural trait based on race as some racist scumbags will suggest.

 

Yes I agree, its like a vicious circle. people tend to get angry and rebel against the system too, if they are in an unfavourable situation in relation to the rest of the population. There is a perceived descrimination. So it is harder to get kids to stay in school and trust the system, then they get into gangs and crime. The best thing to do is to fight against those feelings and do whatever you can to be correct and get educated or internships, it will pay off. There are also studies that indicate lower IQ in black population, but I think the problem is the culture, IQ never stopped anyone from working and can in fact be improved with study.
 
 
Well the way I see it is this.

Socio-economic factors are a main contributor to crime. One could argue black people feel they themselves are on the periphery of society, and maybe society does treat them thus, so they commit crime and alienate themselves more. Which d They can also argue about lack of role models, but when you're over a certain age that doesn't really fit. Also, they only have to look at Obama for a role model of a very highly socially functioning, successful black male. So really I don't buy it. I think that the stigma and stereotyping bears some weight, in that- there are simply a lot of black people perpetrating crime. It's not a myth, it's not an old wives' tale. I think most people on here acknowledge it-so then you've got to look at the hows and whys.

The glorification of money, drugs, objectification of women etc in rap music, a predominantly black music genre, doesn't help. People could argue that there's no correalation between that and people commiting crime, but I disagree. If you buy into the iconography of rap music, and are influenced to gang-related crime however indirect, from rap music, then all I can say is yoiu're looking at it wrong. Some people glorify Tupac as some sort of black role model/come demi-god martyr-when he ended up shot dead for example. It's about picking the right role models.

Now as for poverty making people commit crime. Poverty is inarguably a big factor in crime. Look at certain areas with a predominantly white population and look at their crime figures- it's not just black people commiting crime. People see crime as a status quo. (living by the street/the gun mentality that gangsta rap music promotes) they see it as an alternative to an honest life and they're wrong. It's a self-fulfiling prophecy in a way.

I think what actually does diffrentiate black people from other minorities/races in terms of crime is the nature of it, and the level of severity. I can point out cases where black people were largely involved. Is this a coicidence? Are black people more likely to commit violent crime? Statistics probably dictate they are BUT you can't generalise a whole race on isolate incidences....

Is the media to blame for a negative potrayal of black people/minorities? Not being judgemental and certainly not being racist before the accusatons fly, but whenever I watch Crimewatch I've observed a lot of minorities are the "Wanted" ones. There's an old non PC joke about Crimewatch which I won't repeat... Would the media portray black people in a negative light? I don't neccessarily think it would. Especially not the BBC which is known for its candidness and political correctness.

But back to the issues at hand

In essence I think that people need to stop sticking to the same old excuses regarding minorites and crime and I'm not even talking about the minority groups themselves I'm talking about scions of left wing society who say "There's no role models for black people" There IS, but they need to look at the right role models and stop placing gangsta rappers on a pedestal because a glorification of crime etc is only going to lend to the stigmatisation and stereotyping.

Also I think that, society is evolving socially. Social mobility is occuring. People can be whoever they want to be now they've just got to beleive in themselves and stop this "I live in a ghetto so therefore I'm no good" approach. Some people haven't got the same level of ability as their counterparts who live in more salubrious suburbs but so what? With a bit of determination and positive energy focussed in the right ways you can break the barriers which are stopping you becoming what you want. /end aspirational talk.

Good answer, I think that really sums up the answer to my question, thank you for taking your time to type all that - appreciate it.
