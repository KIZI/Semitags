First he was for it, so much so he posed with them during a fundraiser for a private school that was intended to keep blacks out. Now he's "condeming it" a mere week or so later.

Think Heyluh Bawbuh is Presidential material?

Better yet, think The Citizen's Council is an upstanding organization?

Yes, no, maybe so?

Why/Why not?

Oh great...another racist crack from the "diversity of the left". Seems to be one of, if not THE, primary focus of the liberal attack on anyone who dares to challenge them. God forbid that they should point out the massive number of blacks that Governor Barbour assisted in regaining their lives on the coast of Mississippi following Katrina. You never hear about the outstanding job the governor and his administration performed in rebuilding MULTIPLE cities that were literally wiped out after that horrific storm. Homes weren't just flooded. They were swept away leaving slabs. Businesses vanished. Streets disappeared. And yet, in only a matter of a couple years, the majority of them were back to things as usual...People who lived there came back home. Business owners who worked there re-opened their doors and new roads to new opportunities have paved the way for all. If you visit the MS Gulf Coast, there are still scars of that terrible event, but the people of Biloxi, Gulfport, Long Beach, Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian and Waveland will tell you that it's never been better on the coast...thanks to Governor Haley Barbour and the "can-do" spirit of Mississippians. It wasn't just one city that was flooded and still struggles to meet it's resident's needs. It was and is an entire region that was revitalized with pride and perseverance...and very little complaining about what the federal government didn't do for them.

For the record, private schools DO NOT keep blacks out. That's one of the most IGNORANT statements ever. Anybody who wants to pay the tuition can attend the school of their choice.

Personally, I think that Gov. Barbour would make an excellent presidential candidate. Which is why he will come under such terrible judgement from the racially motivated liberal left. Is he perfect? No. Of course not. But, if anyone knows how to rebuild a nation in tatters, it's a man like Gov. Barbour who brought the Gulf Coast region back from the dead so that it's racially diverse population could thrive again.

Sadly, you're right in part. He doesn't really stand a chance. But not because he's a bigot. More likely because he will be labeled as one by the leftwing media while they ignore all the good he did for MS's large black population. He'll be black-balled because of his overly southern drawl. He'll be ridiculed because he's from MS....the same state that brought us B. B. King, Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones, OPRAH, Walter Payton and Jerry Rice.

But then, I guess, they are all entitled to be honored by the left.

But his bigotry will be whitewashed by the Rightwing media, so it's fair and balanced.
 
 
Two Questions for the aplogists in this thread:

2. How can you honestly defend Heyluh Bawbuh's stance and positions?

.....And, his faulty memory....  

 
"It probably was pretty nice, living as a white middle-class male in Mississippi in the 1960s. You had the right to vote, for example. You were free to do whatever you wanted, and to go wherever you wanted. You could live your own life, without fear of being killed by terrorist groups like the KKK.

But someone needs to tell Barbour that life was hell on earth for a lot of people in the Deep South for many decades, simply for no other reason than they were born with the wrong skin color. "

The Texas education board wants textbooks, among other things, to emphasize the significance of Christianity in the nations founding, minimize Thomas Jeffersons philosophy of separating church and state, play up the rise of conservatism in the 1980s and 1990s, and down play Latino history."

Actually there were some Black 's there too, even though the DNC Ranks and the Controlled Media discouraged participation by calling the Tea Party Racist, by painting it as ugly and hateful, by claiming that it stole from MLK, it was there, in part, to honor him and his dream. This should not offend, and yet it does. The real issues may be something other than what you claim. I did post dozens of pictures here, after the event. This picture was one of my favorite. What I did find at the Rally, were people from every persuasion, just like you and I, that feel we are going in a bad direction. We were there to effect change. We did.
The fact that you jump at the chance to make it about Race, is something maybe, to question within yourself. I have over 600 pictures from the Trip. Most of and around the Rally. All different kinds of people from all over. Allot of good will. It was really nice to see that.

How do you mean? I don't see how this only covers the WH. It's a chart that tracks spending, divided by who was president.
 
 
 
 
 
Who controlled Congress for almost all of 2001-2007? Republicans. And they were out of control. Because Bush didn't control them with his veto pen.

Republicans did also control Congress from 1995-2001, but was controlled by Bill Clinton.

 

but that chart only covers the white house
so it is dishonest
even you gotta see that

 

Nor would an honest person claim that anyone had control over the Senate during the Bush years.

 

What does THAT mean?
 
 
In all things there is spin, there are also good people coming from different perspectives representing who they are, as individuals, it is wrong to run from the truth of that. The most important thing we each have to offer the whole is individual perspective. Why obstruct that? Haven't we had enough repression already? Yes or No? Why were Blacks discouraged from attending the 8/28 Rally? What does that say about the Blacks that came anyway?
 
 
Have you heard the latest? Looks like ol' Hayley has been using state funds and planes to go to football games and boxing matches and fancy hotels - none of it involving state business. To the tune of over $500,000!!!

Go get him teabaggers!!!!!

The Senate was virtually split down the middle with no power to accomplish much of anything. One would think that after 8 years it was obvious. At one point we even had Joint Chairmanships, correct?

How about you work on your own laundry list. One would think that life had no meaning before you came along to instruct us? Where there is wrong doing there should be consequence, it is a matter of Justice, not Politics.

Accusing the left of playing the race card every time another rightwing pol gets busted has become its own card.
 
 
Oh, btw, if Barbour didn't do anything wrong, why did he run away from what he said?

Wait a minute - Republicans passed the Bush tax cuts by the skin of it's teeth: by Reconciliation (Republicans HATE Reconciliation, we've recently been told), having Dick Cheney come out of his undisclosed location to break the Senate tie.

So don't tell me Republicans couldn't get anything done in the Senate for 8 years.

Of course he happens to be from Texas, and you know what my thoughts are on folks from Texas.

 

You hate them because most of them are white?

I think most of them are Mexicans. But Texas is not African-American-free by any stretch. And a whole bunch of them moved there from N.O. after Katrina.

The Tea Party is a relatively new movement Marc. You seem real judgmental there, you should check your premise. Injustice comes in all shapes and sizes, there is little immune to it, on either side of the aisle, on either side of the tracks, you might want to consider that. There are all different kinds of Klan's, I don't condone any of them, how about you? Are you capable of seeing People for who they are, Individually? Are you capable of judging people on individual merit? That is something we all need to work on. The Tea Party did contribute to allot of house cleaning in the RNC, it will effect the DNC also in time. It ain't perfect, but who is?

Actually it doesn't phase me in the least, neither do I have any interest in obstructing due process. Can you say that about Charlie Rangel? Stop acting like your shit don't stink.   ACORN? William Jennings "Bill" Jefferson?

The Tea Party has been around since Bush II's days if not before. This they've claimed themselves. You'll have to forgive me if I seem judgmental, which I am, because many in the current Tea Party has implied, suggested and/or outright stated that they are not interested in working with or participating with The Dems, as their views are too far removed from them. Therefore the TeaBaggers are simply the RepubliCON$ in disguise. You know...that crop of CON$ that were embarrassed by the Bush Regime record so changed their name and went into hiding until its safe to come out of the closet as a Full On RepubliCON. On top of that, they haven't shown their willingness to work with Dems either...only to stop them by any means and at any cost.

Moreover, I'm not convinced that the Baggers have cleaned the RNC of anything of significance...if anything they've added more loons and given more "credence" for lack of a better word to FarReicht loons. A platform, yeah...that's the word. They've given the loons of the Reich a platform.

In short...I don't by their schtick, nor your excuse of them either. Sorry.

The Tea Party is Anti Statist. In a Perfect world I'd probably call myself a Constitutional Democrat, but the World is not a perfect place. Statism is Soft Tyranny. All Soft Tyranny's turn into Hard Tyranny's. I will never get past that. That is me Personally. When you are trashed for being an individual, for standing on your own ideas, rather than trading in Conscience to fit in, you will see it differently. I find the Tea Party very tolerant of Individual Perspective and witness. When I find it something other than that, I will look elsewhere. Unalienable Right, is about you being empowered and made aware, through thought, word, and action, anything that obstructs that we should each be questioning., in politics, and in life.

Firstly, I thanked you because I believe you are being sincere. Which is more I can say about a lot of people.

I do believe you are wrong about these people, but I believe you are sincere. I believe the Baggers pick and choose what they want to fight for under "unalienable rights." There are lots of individual freedoms for which they seem not to care much about...not the current crop at least.

I think this year we'll see clearly and distinctly what the Tea Party is all about. By the year's end we'll know what they stand for, as a current group. Some political pundits have recently suggested that we'll see fractions of them breaking off in the coming year or two. I tend to agree with that. The current crop are basically Right Wingers, wanting to take back control so they have "taken over" the Tea Party.

Time will tell.

To bring it back to the OP, Haley Barbour is NO Tea Partier. Or do you think he is?
