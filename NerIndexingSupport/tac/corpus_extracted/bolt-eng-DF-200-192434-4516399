As the title says really.

For me, the most underrated is Edward Norton. I think he is absolutely amazing and really brings the art back into acting, especially with American History X and Fight Club.

Most overrated has to be (I expect predictable negs for this) Will Ferrell. All his films bore me to death, primarily due to the fact that they are not funny. He is overrated and stated as being hilarious. I just find him dull and predictable.
 
 
I really don't like Mark Wahlberg  

Edit: wooow all the negativity, each to their own.

Wasn't aware that Will Ferrell was particularly highly regarded?

I know Kevin Spacey is very well respected but I still think he's under rated. I saw him on stage as Richard III and it was maybe the most incredible performance I've ever seen on screen or stage.
 
 
 
I really don't like Mark Wahlberg  

 

Yeah same, I was going to say him before I thought of Will Ferrell. I mean, he's OK, but I really don't think he should be as highly regarded as he is. I just think he is a bit bland. Having said that, Entourage is epic.

I really like Edward Norton in both of those films, although a lot of his characters seem really samey.

The vast majority of people I know find him hilarious and that his movies are comedy genius.
 
 
Agreed with Edward Norton. I'd also say John Cazale, he was an amazing actor whose life was sadly cut short by cancer.
 
 
I'm pretty sure people don't underrate him but Christian Bale is great actor. As for overrated, I hate to say this but Michael Caine, a top bloke with a great career but I just don't seem him as a particularly great actor.
 
 
 
I really don't like Mark Wahlberg  

 

I thought the general consensus was that he's not really a great actor. Though. **** mass opinion. Most people have poor taste. And are stupid. I think that critics and people of good taste think him to be kinda ****ty in most things. Although he was decent enough in The Fighter.
 
 
Megan Fox, she's WAY overrated.

He's pretty good in The Departed too.

Completely agree with Will Ferrell - same character in every single movie. The only film I've ever enjoyed with him in was Step Brothers, and I think that was down to John C. Reilly.

Overated- Jennifer Aniston From Friends

tru dat.

I guess he might just be one of those bros that's been landed with ****ty roles. And I did ****ing detest Brian Cranston based upon watching 2 or 3 episodes of Breaking Bad, and I've got Breaking Bad on in the background now and he's ****ing fantastic.

Ahh sounds amazing, I was gutted I didn't manage to get tickets!
 
 
Underrated- Adrian Brody

Overrated- Brad Pitt.
 
 
A lot of people seem to love Sarah Jessica Parker. She drives me nuts because her acting is the same in every single film.
 
 
I think that Jodie Whittaker is underrated...but thats probably because i'm a little bit in love with her ^^

I think Julia Roberts is fairly overrated

Please quote and explain negs please  
 
 
Kevin Spacey is the best actor I've ever seen (maybe joint with Jonny Depp)

Most overrated (I don't think he's that highly rated but he's in so many films) has to be Nicholas Cage.
 
 
Sean faris

 

Thought he did a great job for Never Back Down
 
 
liam neeson is underrated i feel.
 
 
 
Underrated- Adrian Brody

Overrated- Brad Pitt.

 

+rep but for your photo of Frank Turner, love love love

I also think Edward Norton deserves more credit, and I hate Nicholas Cage and Jim Carrey, grrr.
 
 
Kate winslet i feel is underrated actress and overrated actress has to angelina jolie.
 
 
Overrated: Keanu Reeves.

He's been in a few decent films, but he can't actually act, he's just the same in everything.
 
 
 
I really don't like Mark Wahlberg  

 

 

I'd like a reason for this blasphemy please  

 
 
 
 
liam neeson is underrated i feel.

 

I like all his films but he is very similar in everything
 
 
 
Kevin Spacey is the best actor I've ever seen (maybe joint with Jonny Depp)

Most overrated (I don't think he's that highly rated but he's in so many films) has to be Nicholas Cage.

 

I love Nicholas Cage  
 
 
 
I love Nicholas Cage  

 

The man doesn't know the meaning of the word act... He is in a few good films but he never carries the movie. He is just SO wooden it's unreal
 
 
Jennifer Aniston, she's annoying and virtually the same character in every film she's in  
 
 
Overrated: Johnny Depp. He plays the same "I'm a weirdo" character. The one movie where he didn't really, Public Enemy, he was so utterly **** and boring that I never even finished it.

Underrated: Keanu Reeves. That man is a brilliant actor, and people just don't seem to appreciate it because they view Neo as a plank of wood, forgetting that the character was meant to be like that.

I'm the only person I know that likes him. I can't explain it, I love all of his films (minus ghost rider   ).
 
 
 
Ahh sounds amazing, I was gutted I didn't manage to get tickets!

 

I was extremely lucky to get tickets tbh. It was justifiably sold out months in advance. I've seen a lot of great films and quite a few great plays but I don't think I've seen many performances as stunning as Spacey's Richard III (it was directed fantastically by Sam Mendes which helped of course!). He delivered humour, pathos, anguish, despair, fear and greed all with equal brilliance. The whole thing lasted more than 3 hours, and even in the last half an hour or so that builds up to the Battle of Bosworth not one person moved from the edge of their seat. I've never seen anything like it. I would happily see it several times more if I could, and that's a rare thing to say about something that lasts so long and is so intense. Despite not being as prolific as them yet, Spacey's definitely right up there with Olivier, Gielgud, Burton and O'Toole as one of the greatest modern Shakespearian actors. I think Spacey's one of those actors whose talents can't quite be seen to their full extent in ordinary movies; you need to see him in this sort of role, as a Shakespearian protagonist, to realise his full capabilities.

 
That was amazing. Someone told me some people had been saying he wasn't good, but I thought he was fantastic.

 

Who told you that?? Maybe they didn't understand the play itself, or lost interest half way through? I still find it surprising because, even to me, someone who's unfamiliar with the play, it was absolutely riveting throughout and both the events themselves and the character of Richard were very easy to relate to. Maybe that's testament to how good Kevin Spacey and Sam Mendes were, perhaps.
 
 
I know he's won an Oscar but I love CUBA GOODING JR!

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnCMqr1QRQw 
 
 
 
I love Nicholas Cage  

 

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzrDpj6M1ig 

Personally:
Overrated - Mark Wahlberg
Underrated - Geoffrey Rush: He had the best performance in "the king's speech", too bad he didn't win an oscar for it.
 
 
 
liam neeson is underrated i feel.

 

i think hes wildly overated- he only has one emotion
 
 
 
A lot of people seem to love Sarah Jessica Parker. She drives me nuts because her acting is the same in every single film.

 

I can't even bare to see her - I just want to pick up the nearest heavy object and throw it at the TV!!

AAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH
 
 
justin Timberlake = Just stick to ****ing singing you camp bastard.

I will never betray him.
 
 
Under rated - Benedict Cumberbatch

Saw in him Frankenstein as the Creature, utterly amazing.

Also a few months later in a documentary-drama abotu Van Gough.

Both challenging roles to play and very well done.
 
 
Underrated: Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman, such diverse actors who have played so many diffferent roles, especially Oldman who many people don't acknowledge, I say Gary Oldman and my friends are like: "Who?" and only recognise him by face when I saw who he has played.

Overrated: Tom Cruise, he's done good films in the past, but now it seems he just churns out pointless hollywood action films, Knight and Day was terrible.
 
 
Overrated - Jason Statham

He just brings out the same **** over and over
 
 
Underrated: Zach Braff, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, Heath Ledger - has done some incredible films that nobody has ever seen.

Overrated: Kristen Stewart, Megan Fox, Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz
 
 
 
Overrated - Mark Wahlberg
Underrated - Geoffrey Rush: He had the best performance in "the king's speech", too bad he didn't win an oscar for it.

 

I hate Wahlberg, I can't stand watching him, yet everyone loves him. And Rush: YES! Such a good actor, Captain Barbossa and he was in 'Elizabeth' and 'Finding Nemo.'  
 
 
 
Underrated: Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman.

 

I came on here to say exactly that :')

Far too many of my friends don't know who Alan Rickman is either, I always just end up sighing and saying 'Snape.'
 
 
Underrated: Michael Fassbender, Hugo Weaving, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney
Overrated: Sarah Jessica Parker, Hugh Grant, Tom Cruise, Megan Fox
 
 
under-rated = sean bean
 
 
 
Underrated: Zach Braff, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, Heath Ledger - has done some incredible films that nobody has ever seen.

how is Heath Ledger underrated?
 
 
 
under-rated = sean bean

 

I thought you had written over-rated

my face was   and I was going to rant  
 
 
Overrated: Nicholas Cage, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Megan Fox (I'm sure they're all lovely people but their acting isn't brilliant), Charlie Sheen, Mel Gibson

Underrated: Alan Rickman, Hugo Weaving
 
 
Michael Cera - Same character in every film.

Overrated as f***
 
 
 
Overrated - Jason Statham

He just brings out the same **** over and over

 

My mum absolutely loves him but all he does is kick people in the head and drive fast cars, I wouldn't call it acting lol.

Definitely agree with you on Gary Oldman, can't wait for his performance in 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'. Loads of people don't recognise the name because he generally tries to shy away from public life.
 
 
underrated - Ryan O'neal
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KyBdPeKHg 

really moving  
 
 
Two most overrated actresses IMO are Megan Fox and Kristen Stewart.
Megan is beautiful but not that great an actress, Kristen pulls THE most annoying faces in Twilight and constantly sighs/huffs and puffs. Annoying ****.
 
 
Emily Watson is very underrated. Watch Breaking the Waves people! She was a force of nature in that film.

Annette Bening is also underrated I feel.

I really like Hilary S**** but I think she's a bit overrated. She definitely deserved her first Oscar for Boys Don't Cry but she didn't deserve it for Million Dollar Baby. Kate Winslet should have won for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind!

lol it won't let me put Hilary's last name because it thinks I'm saying ****!  
 
 
 
how is Heath Ledger underrated?

 

In the way I said. In the way that a lot of people only know him from 'The Dark Knight' and people haven't seen some of his best films, like 'Lords of Dogtown'.
 
 
Underated: Will Smith.
 
 
 
Underated: Will Smith.

 

Isn't he one of the biggest earners in hollywood? Is that really under-rated?

Get the **** out of here.
 
 
Godie Hawn is amazing! But today's generation don't appreciate her that much :'(
 
 
I think Jospeh Gordon-Levitt is really talented and doesn't get enough praise.

Nicolas Cage is a joke :|

Zooey Deschanel is a bit over-rated as an actress IMO but she seems lovely
 
 
 
underrated - Ryan O'neal
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KyBdPeKHg 

really moving  

 

He's not as underrated as Eric Freeman, he gives an absolutely menacing performance in Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2...

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7gIpuIVE3k 
 
 
Underrated actress - Yasmin Paige (Maria from SJA, Jordana in Subamarine)
 
 
Underrated - Ralph Fiennes  
Overrated - Will Ferrel - I mean come on, where is the funny??
 
 
 
I hate to say this but Michael Caine, a top bloke with a great career but I just don't seem him as a particularly great actor.

 

Agreed. I actually enjoy watching him in films but he never seems to really be acting... I think just his presence and personality are what's appealing, but yeah, as an actor he's definitely overrated.

Also, Clive Owen... he's ****ing terrible.

As for underrated, Uma Thurman easily. I don't get why she isn't cast more often... Tarantino obviously spotted her talent but other than his films, I can't really think of anything else she's been in that was actually decent.
 
 
 
As the title says really.

For me, the most underrated is Edward Norton. I think he is absolutely amazing and really brings the art back into acting, especially with American History X and Fight Club.

Most overrated has to be (I expect predictable negs for this) Will Ferrell. All his films bore me to death, primarily due to the fact that they are not funny. He is overrated and stated as being hilarious. I just find him dull and predictable.

 

Totally agree with you about Edward Norton. He is also brilliant in The Illusionist and The Painted Veil.

Mostly agree with you about Will Ferrell, although his performance as Mugatu in Zoolander was genius. In my opinion, anyway  
 
 
People are just posting actors and actresses that they like and dislike. No one rates Megan Fox as an actress and she's been in loads of flops, her career is on the slide. Overpaid and overexposed, perhaps. Overrated; no.

Personally I think Zooey Deschanel is overrated, she's always the same Magic Pixie Dream Girl in everything.
 
 
Underrated:

Keanu Reeves
Eddie Murphy
 
 
I think River Phoenix is pretty underrated.
 
 
 
Overrated: Keanu Reeves.

He's been in a few decent films, but he can't actually act, he's just the same in everything.

 

I just see him as Ted in everything. I love him though.
 
 
It worries me how many people think Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman and Edward Norton are underrated. These actors are huge within Hollywood, earn huge sums of money and have international followings. All three of them have won numerous awards, with Norton having been nominated for an Oscar, for Christ's sake.
 
 
I'd say Christian Bale for underrated. When people saw him in Batman, you would think, meh they gave him a very boring actor to act for, pretty straight forward to do, and he got all these plaudits. Then you watch Fighter and The Prestige and think, WOW. Pretty awesome.

Also think Collin Ferrel is underrated. Or is he? Meh I think hes pretty good actor too.

Overrated- Will Ferrel I agree. Hes just not funny.

Very true. I think that goes the same for my choices lol You have to be fairly rated to get all the top awards. And especially afterwards when you think they are "underrated"
 
 
I'm sorry buts it's got to be said. Megan Fox = overrated. Yes she is really pretty but seriously, mediocre acting at best.

Underrated: Eddie Murphy as previously mentioned above.
 
 
I must be one of the only one's but I like Nicholas Cage... As for over-rated, I agree with the general vibe that the likes of Megan Fox, Tom Cruise etc. do not deserve their status'...
 
 
My pick would have to be Andy Serkis AKA Gollum as underrated. He's a genius.
 
 
underrated - tom hardy

some people are saying that an actor/actress is overrated because they play the same character in every film. that doesn't make them a bad actor. it just means that they aren't clever in choosing parts that show versatility. they choose the same roles over and over maybe because they feel comfortable playing a particular kind of character. that doesn't make them bad actors. they just don't take risks.
 
 
 
I must be one of the only one's but I like Nicholas Cage... As for over-rated, I agree with the general vibe that the likes of Megan Fox, Tom Cruise etc. do not deserve their status'...

 

I do like Nicholas Cage, he proved himself as a good actor in Lord of War, but he accepts terrible roles for a lot of Box Office flops. He's got it in him, but I think the roles he's put in don't really allow him to reach his potential
 
 
Thought Edward Norton as i clicked on the thread ;p.
overated: Cameron Diaz, does anyone rate her now though?
underrated: jonathan rhys meyers and cilian murphy.
 
 
Underrated: Gary Oldman and Cillian Murphy

Overrated: Seth Rogan (He's not that bad, just annoying..)

As for Christian Bale, I damned completely agree with people praising him- he's genuinely the only actor I've seen who actually looks as though he's doing the absolute best he can for his art.

I liked him in 'Friends with Benefits'  
 
 
 
Overrated: Seth Rogan (He's not that bad, just annoying..)

 

Ahh come one, the guy's awesome. Every comedy he's been in has been great, there's very few good comedies out there these days

 
I liked him in 'Friends with Benefits'  

 

I haven't actually seen him in anything other than The Social Network, which he was pretty good in. From what I've heard, he's underrated rather than overrated
 
 
tempted to neg you for clouded judgement. I'll opt not to.
 
 
under-rated: Douglad Henshall and Keira Knightley (why does Ross not like her?)
 
 
who ever said Brad Pitt is insane. the guy is so diverse. watch twelve monkeys such a good performance. fight club, burn after reading, inglourious bastards. he does funny so well. crazy brilliant. he is such a greta actor i have never seen him fail in anything.

even when he apperead in friends it was voted best celebrity apperance, man was he funny.

MOST UNDERATED:jason bateman. teh guy is so good at drama but i recently saw the change up and he killed it. i had never seen him in a role that and he was ace, better than reynolds and reynolds is best when playing a douche.
 
 
Orlando Bloom is [or more was nowadays] overrated and got too many jobs based on looks. He is a really **** actor. Although not as bad as Daniel Radcliffe...I guess they thought he'd develop as he grew up...by the 4th/5th film it was a bit late to replace him... hehe

alan rickman is quite underated on a global scale. the other two are far better known than he is
 
 
 
who ever said Brad Pitt is insane.

 

Agreed! Whoever said that, go and watch True Romance... one of my favourite films, got another underrated actor in there (Christian Slater) and Pitt's depiction of a stoner is genius!

Never thought much of him til I saw that.
 
 
Underrated: Kenneth Branagh.
 
 
 
alan rickman is quite underated on a global scale. the other two are far better known than he is

 

Tell that to his numerous awards and his being one of the main actors in one of the biggest movies series of all time. He was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and has been in some of the world's best loved movies.

He is well respected for his talent.
 
 
 
Underrated: Kenneth Branagh.

 

isnt he a director
 
 
 
I really don't like Mark Wahlberg  

 

Have you ever seen Fear or Shooter  

Overrated: Brad Pitt

Underrated: Richard Burton, old school but he was a class act.

yeah but he isnt a box office draw really on a global scale. most of his awards are british one and the film series i assume you are mentioning(Harry Potter?) is british and thats where the majority of people found out about him.

ed norton had american history X(serious drama) but also the incredible hulk(big box office draw)

garu oldam is also in the batman series and harry potter, but has had far more serious things too. i hear his new film is already oscar tipped.

alan is a brilliant actor but those two actors would get named far quiker than him on a global list of great actors

how is bradd pitt overated, he is so diverse and any film he has been in he has pretty much shone
 
 
the ginger lad on coronation street who was in the army has got to be the most hollow actor I've ever seen, even for coronation street.
 
 
Did someone mention Gary Oldman? He's also in True Romance urr... he's like a white black guy, hilarious and psychotic at the same time. Just to mention another guy, Christopher walken is universally appraised for every character he's ever played in any film. Like Michael Caine, his presence in any film is great, but he seems to play the same wooden character.
 
 
I definitely agree with Adrian Brody being under-rated (he's my FAVOURITE actor   ).

I think when people say "under-rated" or "over-rated" they mean the GENERAL public's opinion, not the Academy's views.

George Clooney is over-rated imo. Recently he's been acting well, but every time I watch him I just see "George Clooney acting like an exaggerated version of...George CLooney" and that annoys me more than Hayden Christensen's famous woodenness.
 
 
 
tempted to neg you for clouded judgement. I'll opt not to.

 

If this is directed at me, I appreciate it  

But my judgement's informed, not clouded

That doesn't make him underrated. He is clearly rated quite highly and his role in Dogma is well known and loved.

No one is denying his acting talent. Being unknown on a global scale is not the same to being underrated.

Oh and the Harry Potter were an American/British joint venture. To be pedantic.
 
 
 
His face is too decent for my liking  

 

i have no idea what that means but i respect your opinion either way

also feel johnny depp is overated. he has been tim burtons lacky for years, so gets any great script tim has. he has never wowed me and never will

i concede defeat i forgot Dogma, yes he is pretty highly rated

1 rep to you for showing me the error of my ways.

but johnny depp is overated!

Agreed, I hate Depp.
 
 
I think Jennifer Aniston is very underated. And Johnny Depp is amazing!
 
 
I would have said Ed Norton too, Brad Pitt? I think Leo DiCaprio is starting to get recognition so I won't say him.
Overrated, Johnny Depp? He isn't a bad actor at all though.

Jack Sparrow though? Many a time I've tried to emulate the charm and style he brought to that role, but never been quite able to captivate it in the manner Depp did.  
 
 
Underrated: Ellen Burstyn
Overrated: Leonardo Di Caprio
 
 
Paul Dano is so so so underrated, nobody ever knows him. Such a shame, I think he's brilliant.

Adam Sandler is terrible imo, but apparently he's the fourth highest-paid actor in Hollywood  
 
 
 
A lot of people seem to love Sarah Jessica Parker. She drives me nuts because her acting is the same in every single film.

 

She drives me nuts cause her face looks like a foot..

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfzXU2n9snI 

Underrated: Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson
 
 
Underrated for me goes to Ian Mcshane - he's been around for ever and he's still going.
 
 
Alan rickman is so underrated it's actually a joke!

Credit where credit's due though, how many other horses do you know who've made it to the same level in film as her?
 
 
 
isnt he a director

 

He starred in Hamlet, Much Ado about nothing, Henry V, Frankenstein, Look Back in Anger, Othello, Love's Labour's Lost, and a shamefully minute part in Harry Potter. To mention the notable movies. His acting of Hamlet was the best ever recorded. But he's an amazing stage-play-turned-movie-actor in Every scene that allows him to do any acting at all (I'm referring to his 2-d part in Harry Potter)
Isn't he underrated? he's now known for directing Tron while his magnum opi lay in the dust...
 
 
I know some people might think I'm jumping on the band wagon with this but I think Heath Ledger was one the most diverse and most breathtakingly brilliant actors I've ever seen. When he goes into character you genuinely can't believe that they aren't a real person, you really believe they have a past,present and future. He took acting to "being" and I have never been gutted to know that I won't see anything else from such a wonder professional.
 
 
Also as much as I love David Tennant (and I really do love him), I think his acting skills are incredibly limited.
 
 
 

Unparalleled; I cant think of one film where 'Maaaattt Daaaameeeen' doesnt give a stellar performance  

Oh, and Simon Pegg is extremely overrated as a comedic actor. I dont find him the least bit funny, even when the film has good writing for some reason..
 
 
 
Jack Sparrow though? Many a time I've tried to emulate the charm and style he brought to that role, but never been quite able to captivate it in the manner Depp did.  

 

Don't get me wrong, I love Depp to pieces...
Seems to get into some peoples' best of all time lists though?  

Jack Sparrow is wonderful however, something to behold! Doubt even Nicholas Cage would do outperform him in that role...
 
 
 
Credit where credit's due though, how many other horses do you know who've made it to the same level in film as her?

 

The point of this thread is whether I think she's overraterd or not. Other people in her league like Angelina Jolie and Anne Hathaway, who are actually versatile, are paid the same amount as her or in Anne's case, less.
 
 
Echoing Kristen Stewart as overrated. I'm not a huge fan of Emma Watson, but this picture is incredibly true.

 

Kristen Stewart can't act! Why do they keep giving her roles???
 
 
Underrated - Edward Norton
Overrated - Johnny Depp
 
 
can someone explain to me how you can think Jonny Depp is anything short of genius?
 
 
 
Overrated: Johnny Depp. He plays the same "I'm a weirdo" character. The one movie where he didn't really, Public Enemy, he was so utterly **** and boring that I never even finished it.

Underrated: Keanu Reeves. That man is a brilliant actor, and people just don't seem to appreciate it because they view Neo as a plank of wood, forgetting that the character was meant to be like that.

 

Finding Neverland, Secret Window, From Hell, Chocolat, The Ninth Gate, Dead Man etc. There is more than one film where he hasn't played the "I'm a weirdo" character, just sayin'.

Yeah...I was just making a joke about her looks.

I'll let myself out.

Ahahahaha, really? You think he isn't playing the weirdo in those movies? Kidding yourself.
 
 
 
Ahahahaha, really? You think he isn't playing the weirdo in those movies? Kidding yourself.

 

Even if he does play a lot of weirdos, they're all completely different and weird in different ways

No, they're really not.
 
 
 

Unerrated: River Phoenix. The man is an acting genius and such a legend. Unfortunately, he is now used as an example of how Hollywood kills young talent rather than celebrated for his acting.

 

Overrated: Keira Knightley. Wooden acting and all she does is pout. Very two dimensional and gives no passion towards a role. She seems to always be concious of her outward appearence rather than the inner soul of a character.
 
 
 
No, they're really not.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so they're all exactly the same??

Every single one was pulled of fantastically, and then compared to him in real life, he really really is a fantastic actor

Yes, because the make-up is what makes a character. The make-up and clothes, clearly.

I love how you threw in Dillinger when I've already said he tried playing a normal person there and was crap.  

And yes, within the bounds of the actual character, he plays them all exceptionally similarly. It's boring to watch him. Hell, I could even see Jack Sparrow popping up in Dillinger.

He used to be good, admittedly, but now he's just a one trick pony.
 
 
The most overrated to me is Kristen stewart, she can't act to save her life, When I saw Twilight, I was like omg, why is she there? The most underrated? mmm I still have to think about that
 
 
Whoever said John Cazale is so right. Genuinely one of the greatest losses to cinema ever. He made just 5 feature films in his short career. The Godfather, The Godfather II, The Conversation, The Deer Hunter and Dog Day Afternoon. All oscar nominated, all in the IMDB Top 250 and all considered classics by virtually everyone, and John Cazale had a big part to play in all of these films being great. His portrayal of the pathetic and childlike Fredo in Godfather II is so tragic and memorable. Breaks my heart that so many people don't even know who he is.

As for overrated: Samuel L. Jackson. He's made a career of playing the cool tough guy, but he has no depth and no range. Not saying I don't like him, because I actually do, but he is a one trick pony.
 
 
Most underrated actor is CILLILAN MURPHY. If you haven't heard of him check him out!! He always has minor but EPIC roles: Inception, Batman Begins, The Tron Legacy...I saw him in a main role in Sunshine and he was just awesome. He's probably a very good actor but its his persona and demeanour that just blows me away...he's just an EPIC guy!!

Another underrated actor is Tom Hardy, although he has been gaining a bit of fame recently...

As for overrated: Adam Sandler and Kristin Stewart!! I've seen them in interviews and they behave the exact same way they do in their films! Adam Sandler was not too bad when he was younger but now I can't even picture him having more than two expressions!!
 
 
There is a difference between a movie star and an actor. Some of these movie stars see call themselves an actor and hence are overrated:

The Whole Twilight Ensemble, Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Sarah Jessica Parker and the list is too long and I'm hoping others will add to this list/

Underrated actors:

I feel sorry for Johnny Depp, sinces he has tried and succeeded in a wide variety of roles and is not scared to push boundaries but hollywood and specially the Academy (who half of the members should not be so) don't like the guy.
I agree that DiCaprio has just started getting recognised although he did a lot of great films.
Jeremy Piven is very good at his role in entourage and also smoking aces but I'm yet to see another dimension to him.

I think right now Ellen page is underrated although she is starting to grow.
_________________

With regards to Mark Wahlberg, the guy is a good actor but not great. I think his best work was probably Shooter and Maxpayne was just too painfull to watch.
 
 
Underrated: Tom Hardy
Overrated: Tom Cruise
 
 
Overrated - Kristen Stewart, I think she is one of the most boring, flat actress' ever.
Underrated im not so sure, I would probably agree with those sayin Michael Caine.
 
 
Underrated...

Rufus Sewell. He's a fantastic actor and I don't think gets enough credit.
Mark Strong, likewise.
Megan Follows. Never hear anything about her these days, she's an amazing actress.
John Simm. He's really amazing, but doesn't get quite as much appreciation as someone as awesome as him deserves.

But the winner of the most underrated actress has to be Bertille Noel-Bruneau. She's in the Fox and the Child and is hands down the most convincing child actress I've ever seen. Ever. And she's adorable. Well, she's probably about my age now, but you get the idea.

 

I'll add more as I remember.

Overrated has to be Adam Sandler (I don't like anything I've seen him in, sorry folks. Click especially creeped the hell outta me) and Kristen Stewart (never looks happy, poor girl) and Jennifer Aniston (it's the same character in every film!).

 

No, did I really just say Jennifer Aniston was overrated? Hell yes I did.
 
 
 
Also, Clive Owen... he's ****ing terrible.

 

Clive Owen lives near me, and when he moved here the whole town went insane :| Every time the local paper runs an article about our cinema, they always manage to slip in "Clive Owen, patron saint of the cinema..."
 
 
 
If this is directed at me, I appreciate it  

But my judgement's informed, not clouded

 

Wasn't actually haha, i agree with what you said. Seth Rogen is funny, on discussion.
 
 
Underrated:

Brendan Gleeson
Ruth Wilson

Overrated:

I agree with Adam Sandler, never liked any of the films he's been in.

I was going to say Liam Neeson as well. That man is a god.

Really? I find him overrated, if anything. He only seems to have one facial expression and his acting is often very wooden.

He's the most wooden actor out there IMO. Funny though, Children of Men is one of my favourite films and it happens to have both him and Michael Caine in it  
 
 
Keira Knightley is overrated in my opinion. Underrated actors and actresses include Jim Broadbent, Imelda Staunton, Carey Mulligan.

Eric Cantona is not a bad actor, having seen the play he was in last year in Paris.
 
 
 
He's the most wooden actor out there IMO. Funny though, Children of Men is one of my favourite films and it happens to have both him and Michael Caine in it  

 

He's up there with Keanu Reeves (who I have a soft spot for). I have to say I like Michael Caine, admittedly today he basically plays himself over and over again, but I loved him in 60s films like Alfie or Woman Times Seven.
 
 
Although he is very highly regarded, I would say Christian Bale is hugely underrated.

Denzel Washington is obviously enormously underrated.

Taylor Lautner is overrated in my opinion. Good looking guy, and he seems pretty down to earth, but the trailer for "Abduction"... My god

I really like Nicholas Cage, but he's had a few... moments ("howda geh burr'd? howda geh burr'd!??HOWDA GEH BURR'D HOWDA GEH BURR'D!!!?!?!")
 
 
I don't think either Christian Bale or Denzel Washington are underrated... everyone knows they're awesome

Yeah I do like Michael Caine, but as you say he doesn't seem to vary in character. I'm kinda indifferent to Keanu Reeves, I think he's a good actor but he's neither underrated nor overrated really.

Keanu Reeves is a pretty terrible actor imo, but somehow I find him very interesting as a person.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also a bit underrated, but I'm guessing that's going to change with Inception and now 50/50. He's amazing.

I watched Inception for the first time the other night and recognised him, but I can't put my finger on what other films I've seen him in. I'm thinking some cheesy teen comedy or something, I dunno, but he was decent as was the film.

Inception's overrated though haha

His role in Inception didn't require much acting, he can do much more than that. He has actually starred in a cheesy teen comedy (10 Things I hate about you, lol), but he's done other stuff too, (500) Days of Summer is probably best known.

Spoiler:
If you want to know what he's capable of, watch Brick. Brilliant film, one of my favourites.
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVzHeJ0Z3I 
Much better than Inception  
 
 
Brick is very good, but I think Mysterious Skin is JGL's best performance. Disturbing and shocking film and he was amazing in it.

I've been meaning to watch it, but I'm a bit scared tbh. How disturbing is it?

Have you seen Manic? He's great in that one too.
 
 
 
Yeah same, I was going to say him before I thought of Will Ferrell. I mean, he's OK, but I really don't think he should be as highly regarded as he is. I just think he is a bit bland. Having said that, Entourage is epic.

 

 
I really don't like Mark Wahlberg  

Edit: wooow all the negativity, each to their own.

 

you women never seen the fighter?
 
 
 
And Swordfish. He was really good in that.

I was going to say Liam Neeson as well. That man is a god.

 

Don't forget Pulp Fiction, one of the greatest films ever made  
 
 
I'm gonna throw Brad Dourif into the underrated mix here, apologies if he's already been mentioned. Also Hugo Weaving, outstanding actor. Yes, yes I know, they do have LotR in common  .

Oh and of course, my main man Keanu! (Who sadly, was not in Lord of the Rings.)
 
 
Yeah the LOTR thing, I watched the trilogy the other day (I've had a lot of time on my hands) and it actually hit me how perfectly put together that film is. I couldn't find any flaw other than the cheesy slow-mo shots, which I'm guessing was a directorial decision. All of the actors deserve serious props, so I'll add Elijah Wood to my list. As cringeworthy as certain scenes were, the guy did a stellar job.
 
 
Strangely enough, my views on underrated and overrated actors can be summed up in the Pirates of the Caribbean films.

Overrated: Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. I cannot bear either of them, in any film I've ever seen them in. Except Bend It Like Beckham, she's quite good in that.

Underrated: Johnny Depp. Okay, I know he's like, one of the most famous actors ever, but seriously - he's just SO good, I'm not sure he'll ever be fully appreciated

Domino?  
 
 
 
I think that Jodie Whittaker is underrated...but thats probably because i'm a little bit in love with her ^^

I think Julia Roberts is fairly overrated

Please quote and explain negs please  

 

I'm not going to neg you because it's your own opinion, but I have to disagree with you. I think she's a wonderful actress and even though her films are normally in the romance sector, when she does act in other genres (Charlie Wilson's War, Conspiracy Theory) she does it pretty well so I'd say she's fairly versatile as well.
 
 
Adam Sandler is incredibly over-rated and not even funny. His films make me question his sexuality tbh.

For under-rated I'd say Will Smith believe it or not. He's known for being goofy but not seriously taken as an actor. Just take my word for it. Or watch seven pounds. Epic.

Will Smith is a seriously good actor, at least when it comes to purveying emotion. That bit in I Am Legend where he kills his dog, how could that not get to you?

I think The Persuit of Happyness was his real high point, I very, very rarely cry about anything ever but that film almost got me there.

It's about time he got cast in some far more serious stuff, instead of just cheesy action flicks.
 
 
 
you women never seen the fighter?

 

Yeh I saw The Fighter. I thought it was a good film, but he just didn't stand out that much for me...as in, I could imagine someone else playing that role, and for me, thats what makes an actor really good; if you can't imagine anyone else playing that role.

cinderella man is my favourite boxing film.
 
 
I've just thought of one. Sean Bean. He is incredible in everything he's ever been in.
 
 
Most overrated - Shia LaBeouf.

Have you seen Manic? He's great in that one too.

 

I found it very disturbing, but it's not especially graphic, it's more the themes that are disturbing rather than the actual content. It's definitely worth a watch regardless. Excellent film that will really stay with you.

I started watching Manic, but I bought a used copy of the DVD and after about twenty minutes it decided that there was a scratch on the disc and it didn't work. Have yet to get around to buying a new copy.
 
 
Underrated:

Viggo Mortensen
Richard E Grant
Michael Wincott
Romola Garrai
Gary Oldman
christina ricci

Overrated:

Brad Pitt
Will Smith
Angelina Jolie
Scarlett Johanson

Also I think Kirsten Dunst is an actress that many people unfairly criticise.
 
 
I'm not a huge Anne Hathaway fan; though I did like her in The Devil Wears Prada. (But that was probably more to do with the divine Meryl Streep!)

I think she does better when she is surrounded by strong cast mates (or strong material) i.e. Brokeback Mountain (strong film - but I didn't 'believe' her charater), The Devil Wears Prada, Nicholas Nickleby, etc. When she has to carry a film (or has weaker cast material) the results are not as good, ie: Havoc, Bride Wars, etc...however, people LOVE this woman so her films are somewhat supported. Personally, I think she should stick with what she does best; which is comedy/zany roles.

She has a huge role coming up in The Dark Knight Rises as Catwoman; which I'm hoping she does well in.

As most people would agree, Katie Holmes failed miserably in Batman Begins (almost ruined it for me). And I consider the two of them the same 'type' of actresses as far as acting is concerned (though Hathaway's personality can be zany/bubbly).
 
 
 
I was extremely lucky to get tickets tbh. It was justifiably sold out months in advance. I've seen a lot of great films and quite a few great plays but I don't think I've seen many performances as stunning as Spacey's Richard III (it was directed fantastically by Sam Mendes which helped of course!). He delivered humour, pathos, anguish, despair, fear and greed all with equal brilliance. The whole thing lasted more than 3 hours, and even in the last half an hour or so that builds up to the Battle of Bosworth not one person moved from the edge of their seat. I've never seen anything like it. I would happily see it several times more if I could, and that's a rare thing to say about something that lasts so long and is so intense. Despite not being as prolific as them yet, Spacey's definitely right up there with Olivier, Gielgud, Burton and O'Toole as one of the greatest modern Shakespearian actors. I think Spacey's one of those actors whose talents can't quite be seen to their full extent in ordinary movies; you need to see him in this sort of role, as a Shakespearian protagonist, to realise his full capabilities.

Who told you that?? Maybe they didn't understand the play itself, or lost interest half way through? I still find it surprising because, even to me, someone who's unfamiliar with the play, it was absolutely riveting throughout and both the events themselves and the character of Richard were very easy to relate to. Maybe that's testament to how good Kevin Spacey and Sam Mendes were, perhaps.

 

Sorry to butt in on your conversation, but are you talking about the Richard III play that was showing in Waterloo with Spacey playing Richard III? If so I saw it a few weeks ago and it was absolutely brilliant, Spacey played Richard exactly as had imagined him to be. It was very funny too, Buckingham was also fantastic and the drums added to the build up.
 
 
For me Jim Carey is extremely over rated. He is just too over the top. The only film of his I have enjoyed is the mask.
 
 
On the most part, the actors in the more art films are pretty underrated, and the actors in mainstream Hollywood films are the most overrated (apart from Johnny Depp, he's awesome).
 
 
I would say Dana Delany is the most underrated actress. She was fabulous in Desperate Housewives as Katherine Mayfair, and is even more brilliant in her new role as Doctor Megan Hunt on the hugely underrated drama "Body of Proof".
 
 
I agree that James McAvoy is underrated, as is Maggie Gyllenhaal.
 
 
Underrated- Sean Penn, Edward Norton, Reese Witherspoon (I know she's won lots of awards but I don't think people realise just how good she is).

Overrated- Brad Pitt, Jim Carrey, Will Ferrell, Robert Pattinson, Keira Knightley
 
 
Overrated - Jennifer Aniston. She is exactly the same in every single film. Ever.
 
 
Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whitely wasn't the best actress either, although I'm still waiting for her to get a proper job and not one where you're there to just show off your body and possibly ask a few inane questions.

LOL, you can probably guess that Transformers 3 isn't my most favourite movie.
 
 
The entire Game of Thrones cast is grossly underrated. Soon to change, I hope. Also Paul Dano, who was stunning in There Will Be Blood...
But to me, the one truly underrated actor is Gale Harold.

So many people are saying 'this person... I hate them, they're crap and overrated!'. Apart from singer-turned-actor/ess types such as Miley Cyrus, I don't think many people are that overrated in the industry, at least not to a point I feel I could criticise... originally I wrote Zooey and Keira and Angelina etc, but then I took them away. Because it's an industry where you can't really stop yourself being overrated, if that's what the audiences want. As a Hollywood actor, you strive for media attention, and if you happen to be what the public/papers/producers are wanting, you're hardly going to say 'nah that's fine, I'll grab the next movie and possibly miss out on a great project that I could enjoy, and that lets me do what I love... just because too many people appreciate me'. They're doing what they're doing and what they have always and will always do. There's got to be some reason for people thinking they're amazing - even with Miley, I can understand it because as much as I dislike her persona, she's overrated because she has Disney's entire audience backing her every move. And I'm sure she's earned that much. Guys like Robert Pattinson are probably overrated, but again they're just doing their job as well as they can. He hardly asked for his hair to look so stupid and start so much judgement, just as Taylor whatshisname probably didn't demand terms that included his shirt being off all the time.
I'm in a rambling mood. Later I'll probably come back and say Angelina and Keira etcetc.
 
 
 
Overrated: Keanu Reeves.

He's been in a few decent films, but he can't actually act, he's just the same in everything.

 

He's immortal. That trumps everything  

Overrated:

Zooey Deschanel - Plays the same character in every damn film. Manic Pixie Dream Girl who wears cute vintage clothes. She's cute but cannot act - or sing  

Also Adam Sandler, Seth Rogan, Michael Cera.

Underrated:

Edward Norton! The man is an amazing actor that deserves way more recognition that he is given.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt: He plays such diverse roles! If you don't believe me, watch Brick and Mysterious Skin then get back to me.

Mysterious Skin is one of my all time favourites, and at the time of its release and even just a few years ago I would have paid money to tell people how underrated JGL was. But now I think he has his due recognition. He'll get the roles he wants if they suit him. Any more and people will start saying he's overrated too. >.<
 
 
i think liam neeson is overated....
 
 
Underrated:

Sean Bean (I know he is kinda famous but damn it he needs to be more famous.)
Edward Norton

Overrated:

Brangelina.
George Clooney
 
 
I think David Wenham is really underrated, but I suppose that's because he's always in supporting roles.
 
 
Miley Cyrus is UNDER RATED.
She is one of the best actresses of our generation yet she goes unnoticed.

Lol, just joking.
 
 
Has anyone said Tim Curry? I think he's very underrated and criminally under-used.
 
 
Also for under-rated: Willem Dafoe.
 
 
Kiera Knightley. She's pretty but.. Bleh.
 
 
 
Under rated - Benedict Cumberbatch

Saw in him Frankenstein as the Creature, utterly amazing.

Also a few months later in a documentary-drama abotu Van Gough.

Both challenging roles to play and very well done.

 

Couldn't agree more but I think next year with Sherlock and The Hobbit more people will appreciate his awesomeness

Yes indeedy, also i think recently with the release of TTSS he's getting more coverage for his talent. Yay  
 
 
Nicholas Cage is over-rated far too much, listening and watching him "act" is as fun was watching paint dry. His monotone voice and lack of any emotion ruins ANY film he's in.

Sean Bean though is an under-rated actor, by a country mile.
 
 
I wholeheartedly agree with everyone who's said that Adam Sandler is overrated - I'm aware that some actors get typecast, but he plays the exact same character in every movie!
 
 
Underrated - Sam Worthington. He's not versatile by any means, but he definitely has the action-man appeal and I'm surprised he hasn't landed more leading roles.

Overrated - Whoever the hell plays River Song. I have no idea why she receives so much praise, her lame attempts at cocky, witty humour bore me and make me want to bury my face in my hands.
 
 
Sam Worthington pleeease. Hes overrated, I don't know how he keeps getting movies when he can barely act.

Sam Rockwell and James Gandolfini are horrendously underrated, Rockwell is brilliant in loads of films but never gets the recognition espicially with awards. And if you don't know Gandolfini, he played Tony Soprano in The Sopranos and its probably one of the greatest acting performances ever in the history of anything, ever.
 
 
 
I really like Edward Norton in both of those films, although a lot of his characters seem really samey.

 

You should see The Illusionist. Excellent performance.
 
 
Underrated-
Edward Norton
Joseph Gordon-Levitt
Ellen Page
Carey Mulligan
 
 
 
Wasn't aware that Will Ferrell was particularly highly regarded?

I know Kevin Spacey is very well respected but I still think he's under rated. I saw him on stage as Richard III and it was maybe the most incredible performance I've ever seen on screen or stage.

 

Kevin Spacey, I LOVE him.
 
 
I don't understand why everyone is saying that Ed Norton is underrated. Have you ever heard anyone say a bad word about his acting? He's rated very highly. Being underrated means that when you say their name a lot of people disagree with you.

To me someone who is underrated is Ryan Reynolds; he's been in some terrible films and really has a bad reputation but with a film like Buried he showed that he is prepared to take risks and can give good performances.
