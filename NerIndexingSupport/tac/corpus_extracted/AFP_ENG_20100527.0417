The Austrian central bank, OeNB, said Thursday that it is now wholly state-owned
after shareholders at its general meeting voted to transfer their remaining
30-percent stake to the Austrian state.

"The general meeting approved the transfer of the shares of all remaining
shareholders to the Republic of Austria," OeNB said in a statement.

The state already held 70 percent of OeNB's capital, with the other 30 percent
held by groups such as Raiffeisen Zentralbank and the insurer UNIQA.

At the same time, central bank chief Ewald Nowotny said OeNB posted an operating
profit of 318 million euros (390 million dollars) in 2009, up from 47 million
euros a year earlier.

Of this, 272 million euros would be transferred to state coffers, OeNB said.
