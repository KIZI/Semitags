Everton were unable to persuade Fenerbahçe to sell Stephen Appiah, the
midfield player, and their attempts to sign Juan Román Riquelme, the
Villarreal midfield player, also fell short

Everton £24.25m

IN Leighton Baines (Wigan Athletic, £5m), Thomas Gravesen (Celtic, season
loan), Phil Jagielka (Sheffield United, £4m), Lucas Jutkiewicz (Swindon
Town, £1m), Steven Pienaar (Borussia Dortmund, season loan), Stefan Wessels
(FC Cologne, season loan), Yakubu Ayegbeni (Middlesbrough, £11.25m).

OUT Anderson Silva (Barnsley, month loan), James Beattie (Sheffield United,
£4m), Stephen Connor (Partick Thistle, loan till Jan), Gary Naysmith
(Sheffield United, £1m), Scott Phelan (Bradford City, free), Alessandro
Pistone (released), Richard Wright (West Ham United, free).

Oh well. All in all, I reckon the squad is slightly stronger. We've
got someone who we know can create from midfield. We've got an
excellent looking all-rounder in Jags and our new left back looks
superb. The juries out on the Yak and Pienaar, but they both posses
good stats and if they want their profile raising they must perform
well.

Not bad. A net spend of £19.25m doesn't seem over the top for the
players we've brought in. Let's hope it all gels.

I think the OP and your sums are awry. Forgetting loans (in which
you've done quite well imo) your net spend is £16.5m (£21.25 out, £5
in). Not bad considering you still had money to spend but couldn't
land your target. We spent £44m and raked in £24.5m (loans and
undisclosed deals omitted, both in and out), only £3m more than you,
believe it or not.
Still silly money but what's pleasing is how these new players are
performing, for both clubs. Nothing worse than buying shite, is there?

Hmmm. I just did the maths on our players and you are absolutely bang
on. I just took the total in the article as read.

 

I've been impressed so far. It's still very early doors though.
