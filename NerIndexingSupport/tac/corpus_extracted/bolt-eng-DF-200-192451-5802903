Because those 3 are reasonably trustworthy countries...Iran is not

Because it will destabilize the whole region resulting in an arms race by all the other middle eastern countries. You will then have a nuclear Jordan, a nuclear Syria... This would inevitably lead to a devastating conflict. Iran should not be allowed nuclear weapons at any cost.
 
 
No in the sense that no-one should.

Yes in the sense that it impractical to disarm them and who says that we are right apart from us. They have as much right to nuclear weapons as Britain or Pakistan.

Why is iran deemed 'untrustworthy'?
 
 
I don't believe any state should hold in its possession such weapons. But suffice to say, many do and many continue to develop them. I don't see why a particular state therefore isn't allowed all of a sudden, its unlikely any state would ever use it anyway. The whole concept of nuclear weapons is a paradox. However they are there to act as some kind of psychological deterrent rather than an offensive tool.

People will have their views, opinions and comments to the contrary though in regards to Iran - fuelled by some kind of belief that Iran would deploy such weapons to "wipe Israel off the map". However the ill-informed will remain ignorant enough to believe media tails. Anyone who has taken an interest to the Iranian President and actually read what he has said will realise he wouldn't launch a radioactive weapon of death into a country that borders Palestine; much alone risk the wrath of the international community.
 
 
Really we should all be slowly moving towards disarmament. (Second pillar of the NPT). I do beleve they have the right to nuclear technology for peaceful uses (power). Although it is interesting to note that India, Pakistan and Israel all possess nuclear weapons while not being official Nuclear Weapon States, yet receive very little grief for this.
 
 
No One Should!!

If anything it will stabilise the region, Iran is a middle east super power and with nuclear capabilities it would bring security.

Many countries in the ME are allies of Iran, if anything Iran having nukes will stop their search for the weapons.

The ME countries don't feel safe with pakistan having the weapons and saudi developing them.

Israel has destablisied the region, if Iran had nuclear capabilities, then Israel would be a little more moderate in it's foreign policies.

Or more importantly why is Israel considered trustworthy.
Or Pakistan for that matter.
 
 
I personally don't think the Iranian leadership is responsible enough with these weapons. I know not all nuclear states right now are responsible, but why do we need another irresponsible one?

I do see your point, but with agressive ICBM tests by Iran late last year, the notion that stability will come as a result of Iran achieving nuclear status is pretty flawed. As it stands Israel is the domiant country in the region, which although this causes huge resentment by other ME countries, it is safer than 2 rival countries with nuclear weapons.

It really is not worth the risk letting Iran have nukes, since that would only increase the chances of a nuclear disaster in the region. There is only room for one nuclear power in the ME and thats Israel, since 'its' nukes are sponsored by the US.
 
 
iran should become nuclear power because it will stablize middle east that is israel will not attack palestine.Like india is hassitating in attacking pakistan

People think that being an islamic republic is a bad thing, in fact if the whole world was one big islamic republic, i would garantee you there would be no wars. Even if Ahmadinejad wanted to "wipe israel off the map" which he doesn't (there is no such phrase in persian, the phrase is actually "zionism will vaish from the pages of time" and even that was in regards to peace) The supreme leader would do no such thing.

Iran signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty and it is bound by it.

I won't even entertain suggestions of the merits of Iran having nuclear weapons - they are irrelevant. What is relevant is the fact that it would be illegal for them to do so.

that would be the same india and pakistan who have been at a constant brink of war with each other since partition!!

To the OP- i'm not sure
theres something to be said for having another nuclear power in the region to counteract israels dominance and frankly i even pretty much trust President Ahmadinejad but i'm not sure the country will remain politically stable enough for it to be safe in the long term

Well it's a good thing that he wouldn't have the nuke then isn't it.
 
 
I laugh at some teenager and nitwit Western politicians and media personalities.

They talk as if they are in any position to 'disallow or allow' anything to anybody, let alone to Iran.

Iran can conventionally wipe off all life forms from "Israel" as can Syria+Egypt. "Israel" is in possession of nuclear weapons, so the hypocrisy by the West's questions and some teenagers are easy to see.

why do you think the country will no remain policitically stable? and have ou seen how unstable pakistan is?

Well we survived 8 years with George W. in charge of one of the biggest stockpiles

...... and he has actual little power in Iran, especially when it comes to nuclear, defense and the military.... but of course you knew that  
 
 
I didn't vote.

The poll options are too limited to make an accurate poll.

It should have included who are nonIranians to decide Iran's actions.
 
 
I think all countries should move towards disarmament however when the rest of the world posses them it's tad hypocritical for them to say "No! Bad Iran how darest thou! Ignore the fact we have them, you're not allowed!"

One can hardly call Pakistan a stable country yet it possesses nukes, sure the government is fairly secular at the moment but it wouldn't take much for a shift to occur. Thus the argument that other countries are more stable is a non issue in this debate.
 
 
It will compromise Israeli security and therefore will not be allowed to happen...
 
 
None of you mentioned that the ONLY instance of nuclear weapons being used (in fact on civilians) was by the USA.

FACT!

While some moron only drew some caricature (using artificially concocted statements attributed to Ahmadinejad) and used that as basis for judgment!

who are school teachers to tell pupils they can't carry knives in school? there's gang members outside who carry them, perhaps it would help keep things safer as regards the gangs if every kid in the UK was armed with a blade..?

Not true. Three countries did not sign the NPT: India, Israel and Pakistan. North Korea have apparently attempted to 'withdraw' now.

i wasn't going to say anything, but i guess i have to:

Hezbolla defeated Israel in 06, and it seems that hamas isn't doing too badly this time around.

All israel can do is pay politicians in america to impose sanctions in Iran, which they already have.

Many things compromise Iran's security. Does that mean THEY should not be allowed?

Pupils are meant to learn.
Teachers are meant to teach.
Thus the relationship follows.

Back to the topic, again who are non Iranians to tell Iranians what to do?

yes to make things fair. No because NO COUNTRY should have them
 
 
Hell no....

What are countries thinging about when they create weapons of mass destruction?

That is so naive. What other countries have conflicting interests with America who would be willing to support Iran for their own benefit? And its not just one..

I feel really bad about saying this, becaase so many people are dying, but hamas will not be destroyed, as long as there are people in palestine able to fight, they will fight.

Israel could have done a better job by simply giving palestinians simple human rights and the truce wouldn't have ended.

but let's not get involved in that, i hate it when every thread gets derailed and israel discussions start.

Well what I was trying to get at is America and Israel don't trust Iran and even then if things do compromise Iranian securtiy, who frankly cares about it apart from Iranians. Iran will not be allowed to build up nukes. America have stated this...

To withdraw, you mean? No, they don't have any 'right' except under strict conditions: which they have not met.
 
 
Can I just say, whatever the outcome of this Israel-Hamas war, Iran's been the real winner. As they were in Iraq.

Yes lets not go off topic but I agree in that Israel have gone completely the wrong way about it. Going into Palestine and killing as many Hamas members as possible is only a short term fix. They will be replaced with others...

lol, my Father said the exact same thing.

Iran has also benefited from Afghanistan.
 
 
If Iran isn't, no one should be allowed either. What right does America have to dictate to other countries who is allowed and not allowed to have nuclear weapons, considering the Yanks are the only ones who have ever even used them. Also, don't start that old ***** about "wiping Israel off the map", I will go into it in greater detail if you want, but to breifly cover it, "to wipe off the map" isn't even an idiom in Persian, so he couldn't possibly have even said it.
 
 
For all those saying "Israel shouldn't be trusted"; they didn't use their weapons in two wars. They, IIRC have a procedure for when it may be used and it's only as the last resort.

Sophistry, throw it into the flames!

It's not even a short term fix, it has made everything worse, and the Hamas members are innocent civillians.

Only nine Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigade members have died (they're the ones firing the rockets) every time one of them have died, 20+ innocent civilians have died too.
 
 
Has Folderol heard of the Samson option?

Your father is a very wise man.  
Israel's finished. They've lost all the sympathy they got from the Holocaust. Because they're now deliberately murdering children.
This whole siege has simply radicalised Arab hatred for Israel.
This means Iran has a lot more support in the region now.
And last but not least, they've diverted attention from their nuclear ambitions.
This has ultimately been a very shameful defeat for Israel - it's simply exposed their weakness.

Hamas isn't going to get crushed, the Israeli Defence Forces have stated that they have no intention of removing Hamas from power they're just trying to destroy the rocket launching sites and factories.

A couple of months from now Hamas will still be in power, and you can bet your bottom dollar they'll trump their survival as a victory.

What im trying to say is that the issue not to entirely security related. Its more about business and there are countries who will gain something through alliance with Iran. Why do you think America didn't repeat what they did to Iraq last year, especially when they were at the peak of their power - they knew other parties would interfere.

And my personal opinion: America can't be seen as much of a threat when they can't hold off children firing rusty AK's; they were nearly struggling in Iraq.

Lebanon (Hezbollah but they practically control Lebanon now anyway) and Syria.

But what I meant by support was the PEOPLE in the countries, not just the governments. The Iranians (a non-Arab country) are doing what the Arabs should be doing. It's their OWN PEOPLE. But the Persian Gulf states are refusing to place an oil embargo, for example, on the West. Drives me mad

There are currently 189 countries party to the treaty, five of which have nuclear weapons: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and the People's Republic of China (the permanent members of the UN Security Council)

Mmmm Iraq's a bit unstable now, so it'd be Shi'ite groups, maybe the Mahdi Army, as opposed to the Iraqi army. Iran would just cause havoc in the Middle East, they have their fingers in many pies haha.

And Algeria's a dodgy one aswell, although they have good relations with Iran they'd be reluctant to intervene in any military conflict.

Well that's the problem there's no unity in the middle east. If there was people could make a stand...
 
 
What about USA, the only country to have used it on civilians, "Israel" the only one in possession of the Samson Doctrine/Option, UK/France with their respective colonial histories
And the list goes on.

You know what I think? Even if Israel gave all the land to the Palestinians there'd still be conflict somewhere haha. It's just Middle Eastern nature I think. It's so crazy  
 
 
No..
They have a violent, lunatic as a leader. I don't trust them at all.
 
 
Guys, we're kind of going off topic. so let me conclude this israel situation for you.

Israel will never win in Gaza, please read this quote:

 
Israel evaluates at 40,000 the number of fighters now in the brigades, and claim they receive extensive training as well as more sophisticated weapons, including long-range rockets as well as guided anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles.
 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-...assam_Brigades 

with this attack, many more people are joing the birgades, and only nine of the brigade members have died!

Frankly, israel is loosing, they have lost a drome, an apache helicopter and a tank including a high ranking officer.

Israel lost the war politically and in real terms the minute it invaded. They could have easily stopped the rockets entering their country, by not violating human rights in Gaza, there was a 6 month truce that israel broke, the truces only conditions were that the palestinians were given basic human rights, and israel couldn't even do that!

I don't even think israel wants to save it's civillians, without the rockets, it has no reason to steal land, israel has enough defence systems to destroy the rockets in the air but it chooeses not to.

Now, back on topic.

No, the "middle east" was a term coined to locate the area where most of the earths oil is. Of course there is going to be conflicts where most of the earths oil is, who is behind the conflict though?

America has behind every single one of those conflicts, and the sooner Iran developes nukes, the sooner the conflicts will end.

Many middle eastern countries are strictly under the influence of America. Israel is clearly under their control and so are many other countries. Those who are not, need defence so they are not 'bullied' by those who are. America have targeted the middle east because the region is rich in Oil, starting with the attack of Iraq with the intention of later invading Iran. Control over these countries would help towards domination of the area, and therefore more oil.

No, three religions came from Asia.

The middle east was coined to describe the countries that were oil rich.

what i'm trying to say is, there is always going to be trouble in the middle east because it is oil rich, and america wants that oil.

The Middle East is a region within Asia and sometimes includes North Africa.

Judaism = Israel/Palestine
Christianity = Israel/Palestine
Islam - Arabia

Zoroastrianism = Persia (the first monolithic religion that influenced Judaism and in turn influenced Christianity and Islam)

They're all Middle Eastern love.

Middle Eastern culture is different to other Asian culture so it makes perfect sense to have a separate name for the region

look, here you said it's in the middle eastern nature, and i disagreed with you: i said that it's not in our nature, but because we're oil rich, there is conflicts, i also said that the term middle east was coined to describe oil rich countries.

now please stop going off topic.

lol, i linked to 5 different news sites, and they sayi'm misinformed, two of those sites were israelie, the rest were bbc, msnbc and cnn.

Like i said before, what i said was a "lie" because it disagreed with israel.

Just because you may source one of your claims doesn't mean the rest of your post is right. I bet that your stuck in your ways that your less than reluctant to rad the referenced post.

Yeah, but in turn Persian / Central Asian is (quite a lot, correct me if I'm wrong!) different to Arab, which in turn is quite different to Turkish...

Anyway, I digress.

I voted yes, for pretty much the same reasons as already posted.

Seeing as this thread as (inevitably) turned to Israel/Palestine, I'd like you all to have a look at this blog:  here . The blog was made by a lecturer who came as a guest to Sheffield a few months ago to talk about Palestine.
 
 
I didn't make any claims, apart from the one that i used 5 sources to back.
 
 
I dont think Iran should have nuclear weapons, as i dont think anyone should. Its a shame that someone makes a choice to whether they should be 'allowed' to or not. But they are not seeking to make nuclear weapons, simply nuclear power so that they develop like the west did.
 
 
I don't think any nation should possess them, and I don't like the idea of Iran having them. BUT in times like these, would i blame them for making them? No.

My reasons for them not having them are mostly because it will trigger an arms race in the ME. If Iran has one, Saudi and Egypt would want one. You can't have a Shi'ite bomb and not a Sunni one after all.

Then you'll have Turkey which is quite advanced militarily anyway.

lol, come on, you're Iranian, we're very sly people, i don't think for a second that our nuclear ambitions are domestic.

By the way, would you mind me asking what school you went to, if not what city, i think i may know a friend who knows you (if you're results are real, that is   )

In reply to question in original post:

Why not? and who is entitled to allow or forbid?

Yes, it would make the international situation (seemingly) more volatile. But morally and logically that is no reason to stop a new state from developing that technology. USA, Russia, so on, so forth, Israel, China, so on, so forth, a privileged circle have nuclear weapons. Are they 'allowed'? Why? Are they really more trustworthy and more rational than any other country that might want nuclear weapons now?
In my eyes, that clearly makes them key players when it comes to influence. If they're threatening in that way, all the other key players need to take them seriously. The bigger the circle of key players, the less privileged the members of the circle.
If hundreds of states obtain possession of nuclear weapons, of course to the average Joe an Armagheddon seems unavoidable, but is that really what the USA and Russia and other nuclear states have in mind when they try to prevent anyone else from producing nuclear weapons? If yes, then I must be naive, cause here I was thinking that they only care about the economic and political privileges they now posses and could stand to lose.
There's no point in thinking that weapons are bad, and therefore we should just say No,no,no by default. They exist and a good number of countries are constantly using them in negotiations, even though they don't launch them.

I won't accept the fact that 'Iran would probably use them against Israel' as an argument. The only reason why Israel got them in the first place is to use them against the surrounding countries. Why should Israel be entitled to them? Is this state more special than any other one?
The governments don't have real security concerns, because nobody(except the USA in WWII) would be idiotic enough to launch them. Nuclear weapons are for milking economic and political advantages from states that don't have them. yet.

P.S. I am an anarchist and a pacifist. And a non-hippiotic-hippie. But I am also against legalized black-mailing at global level.
 
 
As far as I’m aware Iran is a hostile nation, so they should not have nukes.

Persian culture is different to Central Asian culture.

Persian, Arab, Turkish, Kurdish, Assyrian, and to a certain extent Armenian culture are all very similar.
 
 
Who decides who's allowed what? Which country or conglomerate of countries has the authority, the strength of morality, to decide who is entitled to nuclear weapons? Should it be the West, led by America, the only nation to have ever used a nuclear weapon - and arguably then unnecessarily? Should it be the UN, the typical 'sit on your arse and pretend the world isn't real' society? No-one can answer this question, I feel. If Iran creates nuclear weapons separate of every other nation then it has earned the right to them through sheer ingenuity. I wouldn't trust the powers that be in Iran with nuclear weapons any more than I would trust anybody else.

I don't think Iran's any more likely to start a nuclear war than anyone else simply because the consequences are too severe.

Oh right, well - I just grouped Central Asia (meaning Samarqand and things, not Mongolia!   ) together with Persia... I could be wrong, but I swear most of central asia is part of "greater iran"
 
 
You don't let potential enemies get badass guns. ******* steamroll Iran if they try.
 
 
Should Israel be allowed to do this though, even though it goes against the Geneva convention?  http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-174565 
 
 
Its only a matter of time before terrorists get hold of nukes.
 
 
The possession of nuclear weapons should be a crime for every nation on earth, but since nuclear prohibition is not gonna happen IMHO every nation should be entitled to possess them to insure their sovereignty.

One notable terrorist nation already has them.

(Israel, for those of who didn't get it)
 
 
I don't think iran would be much of a threat if they had nuclear weapons, but they're far more likely to sell them to people who would be a threat, so no, i don't think they should...

No. The less countries the better.
 
 
I am not entirely comfortable with any nation having nuclear weapons whether that be Iran or the UK.

I also think it is unfair for a particular country or body to decide who can have nuclear weapons and who can't. The ruling party in Iran and there leader make it very hard for anyone to "allow/except" the fact that Iran can have the weapons.

Also why do we need theses weapons? - Imagine a few years down the line a particular party/terrorist organisation gets there hands on the weapons, the consequences could be dire. Why have something that is so dangerous to us? - its more of a fashion trend to have it and test it just to let others now you do have it.
 
 
No. No one should be allowed to have nuclear weapons.
 
 
Yes. If one nation is 'allowed' to have them, all nations should be 'allowed'.

Absolutely and utterly no, as I believe the country would use them as a nuclear offensive, rather than a nuclear deterrant.
 
 
No, no one should. Least of all a country like Iran which has enough problems to be dealing with, let alone wasting billions of pounds on this crap.
 
 
People here don't seem to realise that according the Supreme Leaders (not sure whether it was the present one or the previous one) has in fact issued a fatwa against nuclear weapons... so using them on the offensive would really be off the menu.

Edit: Democracy makes a good point. I agree that they're more important, but now that other countries (including the only one to have ever used them) has nukes, it's not fair for them to use nukes as a potential bullying tool for other states.

I mean why have something spend millions on it and then not use it?

Its like having an Aston Martin in the driveway, just to show of to the neighbours.

If Israel was "allowed" to have nuclear weapons, even though none of its "enemies" have nukes, then I don't see why this game of Tic-Tac-Toe shouldn't be allowed to run its course.

As mentioned by Democracy, the extent to which I trust leaders to stick to a fatwa is negligible. Religion is subjective enough, that if someone wanted to take a certain action, which seems initally against belief, there is usually a way to find justification in the "scriptures".

But anyway, this thread isn't necessarily about religion.

Please, don't compare the average American citizen to the average Iranian  

If the US ever ends up like Iran, rest assured I will immediately say they should abandon their space program and nukes. Hell I think they should abandon their nukes right now.

But the right of nuclear energy belongs to every country.

Exactly why should we be helping the Palestinians in a way that makes us lose our own reputation and standing? JFTR the Palestinians didn't help us at all when Saddam was bombing the **** out of Iran....so why exactly do they deserve our help?

And Shervin, I really like you and all, you're a cool person but your sig really does my head in. Are you actually saying that the war Iran went through where millions died was not as bad as the Israeli situation? Are you really saying Saddam's oppression of his own people for 30 years was better than the Israeli situation? I hope not.

Urm, what were the Palestinian's supposed to do to help you guys? They're hardly in a position to help themselves. Why do you want to be helped before you help a person? Isn't that a bit selfish?

I really don't see why we should look at this from a moral viewpoint instead of a practical one (which almost everyone here seems to do). Its really very simple, look below

Iran having nuclear arms => more countries with nuclear weapons
more countries with nuclear weapons => higher probability that one country will use a nuclear weapon or loses it to the wrong people
Iran having nuclear weapon => higher probability that one country will use nuclear weapon or loses it to the wrong people

wrong people = people like Osama Bin Laden

And yes, more countries having nukes leads to higher probability of one being used, as otherwise we would support giving one to every country, which I hope nobody here thinks is a good idea.
 
 
Considering the interests of the western countries in general, no.

For a start I don't expect Yassar Arafat to give his whole hearted support to the monster that is Saddam Hussein. Arab brotherhood is all fine, but exactly what makes them more deserving than us in the 1980s?

All I'm saying is that before Iran starts giving away money which it needs for it's own country to terrorists, something that will mean that the last vestiges of its reputation are very quickly disappearing, it should assess just what the money's going to, and whether the person they're donating to is worthy of it. If Iran was donating all this money to the Red Cross to help out Palestinian civvies, I'd have no problem. However, giving away money to people who will only exacerbate the situation, in a way that harms Iran's interests and people is not something I will advocate.

  Just go away then. Your posts really irritate me. If TSR annoys you that much, log out and don't come back.
 
 
I do not mind Iran having a handful of Nukes. What concerns me is that a handful will not be enough nor will Iranian politics advance fast enough to keep the world safe. Iran needs to marginalise extremists and purge them from the organs of state power; this will not happen so I resist the idea of Iran having nuclear weapons. I have nothing against the Iranian people, they are no different to people out on the streets of London, but their leaders cannot be trusted.

Guys, you all seem to have different opinions on this issue. I'm undecided, but I’m interested to hear your opinions on why a country should have nuclear weapons, or why no country should, and also how we decide who ought not possess them.

This is why you are so annoying.

I heard somebody else saying something similar IRL - talking about young people being able to vote......

Anyone who takes anything said on here as a "decision" of any real consequence is quite dumb.
Similarly, if you believe that being a "spotty student" means you are inherently incapable of forming at least partially valid opinions on current affairs, you're dumb.
Because:
Some young folk do indeed take great interest in history, news events, current issues etc. Reading and learning about these things gives most a good-enough foundation to being able to hold up a fairly good debate (some dodgy sources aside). I am aware there are some very ill-informed posts in here, but geez, give people with credible posts some slack.
Even Avi Shraim was once a "spotty student" you know.

(Yeees, I know I haven't contributed to the issue yet, but my job for now has been to point out your annoyingness).

palestine didn't help us? they have no army  

It's the humane thing to do, you don't help someone because they helped you.

Just because Iran went through something Bad, it doesn't mean we shouldn't protest against another bad thing from happening.

And of course this oppression is worse than saddams..

Get the whole "deserve" idea out of your head. Of course they deserve our help!

And stop talking about money, Iran is a wealthy country, it's spending more than enough on it's people and needs to cut back, inflation is at 25% ffs.

Which it needs for it's own country for terrorists?  

so your anti palestinian, anti iranian, pro israel?

They sided with Saddam, that was wrong. As I said, I'm all for helping out their civvies (even though they didn't help ours). However I think giving Iranian money to a load of terrorists is wrong.

so you're anti shah, anti islamic republic, when were you happy about Iran, it seems never. You have no idea about what is good for Iran, yesterday when i asked you about what policies you'd change you said "remove the ban on alcohol" "introduce mixed schools" "remove hijab" That's never going to happen in a million years, all Iran needs is reform and not a regime change. Regime changes really don't do anything.

Do you know why unemployment and inflation is so high in Iran? Because of bad policies, our government just spalshes money about, which doesn't create jobs and just creates inflation, last time i checked we had $80 bil reserves, more than enough to help our citizens and help palestinians.

That's not all I said, don't misquote me. And those things are important too, Iran needs freedom. And reform often comes from regime change

Yes, splashing money about by donating it to terrorists in Palestine, Iraq etc, instead of investing in their own country.

stop trolling, They have enough money to invest in everything they need and have done, that's what is causing the inflation. And Hamas isn't a terrorist organisation, and they're not funding terrorism, by sending ships filled with medicine supplies and food.

Like reform came from the regime change in 1979? do you know anything about how the world works?
 

That's why I said "often". Learn to read  

 
yeah, that crossed my mind when i saw the flag, but then when you repeatdly start critisizing Iran, i got a little suspicious.
 

No...I repeatedly started criticizing Iran's government. There's a difference  

 
stop trolling, They have enough money to invest in everything they need and have done, that's what is causing the inflation. And Hamas isn't a terrorist organisation, and they're not funding terrorism, by sending ships filled with medicine supplies and food.
 

  Do you know anything about Iran? It's poor. It is not at it's pinnacle of development you know. There are regular power cuts in towns and cities cause the govt can't produce enough power due to their wasting money on ****.
 
 
  learn some economics and politics and some Iranian current affairs.

Iran is not poor, change doesn't happen over night, the quicker it happens the higher the inflation.

often? please tell me when a regime change has actually been good, and why should we have a regime change because it might bring reform, instead of bringing reform now which is happening.

Here is where i stand:
Iran should help palestine
Iran will improve through reform and not through a regime change

Here is where you stand:
~Iran shouldn't help palestine because they didn't help us (80% of them live on less than $2 a day so i don't know how they were meant to help)

Iran should have a regime change where alcohol is free (just like shah times) by the way, you said you don't like the shah, whats up with your flag?

May i remind you that we're in a better position than under the shah?

Yes Dariuysh is right in Northen Afghanistan and Tajikistan they speak Persian, and can be considered Iranian in such as they follow Iranian culture.

Central Asia - you are either Iranian, Turkic or Russian there

Iran - need to sort out their own house, the economy, greater political freedom, nuclear power, infrastructure etc....

 

I think we're on the track to sorting it out, don't you?
 
 
by the way, do you want the post or pre islamic invasion greater Iran?

That's not all I said, I thought I told you to stop misquoting me.

And that's not the Shah's flag. God, you mullah apologists are so ignorant about anything to do with Iran before 1979.

And "better"....really depends in what. In terms of personal freedom, we're not.

Well we're not worse off in terms of personal freedom, some could say we are, but i don't, the shah had a tight grip on Iran.

p.s All the shah worshipers love that flag.

by the way, i hate the mullahs as much as you do they're all corrupt, but have a regime change isn't the way forward, political reform is, and if you look at our policies over the years, we're moving forward.

His tight grip didn't extend to banning certain foods, drinks, as many newspapers, people's clothing, etc, etc, ad nauseum as the mullahs have.

Shah worshippers love a flag that has nothing to do with the shah? :wtf?: Get away with you, troll!

So let's get this straight: you hate the mullahs, but erm, you want them to stay in power. What a masochist you are  
 
 
you're such a troll, that flag isn't the Iranian flag any more, it was changed in 1979, hence why people say that represents the shah.

No, stop putting words in my mouth.

I don't like the mullahs, and i want political reform.

what is wrong with you? Do you not understand english? do you know what political reform is? The mullahs can stay if they're good economists, politicians etc. You're such a hypocrit, you critisised Iran for not letting liberal politicians run for presidency, yet you wouldn't have mullahs running for presidency.

What i want is for the best politicians in Iran getting into power regardless of their religious beliefes etc. At the moment, it's filled with hezbollahs which i'm against.

What a simple way of looking at things  

JFTR this:

 

is not the same as this:

 

The bottom one is the Shah's flag. Now stop bothering me.

What is it with you and misquoting me? A mullah has just as much right to run as anyone else....in a free and democratic election. And earlier you said you hate the mullahs. Either you want them out or you don't. If you want them out then you support regime change. If you don't want them to go, then you evidently don't hate them

you really are the most uneducated person i've seen.
What part of it do you not understand, i didn't say it was the shahs flag, i said people accociate it with the Iran under the shahs reign.

And that last paragraph is so stupid, not even going to bother.

Iran should and will have nuclear weapons, and Israel should be nuked. Turn it into a glass ashtray, they more than deserve it. That's my two cents.

Because:
Some young folk do indeed take great interest in history, news events, current issues etc. Reading and learning about these things gives most a good-enough foundation to being able to hold up a fairly good debate (some dodgy sources aside). I am aware there are some very ill-informed posts in here, but geez, give people with credible posts some slack.
Even Avi Shraim was once a "spotty student" you know.

(Yeees, I know I haven't contributed to the issue yet, but my job for now has been to point out your annoyingness).

Aww. You see, annoying people like you makes it really worthwhile.

Problem is, no one gives a crap if you think Iran should be "allowed" to have nuclear weapons or not. Isn't that tragic?

I didn't say I don't care... although there's more important things to worry about.

I pointed out that whether you "decide" one way or another, it changes nothing. Your opinion means nothing.

How's that for democracy?

I see. Maybe we should all just shut up and leave politics to the higher ups who obviously understand it better than us plebs.

Obviously I know the UN isn't going to turn around and make a decision based on what I say, however, people are still allowed to exchange ideas and their thoughts, without having to endure your grumbling.

No, you have the right to not be a troll. I suggest you use that right  
 
 
That's rich democracy, you're the biggest troll i've seen to date.
 
 
Who says that the USA is a "responsible" holder of weapons? What's the first thing they did when they got the bomb? They mass murdered civilians. Of course, nobody should have the weapons but as they're a deterrent, nobody wants to be the first to let go. If the USA can have them I think Iran should be allowed - after all, Iran is an autonomous state. Besides, I question whether Iran even plans to build a bomb, let alone use it...

Attempt? Just because it goes over your head... don't feel bad.

My opinion was (I feel a bit bad for you having to explain this) that it's pointless even bothering to discuss whether a country "deserves" to have nuclear weapons if you're not in the position to decide it.

Much like Gandalf's advice to Frodo. "Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them?"

But Meus, the purpose of nuclear weapons is not to balance out disparities. If we could get the Pakistanis and Israelis to disarm we probably would. The less nuclear weapons out there, the better. If its unlikely a state will use them, then why have them? There is no way that introducing more nuclear weapons into the middle east will improve the situation, so why do it?

As a Jew you should have rights to Israeli citizenship, which would allow you to enter Israel, although I'm not sure if you would need an Israeli passport in the circumstances. Maybe call Jewish Agency for Israel UK? Surely the embassy could have told you what to do?

By the way, you can show support for palestinians without disrespecting the 2million Iranians that died to save our country from Invasion.

 

Batejoon, someone PM'd me and asked me to put it in my sig to show support. I thought it'd be more effective if loads of people had the same sig.

You can give a numerical value of evil with 3 significant figures of accuracy but you still think Israel is a 9.2

what do you mean hate "us". If you work for the isralie government then yes i do. but if you're just an israelie then of course i don't.

My grandparents lived where israelies live now 64 years ago and they were jews.

p.s by our generocity you mean american tax payers generocity, and i think my relatives have paid enough american taxes for the both of us.

Oh come on, you still pissed about Sabra and Shatila? Goyyim kill goyyim and the Jews are blamed.

A lot of people here are suddenly "Jewish". Hrmmmm... 14 million people world wide... odds aren't high.

The muslims made people convert by building great buildings, the jews are making people convert by giving them 6 months free rent.

How could 20% of israel be atheists when you have to be jewish to become a citizen?

Because being Jewish is an ethnicity?

That means, I can convert and adhere Judaism but I will not be a descendant of Jacob. That means a Jew can be an atheist and remain a Jew (descendant of Jacob, obviously).

 

i know, but the athiests in israel aren't all jews.

Firstly you mean Arab, so I would put "dis moroccan grass" down. And you'd be wrong, the Semitic people can be sub-divided into three groups'

Hebrews
Qahtanis
Syriacs

Explicitly, the Jews are descended from the Hebrews.

Irrelevant to what I was trying to get across

What it proves is that descendants, no matter religion will be eligible for return, it doesn't matter if they're atheists.

I know, but what i'm saying is that anyone can convert to become jewish even if they aren't.

And that a lot of athiests say they're jewish for the incentives they are given,
 
 
p.s i thought you isralies were tired of new threads poping up about israel, yet you derail most of the ones that aren't about israel?

I'm not Israeli, and we reply to misconceptions.

Probably 'Common Sense', although apparently not that common! If I was an atheist and knew I'd get a lot of perks/incentives for being Jewish, then I'd most likely lie about it too.

Just out of interest, what are all the incentives you get?

You miss the point thicko. The value of opinions CLEARLY (as shown by 16 pages of discussion) doesn't affect peoples' willingness to contribute them  

I suspected that this is how you get your jollies. Must suck to be you  .

Please, stop. Stop before you besmirch the good name of anarchy any longer.

Oh, and wow, 16 pages. I once created a thread on a forum implying anyone who was American was intellectually inferior to the rest of the world. That generated 82 pages of replies. What does that tell you?
 
 
A nuclear armed Iran completely changes the balance of power in the Middle East.

The West should do everything in it's power to prevent Iran from doing so.
 
 
The West has limited power. If it wants safer, more stable troublefree future, I believe it must build ties with all parts of the world based on fairness and equality.

That has got to be a good thing.
Give nukes to all the Arab nations.
That will prevent atrocities like the Gaza massacre.
 
 
Yessssssssssssssssss
Why Not
America Can't Be Trusted
Why Shld They Havee Nuclear Weapons??
Is Israel Trusted???
No?
Why Shld They Have Nuclear Weapons??!
 
 
This reminds me of the speculation that Israel and India were planning for a joint strike on Pakistan's nuclear reactor facilities in the late 90's but the plan was aborted at the last minute. The world has something agaist Muslim states having nuclear weapons?
