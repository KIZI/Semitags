because y'all are the smartest people on thenest ;)
it's a statement from this post:
 http://community.thenest.com/cs/ks/forums/thread/62420835.aspx 
it's from pesca:
I'm no expert, but if you're $900 into the next bracket, you're only taxed additionally on that $900, not your entire income.
we were talking about this at lunch and when i mentioned this i was flat out told i was wrong. can someone point me in the direction of information?

oh, and you'll be happy to know that i was informed that because i did NOT cheat on my taxes when claiming capital gains 6 years ago i am RUINING THE COUNTRY. i asked how that worked but am still waiting for an answer.  
 
 
Irs.gov would have this too, but when I did a quick search only PDFs on that site came up. Those annoy me so here's a html link:

THIS PISSES ME OFF SO FREAKING MUCH I COULD SPIT.
i am SO FREAKING TEMPTED to email this to everyone involved in the discussion (who ALL told me i was wrong, by the way) and say EAT SH!T AZZHOLES!!!!
that would solve my job dilemna though, wouldn't it?
 
 
I think you owe it to the country to explain what every taxpayer should have already understood.
 
 
I would totally email them :D

But yep, you were completely right. But it is amazing how many people don't know that and seem to think if you make 1 dollar more, your entire income is taxed at a higher rate.

We have seen people on the MM board make references to fearing/dreading a promotion because they will get pushed into the next tax bracket. The idea that there may actually be people out there asking not to be paid more because they believe they will take home less money is saddening and astounding to me.

This is why ipads/ipods are the bet thing ever. You could have looked up irs.gov on the spot. But you can still call them up and give them some names.

I hope these people go to their bosses and ask not to get a raise. Really.

H has done this, but it was in a tax year where he began as a resident of CZ earning below the foreign earned income exclusion, so there was no witholding, then got a much better job in Switzerland putting him well above the exclusion. He then spent five months working on an assignment in Virgina. Because of the work he did in VA he was given another pay increase. Between CZ, CH, Geneva, the US, and VA his pay increase did turn into lower take home pay for him for the rest of the year because there wasn't enough time left in the year to play catch up with the withholdings. So he asked his company to hold off until the next year. Our taxes that year were a flipping nightmare.
 
 
most people aren't in your situation Publius :D
And being an expat SUCKS in terms of taxes. We are still dealing with it when we file and we left in the summer of 2009. Hopefully this is our last year.

On the flip side, H and I are happy that his first few accounts went through this month instead of last month so we can still qualify for the earned income tax credit, lol.
