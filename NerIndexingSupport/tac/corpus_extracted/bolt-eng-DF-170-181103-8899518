 Papa Obama policies and Radical Left Agenda Rejected in Wisconsin Recall 

It must be hard for Left to see all their dreams crashing before them

Madison – Republicans held onto control of the Wisconsin Senate on Tuesday, beating back four Democratic challengers in a recall election despite an intense political backlash against GOP support for Gov. Scott Walker's effort to curb public employees' union rights.

Fueled by millions of dollars from national labor groups, the attempt to remove GOP incumbents served as both a referendum on Walker's conservative revolution and could provide a new gauge of the public mood less than a year after Republicans made sweeping gains in this state and many others.
After months of agitation over the collective bargaining law,
the supreme court election, and now the recalls,

the radical Left has gained control of NOTHING!

It is a shame the Left wasted some much national money on these
local races. The way things are going that money might have been
better used on the national election
 
 
 
The Tea Party is a beautiful thing. Just watching MSNBCs Morning Joe and it was discussed for maybe 3 minutes and they switched subject.

Yes the radical Left pulled out all the big guns
and they lost big

Even their frineds in the MSM could not help them
Example:  This editorial appeared less than two hours ago on the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinels website. They held it for  the day after the election: 

how convenient
 

So it turns out that the sky isnt going to fall on all local governments in Wisconsin. The numbers now starting to come in show that Gov. Scott Walkers tools for local governments apparently will help at least some of them deal with cuts in state aid imposed by the state budget.

Thats contrary to the expectation and the rhetoric of critics in the spring, and its to Walkers credit. It bears out the governors assessment of his budget-repair bill, although we still maintain he could have reached his goals without dealing a body blow to public employee unions

But the news is good for many. The latest example is Milwaukee, where the most recent estimates show the city with a net gain of at least $11 million for its 2012 budget. That will take a slice out of the citys structural deficit, which is created by costs rising faster than revenue, and will reduce cuts that Mayor Tom Barrett and the Common Council must impose.
 
 
When you factor in that Randy Hopper was largely voted out because he dumped his wife and ran off with his secretary, the fact is, the Dems dumped tons of money into these six races and really only won one on the merit.

Next year, the anti-fraud rules will be enforced, and Wisconsin, which hasn't gone REpublican since 1984, might very well be in play next year.

with two more two elections coming up on Democrats
they victims of their own success
 

One has to wonder how the MSM will play this
Since the radical Left lost, they will not play it up

Just like the judge race was suppose to have "national implications"
was repeated all over until they found out they lost.

Then it bacame
the election did not really mean that much anyway

Truthfully, this whole process is a good example of left polices

Big talk Big Hopes
Spend lots of taxpayers money

to get no results

Sounds like almost any great social program
Welcome to Papa ObamaCare
 
 
Boo Fucking Hoo for American Marxists
 
 
The LEft is in total disarray. Their chosen leader is an empty suit. They have been rebuffed at the ballot box more times than not since '08, and their policies have been such disasters that Ray Charles could see it.
This is one more sweet victory, that doubtless will be spun by the leftys here.
 
 
I hope to be around for the beginning of fat head Ed Schultz's radio show today....He's gonna be spittin up blood....
 
 
Wasnt there a thread here recently where the liberals where chanting they had won something in Wisconsin?

Very true

with Papa Obama being the first AA+ President, it could not have helped them

Damn that S&P, racists

I fully expect the Left to become even more irrational
their behavior and actions as they fight for their last political "breath"

"Dead Policies" walking
 
 
 
I hope to be around for the beginning of fat head Ed Schultz's radio show today....He's gonna be spittin up blood....

 

Indeed

that is usually him on a normal day
 
 
 
The people have spoken

This is what Democracy feels like

6% of scientists are Republicans
 
 
 
Wasnt there a thread here recently where the liberals where chanting they had won something in Wisconsin?

 

No,

they are victims of their own success
For weeks now, they were building up
this election to drive votes and hope to use for their
political advantage

Didn't quite work out the way they thought
then again left policies never do

Good job! It help the Right reaffirm their position
 
 
wow, cons sure are gracious winners.
 
 
 
wow, cons sure are gracious winners.

 

Two words: "We won!"
 
 
 
wow, cons sure are gracious winners.

 

They lost 2 seats. This isn't much of a "win".
 
 
Really
it is happening so much
and will be in the near future with
the rejection of Papa Obama's failed policies

you think they would learn to be more humble like the left
 
 
 
 
 
wow, cons sure are gracious winners.

 

They lost 2 seats. This isn't much of a "win".

 

The kept control of the Senate
yeah it is

The Left did not get their "golden ticket"

sorry
 
 
 
 
 
 
wow, cons sure are gracious winners.

The kept control of the Senate
yeah it is

The Left did not get their "golden ticket"

sorry
 

 

six recall elections, they'd have had to win all six to get the senate. the odds were pretty long from the get-go. this isn't the mandate you think, con, but by all means, keep it up with the gloating. it's real attractive.
 
 
 
wow, cons sure are gracious winners.

 

Loosing the bastion of liberalsim should be a wake up call.

Time to run a "moderate"

have you thought of nominating Romney yet?

Y'all seem to like him so much give him a try.

Oh, btw, where can i get a Cheesehead?

I want one now

Actually they only needed three
and with the recall election of two democrats next week

the Left is a a victim of their own success
 
 
 
 
Really
it is happening so much

the rejection of Papa Obama's failed policies

you think they would learn to be more humble like the left
 

 

I think you may be right...how did the Left sound when they "won" the first seat, do you recall?

I still remember all Left and the MSM saying what a win with national implications when
they thought the judge won

After it was clear she lost., the election was not that important

Actually, they only needed to win three to gain control of the Senate. Not that they could undo anything that Walker has done so far, because Walker still controls the Assembly and the Governorship.

But what is telling is that the unions dumped MILLIONS of dollars in this election, more than has been spent in the entire 2008 or 2010 cycles in that state.

And even though one guy was pretty much a dead man walking (He left his wife for a 25 year old staffer), they only won two of the six races, and will probably lose one of the two Dems seats that are up next week.

So after weeks of telling us how these elections would be a repudiation of the TEA Party and Gov. Walker's anti-union policies, they came up way short of a win.
 
 
 
 
wow, cons sure are gracious winners.

 

They lost 2 seats. This isn't much of a "win".

 

They lost one seat. The other was pretty much a suicide.

And again, the full force of national unions pounded these guys, and guess what- four of them survived.
 
 
Let's see, 3 Republican incumbents, from Republican districts, have lost elections to Democrats. And Dems are supposed to hang their heads in shame? Instead, you righties ought to be thinking about the future. If Dems were able to unseat 3 Republicans, what else are they capable of?
 
 
Talking about last night

Republicans won 4-2

 In Spite of All That Cash, Unions Came Up Short 
For months, unions have told us that after their state-senate recall efforts in Wisconsin, lawmakers would learn not to scale back their collective-bargaining “rights.” The recalls would warn any state thinking about passing a law like Governor Walker’s to think again. Yet after Tuesday night’s recall elections, only one lesson is perfectly clear: It’s probably not a good idea to cheat on your wife.

In what might have been the most costly abstinence program in history, national unions dumped tens of millions of dollars in Wisconsin — yet their only notable accomplishment was to recall Republican state senator Randy Hopper, whose priapic misadventures sunk his campaign from the start. Polling leading up to the recall election showed voters were just fine with Hopper’s vote to scale back public-sector collective bargaining; they just weren’t so fine with his alleged affair with a then-25-year-old capitol staffer.

It wasn’t surprising that Democrats won two of the six elections. What is surprising is the way Republicans won their four. Recent polls had many of the races within the margin of error — yet in the seats they retained, Republicans won comfortably. Rob Cowles in the Green Bay area destroyed his opponent, Democrat Nancy Nusbaum, by 20 points. Republican Sheila Harsdorf, once thought to be in danger, beat a teachers’ union official by a 58–42 margin. Luther Olsen and Alberta Darling, pinpointed as possible Dem pickups, won with 52 and 54 percent of the vote. Darling did so in a district that saw the greatest number of total votes cast, at nearly 74,000.

In fact, almost 350,000 people voted in Tuesday’s recall elections — and Republicans won 53 percent of the total vote. After blowtorching the state with negative ads and benefiting from a favorable timetable, the unions could still only get 47 percent of Wisconsinites to support their effort.

This should make the unions think long and hard about whether they want to embark on a mission to recall Gov. Scott Walker next year. Doing so successfully would easily cost them five times as much as they just spent — and even with their recent deluge of cash, most of the public still didn’t support them at the polls. Additionally, the extra time will also give Walker’s reforms more time to work — and once the public sees that schools can manage their affairs effectively without being hamstrung by union regulations, organized labor’s argument gets even weake r.

It's always a pleasure to hear that the Monumental Fraud Obummer and his slimy followers are fucked.....royally !!!
 
 
Two Republicans are GONE partway through their terms and the right calls it a defeat for Democrats?

very funny.
 
 
Too bad
they kept control of the Senate

Yes the radical Left pulled out all the big guns
and they lost big

But the real good news
Walker's rational reforms are starting to pay
That is good news

According to liberals on this board this recall election was regarded as a referendum on Republicans and supposedly what was going to happen to Republicans in 2012--  

Well if liberals still consider these recall elections as a mandate--it appears that 2012 will look like another Custer's Last Stand for democrats--including Barack Obama.

wow, cons sure are gracious winners.

 

Ironic. Calling us bad winners.........when we wouldn't have "won" anything today if it had not been for the sore loser Democrats forcing a recall.

Hey, if you all force a recall, then lose, dont be pissed when we gloat  
 
 
We're going to take out all the Dems in 2012 like Baptism scene from the Godfather. They lose POTUS, probably another 75 Congress seats, half their remaining states houses too
 
 
I grew up in a union household, and I respect that in the PRIVATE sector, unions served an important purpose, to advocate for working people and to make sure that the profits of an enterprise are fairly divided between owners/investors and workers. I think the reason for their decline is that at some point, they became too insular, only really looking out for their own and not everyone.

When the workforce was more heavily unionized, everyone benefited, because even in non-union shops, employers felt a need to offer decent wages to get the best talent.

That said, unions for government workers are a horrible idea. Even FDR thought as much. There's no profit going to investors or bosses, there is just what you can get out of the taxpayer. Teacher's unions are the worst, because at some point, they became about protecting even the most worthless teachers.

You look at any meaningful education reform, whether it be teacher testing or merit pay or school choice, who is the first one to come out against it? The NEA and AFT.

This argument in Wisconsin was not about how to improve the schools, but on keeping pay and benefits for teachers.
 
 
Once WI school districts started saving money then the public sector unions were toast.

I watched MSNBC cover these elections. Jesus one would have thought it was a presidential election. I also watched whatshisname doing his best to make it sound like the Dems were gonna win big.

What a fiasco.
 
 
very true

which goes to show how much Papa Obama's radical policies with all their failings
like the bond downgrade

are being rejected by the US voter

No doubt, the Left is running scared
 
 
The leftwingtards are in a free-fall. It's gonna require a lot of Xanbars to keep them from coming completely unhinged.
 
 
It may be too late

You didn't win shit. A few Repub senators successfully defended their seats (barely holding on to them, BTW), and 3 Repub senators lost their seats to Dems. Doesn't sound like Dems lost to me. Sounds more like they won 3 seats held by Repubs. Sounds like a victory. Especially considering the fact that in the entire history of WI their have been only a few successful recalls. Dems managed to get 3 Repubs recalled in one shot. But, hey, go ahead and be delusional.

Check which stats? The races were very close. Dems one a total of 3 races, unseating 3 Repubs from Repub districts. That's pretty damn good. If you want to see foolish, look in the mirror.

Six Wisconsin senators fought Tuesday to keep their jobs in a recall election, trying to beat back Democratic challengers who stoked a political backlash against Republican Gov. Scott Walker for his efforts to strip public employees of most union rights.

Fueled by millions of dollars from national labor groups, the attempt to remove GOP incumbents did not ultimately shift control of the Wisconsin Senate to Democrats. In the match-ups that unfolded on Tuesday, the Associated Press declared four Republican state senators the winners of their respective races. Two Democratic challengers defeated sitting GOP lawmakers.
