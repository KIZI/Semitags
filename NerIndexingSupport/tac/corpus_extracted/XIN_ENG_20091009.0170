Bulgaria voiced it support on Friday to the ongoing efforts aimed at reunifying
divided Cyprus in a joint declaration signed here during Bulgarian President
Georgi Parvanov's visit.

"The Republic of Bulgaria expresses its support to the efforts to solve the
Cyprus problem on the basis of a bi-zonal, bi- communal federation with
political equality as described in the relevant UN Security Council
Resolutions," said the declaration.

Bulgaria "welcomes the Cypriot-owned ongoing negotiations under the Good Offices
Mission of the UN Secretary-General," it added.

Bulgaria expressed its hope for "an agreed, durable, just, viable and mutually
acceptable settlement" of the Cyprus problem, which it believes "will give an
impetus to the peaceful co- existence of the two communities."

Vowing to further strength their historic ties of friendship, Cyprus and
Bulgaria agreed to encourage cooperation both at a bilateral level and within
the framework of the EU, the UN and other international organizations.

During a meeting with business people from both countries, Parvanov and his
Cypriot counterpart Demetris Christofias called them to inject new vitality to
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.

The Bulgarian president is on a two-day visit to Cyprus. On Saturday, he will
meet Bulgarian nationals who live in Cyprus.

Cyprus hosts tens of thousands European workers, mainly from Poland, Romania and
Bulgaria.
