 
 
girls - hottest celebrity male
 
 
imo
brad pitt, i know hes getting on but hes talented, attractive, and kind and a real family an. swooon!
 
 
Pah, Brad Pitt's had his day. Thelma and Louise imo, was his finest moment and I doubt very much his arse looks like that now.

These days, I'm much more partial to a James McAvoy (admittedly not the best lookin fella out there, but gosh he's got 'it' whatever 'it' is!), a Jensen Ackles, a Ben Barnes, a William Moseley and a Jared Padalecki. Yum.
 
 
This guy!  

 

Jonathan Rhys Meyers
 
 
Why on earrth is this in fashion and beauty??

Anyway...  http://www.dailygalaxy.com/photos/un...even_fry_2.jpg 

 ...
Brad Pitt is a butt face.
 
 
I quite like John Mayer atm, don't think hes all that hot all the time but its his voice, its gorgeous and the lyrics he writes.
Aside from that i quite like patrick dempsey, and Jude Law and Johnny Depp.
Overall though i think David Gandy (hes a model) is perfection, but hes not really a proper celebrity. He's absoloutly the most beautiful man ever though.
 
 
The guy in Bend It Like Beckham posted above

Christian Bale!

Hugh Laurie and David Mitchell

I really don't fancy guys that are *too* pretty, or think they are. David Mitchell for the win!

Bit of eye candy can't hurt though, especially if it's Rufus Sewell:
 
 
 
Johnny Depp.

Firstly, He is NOT creepy, he is rather good looking.
And secondly, he is not a child, hes 17, and I'm not older than him.

I don't know why you care much for a thread concerning hot celebrity males, unless your gay, then I apologise.
