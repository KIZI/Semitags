Saw two excellent matches this weekend...Reading's draw at Man U and
Arsenal's come from behind last minute win at home to Bolton. The
Reading and Bolton keepers were superb (as was the Reading defense)...I
felt bad that the Bolton guy got beat late and lost.

Happy to have EPL back.  Newcastle won, which is good.  The fucking mackems
won, which sucks ass.  Our new Setanta channel which started this past
weekend is pretty good, too.  Ensures that every EPL game will be shown,
though obviously not all are live (I guess 5 of the 10 are).  Only issue is
that it's a tad pricey, but it will have the Rugby World Cup too, so it
might be worth it.

Why, are they all on cell phones not watching the game because the
only people who can afford to go are people looking to do biz and
don't give a rat's ass about the game?

They just added Setanta to my Dish Network package. I saw the terrific
match between Sunderland and Tottenham - remarkable poise by the Black
Cats' new signee Chopra. And I already had Fox Soccer, so I was all
set for the day!

Two things every football fan should experience live before they die.

Celtic supporters singing You'll Never Walk Alone (f*ck the Scouse
version, like everything else.., they nicked it)
