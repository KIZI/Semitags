Praying in the streets of Paris is against the law starting Friday, after the interior minister warned that police will use force if Muslims, and those of any other faith, disobey the new rule to keep the French capital's public spaces secular.

Claude Guéant said that ban could later be extended to the rest of France, in particular to the Mediterranean cities of Nice and Marseilles, where "the problem persists".

He promised the new legislation would be followed to the letter as it "hurts the sensitivities of many of our fellow citizens".

"My vigilance will be unflinching for the law to be applied. Praying in the street is not dignified for religious practice and violates the principles of secularism, the minister told Le Figaro newspaper.

"All Muslim leaders are in agreement," he insisted.

In December when Marine Le Pen, then leader-in-waiting of the far-Right National Front, sparked outrage by likening the practice to the Nazi occupation of Paris in the Second World War "without the tanks or soldiers". She said it was a "political act of fundamentalists".

More than half of right-wing sympathisers in France agreed with Marine Le Pen, at least one poll suggested.

Nicolas Sarkozy's party denounced the comments, but the President called for a debate on Islam and secularism and went on to say that multiculturalism had failed in France.

Following the debate, Mr Guéant promised a countrywide ban "within months", saying the "street is for driving in, not praying".

In April, a ban on wearing the full Islamic veil came into force. Holland today became the third European country to ban the burka, after Belgium, despite the fact fewer than 100 Dutch women are thought to wear the face-covering Islamic dress.

Yesterday, Mr Guéant said the prayer problem was limited to two roads in the Goutte d'Or district of Paris's eastern 19th arrondissement, where "more than a thousand" people blocked the street every Friday.

However, a stroll through several districts in Paris on a Friday suggests that Muslims spill into the streets outside many mosques.

Under an agreement signed this week, believers will be able to use the premises of a vast nearby fire station while awaiting the construction of a bigger mosque.
"We could go as far as using force if necessary (to impose the ban), but it's a scenario I don't believe will happen, as dialogue (with local religious leaders) has born fruit," he said.

Sheikh Mohamed salah Hamza, in charge of one of the Parisian mosques which regularly overflows, said he would obey the new law, but complained: "We are not cattle" and that he was "not entirely satisfied" with the new location. He said he feared many believers would continue to prefer going to the smaller mosque.

Public funding of places of religious worship is banned under a 1905 law separating church and state. Mr Guéant said that there were 2,000 mosques in France with half being built in the past ten years.

France has Europe's largest Muslim population, with an estimated five million in total.

Absolutely wrong really. This is merely being driven by a dislike of Muslims and Islam. Images of people praying being forced off the streets is going to do wonders for Frances international image as a free western democracy
 
 
liberte egalite fraternite my arse.
 
 
The French just love legislating against muslims!
 
 
Firstly, I'm an atheist.

However, this is completely wrong. Are they trying to exert authority over what people say or think? The first is against freedom of speech, the second is impossible. What if someone walks along the street muttering, can they be arrested?  

Prayer isn't intrinsically harmful, it doesn't really bother me what other people are thinking about.
 
 
Atheism is the truth down with praying and religion. I support this 100%. I just hope they knock down all the churches etc now so people move on from this religious bs.

Nah. It is aimed at this sort of behaviour (I imagine).

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1ovzCqG5Fc 

The same thing happens in Italy and Spain - with the most famous probably being a mass prayer outside Milan cathedral.

 

I believe the reasons given for this behaviour is the lack of allowances for mosque construction, personally I have no idea whether this is a valid point or not. Unlike the UK or the USA/Canada etc, quite a lot of the Euro countries are loathed to allow large mosques to be built - I'm not sure what the situation in republique francaise is.
 
 
Good. Religion should be outlawed in public places and near children. Religion harms people more than drugs. Sure, let adults do it in private, as long as they don't brainwash others.

Edit: If you're gonna neg, at least leave a reason why. But no. You people just neg because I make you mad and you can't counter my points. HAHA! Fools...

do you like exterminating them to?  
 
 
 
Thoughts?

 

Not a free country anymore.

Sure, by all means legislation against gathering in certain places without permission; but an outright ban on praying is just absurd, and is as unenforceable as it is totalitarian.

I mean, what constitutes "prayer" anyway, if I was to be sitting quietly on a bench with a Rosary, how would that cause anyone offense?
 
 
Perfectly valid in my opinion. I find praying a vulgar thing really, expecially when it requires so much obvious action as Islamic prayer. Plenty of things are banned in public, why not this? Especially when it violates the principles of a secular country? It's France and a place for the French to make as they see fit, and personally I side with them 100%. You have your places of worship, keep the worship inside of them.

It is already known that France is an extremely racist country. Arabs and blacks are treated like 2nd class citizens, never truly being accepted as "French" and often end up being forced to live in extreme poverty.

It sickens me how a so called western "liberal democracy" can pervert it's purported values in such a putrid and grotesque manner. And that Sarkozy is truly an evil cretin to boot.
 
 
 
 

 

Is it important to pray in large groups or something?

if i were theist id rather pray in my or a friend/relatives house rather than outside where its dirty/noisy etc

Hmm, I see how that could become a problem   I do believe though that there could be a way around it, like saying no physical prayer gestures on that particular street, or no more than 1 person can pray for every 5 squared metres or something like that. I fully recognise that these rules would be just as arbitrary and as hard to enforce as the rule I said was wrong, but at least it wouldn't seem quite so authoritarian.
 
 
Then build more prayer room facilities perhaps, it seems to be lacking. I imagine there are a lot of unused churches.

I'm generally against the ban of the burqa, or banning of civil sharia courts in britain, but this is one thing I can agree with (only on the grounds of prayers obstructing public footpaths etc)....

its a muslim thign to pray in congregation.

I agree with this. The current ban just makes it seem like they are against prayer just because it is prayer. At least your suggestion is more about being against prayer when it is causing obstruction to others in public.

Freedom is the ability to worship whomever you please wherever you please.

The whole point is that the government is intentionally limiting the amount of mosques which are allowed to be built (which is none at all) forcing the many muslims to pray outside in the rain.

Now they are banning them from praying in the street, effectively banning them from collective worship.

And you agree with this?  
 
 
Heh

Yes I do, I think like nudity, sex and drug use, religion should be kept behind closed doors, or at least out of the street.

Actually construction for any religious structure is hard to get in the UK, they said no to the one in East London which was to become the biggest in Europe as i recall........................................ Its probably still gonna happen regardless

Yeah, exactly. Not being a theist I don't know how this works, but I imagine that a person is sat on a bench thinking about their life or a problem, next minute they thank God, ask for help or something like that, they're suddenly praying and breaking the law. You're fully right that preventing an obstruction is fine, but trying to ban these kinds of thoughts is creating a type of thoughtcrime. It just seems too far.
 
 
In France the public display of religion is discouraged and often illegal. The problem with Islam is that it promotes this 'look at me! look at me!' attitude among its followers. They always insist on drawing attention to themselves whether it be through wearing ridiculous attention-seeking clothing or praying on the street. This clearly goes against the social norms of French society and French law. Some Muslims claim they pray on the street because there is not enough mosques, but that is false. They pray on the street even when the mosques are empty. It's just another publicity stunt from Muslims. You just need to live in any British city or area with a sizeable Muslim community and you'll know what I mean. It was only last week I saw a video on YouTube of a large group of Muslim youths praying in the Bradford city centre, right in the middle of the street.

Planning permission for any building of that scale is very difficult. The UK is not particularly difficult to get planning permission in - evidenced by the number of churches, temples, mosques, synagogues and other assorted places for the religious to go.
 
 
Let's be honest. The point of government is to keep their population safe. This is why we jail murderers, rapists, etc.

All things bad should be kept away from the general population and once sufficiently informed, they should be able to pick if they wish to harm themselves with products such as drugs and religion. Drug use shouldn't be public, nor should sexual acts and nor should religion.

I wouldn't expect to show children porn, so why would you show them prayer? There are two reasons: Education or brainwashing. The former, I have nothing against.
 
 
 
Absolutely wrong really. This is merely being driven by a dislike of Muslims and Islam. Images of people praying being forced off the streets is going to do wonders for Frances international image as a free western democracy

 

And yet it is through this - democracy - that this law is passed. Perhaps, not everyone likes Islam. And perhaps, thats not a bad thing too.

There not purpose built churches, mosques, etc they have converted the building............................ the ones that i go to are converted from ordinary homes, shops or like some weird council thing :/

Yes because none of the people who are praying will be french...
 
 
The French are marvellous.
No lily livered liberalism for them.
They maintain French culture.
As it should be.
 
 
France just has a thing against muslims really...

This picture is shocking. Why show your islam faith infront of a christian place of worship? Especially one that cannot be matched by any of their mosques?! These people deserve to be deported, as they clearly do not belong there and have no hope of integrating in the community.

This has nothing to do with liking Islam or not. Not liking Islam is one thing, thats fine I don't really like it that much. But going out of your way to discriminate against Muslims is quite another.
 
 
what a joke.
 
 
Does anybody consider my rights as an atheist?

My belief is that there is nothing to believe in. (I know this contradicts but you get the idea).

Why should I be subject to that in my everyday life?

Good for France for dumping this PC crap, they're fed up of it and rightly so.

And here we see the problems of so-called 'democracy'

A country in the West, a set of countries that are glorified for their imagined 'freedom', is using 'democracy' to counter the freedom for one to show that they have deep religious belief

I can't believe 'democracy' and 'freedom' can be used in the same sentence to describe any country as they are quite clearly able to contradict each other. In the French case this contradiction is more evident than ever before

Looks like hypocrisy reigns supreme once more

The law bans all praying in the streets, regardless of faith.

True. I have to face a barrage of religious and religious-based things (homophobia, churches, mosques, religious schools, misogyny etc.). I also find it funny how this thread seems to be centred around Muslims, and I suppose it makes sense, because I hardly ever see anyone of any other religion trying to draw this much attention to themselves. I don't see crowds of Christians all praying in the street, because it's unnecessary.

Democracy simply means the most popular opinion prevails. This makes sense - Most of france is christian, and have no obligation to tolerate public displays of islam. Therefore, they're representatives will most likely also share this opinion, and have a majority with which to pass a law which will act in the interest of the majority of the french population.

There does appear to be a great deal of confusion about democracy. It does not guarantee that the best action is always taken, nor that the right action is taken. It simply means that everyone who can vote is entitled to an opinion, which they can voice. That is the only freedom a democracy gives you.
 
 
Religion should be a private thing anyway. It has no place in the public arena.

Well it does seem a very confrontational thing to do, especially in Italy of all places!

A similar thing happened in Bologna as well. (just outside the San Petronio Basilica)

 
 
 
 
This has nothing to do with liking Islam or not. Not liking Islam is one thing, thats fine I don't really like it that much. But going out of your way to discriminate against Muslims is quite another.

 

Arguing with laws passed in a democratic state is pointless. To argue with them is to question the system itself. Laws passed, supposedly, are in the interest, or will benefit the majority of the population. The french dont want their immigrant friends to pray on their streets. End of.
 
 
Large groups praying outside are disrespectful of the other citizens. It takes space, it makes noise, etc. So no, it shouldn't happen.

However I do not agree with the way the situation is handled (used) by the government. We (I'm French) already had a law against burqa (which when we count the number of women wearing it is absolutely ridiculous), a recent public debate about national identity and many expulsions. I don't like all this hate directed to the same stigmatized population. I'm not sure I'm against the ban but I loathe all the manipulation behind it, the presidential elections are coming and, as usual, they're playing with the fear of the unknown. We shouldn't have so many debates about how muslims are dangerous while they're so many more important things going wrong in the country.
 
 
 
Yeah, exactly.

You're fully right that preventing an obstruction is fine, but trying to ban these kinds of thoughts is creating a type of thoughtcrime. It just seems too far.

 

Agreed, it's true that some places outside mosques can be dangerous or obstruct the way for others and so there's a limit to where you can pray but saying it like that adds more to the tension with muslims.

Although I wouldn't have any problem with this if they allow the construction of other mosques to compensate for this or even have enough mosques to accommodate them.
 
 
 
Yes I do, I think like nudity, sex and drug use, religion should be kept behind closed doors, or at least out of the street.

 

Why?

Now they are banning them from praying in the street, effectively banning them from collective worship.

And you agree with this?  

 

If you read the original post, a temporary alternative is being provided while they look at building a new mosque, but you must recognise that in a city with such a dense population, and such a high concentration of buildings of historical significance, one cannot simply knock down a few houses every time a religious group demands a larger space to worship. Perhaps if some muslims were to donate the land upon which their houses stand, rather than expecting land to be provided for larger mosques.

Also, the ban is specifically targeted at those blocking roads by praying, and those doing so in large groups. It is not intended to prohibit all prayer.

 http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Gout...N&hl=en&tab=wl 

If you can see a good spot for a mosque, please point it out. And don't say the park. Parks are far more important than religious buildings, quite simply because they provide a service to those of all beliefs.
 
 
 
This picture is shocking. Why show your islam faith infront of a christian place of worship? Especially one that cannot be matched by any of their mosques?! These people deserve to be deported, as they clearly do not belong there and have no hope of integrating in the community.

 

Amazing how you got all that from a picture.
 
 
My thoughts are the French (well their government at least) are not loving the Muslims at the moment, though there's not very much I can do myself I don't really support this. I fear this may cause more riots in Paris.
 
 
 
Yes because none of the people who are praying will be french...

 

Have I said they'd not be?  
 
 
 
Why?

 

I simply find it vulgar. Why is nudity vulgar? Sex, drugs or certain words are all seen as vulgar for no apparant reason other than social convention. And personally I find someone thrusting their faith down my throat, obstructing my highways and so forth to show their delusion rather vulgar. I'd not stand in the street and proclaim religion to be false whenever I feel like it. If you want to pray, do it in your home or a designated area, or keep it subtle. It's really not that difficult.

I think a country should be allowed to govern itself however it wants to. I agree with you that for us this is a strange thing for a government to do, given that we in Britain have been brought up, I presume, in a free and secular society under the guise that our freedoms are protected. France is not secular in the same way America and Britain are. I think they refer to it as Laicite. Which just happens to result in France adopting more of "Big Brother" society. The French should be allowed however, to govern themselves however they wish.
 
 
Good on the french. The people praying in large groups have their places of worship, keep the mass praying inside them. Also I do feel from some of the pictures that the mass praying is some sort of confrontational thing, it just looks like that, I could be wrong. Also it's difficult trying to get the right law, because I don't believe anyone really want to ban praying outdoors but to get rid of these large groups you have to remove all of the people who pray outside because you can't exactly say only pray in small numbers or something like that. It can't be enforced.
 
 
 
Religion should be a private thing anyway. It has no place in the public arena.

 

You should write to Points of View and tell the BBC to stop broadcasting Songs of Praise.

It's hardly "thrusting their faith down your throat", are you being physically harmed somehow?   If not it is hardly justified to warrant banning it.

I see you've got a seriously warped sense of entitlement. " my " highways   The belief that it is a delusion is your view, not theirs. Why should your view take precedence? Oh wait I forgot... that warped sense of entitlement.

It is your freedom to stand in the street and proclaim religion to be false if you want to, or are you suggesting that should be banned aswell?

Just because you dislike the idea of religion doesn't mean everyone is obligated to hide the existence of people believing it, just for your selfish warped sense of entitlement  

Also I find it puzzling that you find the human body "vulgar", is that due to some deep seated personal insecurity about yours?

Well I presume you'd be ok with people of all shapes and sizes wandering around naked then? After all, they're not physically thrusting themselves upon you right? I'm sure you'd have no problem with people shooting up on the streets? After all, no physical harm right? Well normally I;d say ours, but I'm not sure that's the case when talking to you.

I'm not asking it to be banned, but to be kept to designated areas. And I believe in a secular society we shouldn't be subjected to such silly actions.

And no my dear, I find PDA's vulgar. I do however find many human bodies vulgar, not all. But I'd rather not see 20 stone people, 80 year old people and 5 year olds all walking around naked.

Essentially, the reason that the entitlement of the people who want to use the highways trumps the entitlement of those who want to pray in the road comes down to the fact that people using the highways for their intended purpose are not preventing others from doing so, whereas those praying in the road are preventing the use of the road by other citizens, who have an equal right to use of the road.

This law does not discriminate against muslims. It bans anyone, of any faith, from praying in the road. The reason it is seen as anti-islamic is that the muslims are the only ones who are praying in the road.

It is like saying that a law banning the sacrifice of virgins is discrimination against satanists.
 
 
 
You should write to Points of View and tell the BBC to stop broadcasting Songs of Praise.

 

Indeed. I refuse to pay the license fee that it funds awful television like that.
 
 
This is magnificent! Muslims praying in the streets, for non-Muslims, is like having an EDL rally every Friday would be for Muslims.
 
 
Praying is private. People that actually have places to be don't have to listen to others talking to their imaginary friend.
Otherwise we must allow all other rituals to happen on streets.
 
 
when will the muslim threads stop? muslim this, muslim that is doing my head in! I think TSR have alot of things against muslims. Maybe muslims should start posting threads about christians

Wow.. I have got my two first neg because of what I said...honestly TSR, you need to get your head out of your arse, and start exploring the world bit more rather than posting threads to criticising muslims.
 
 
I thought worship in public areas was always illegal in France. For a long time, they've had a very strict separation of church other parts of life.
 
 
 
The French just love legislating against muslims!

 

And quite rightly so.
 
 
Really? All forms of prayer? including the little old christian lady who gives a short prayer for her family? or someone using rosaries in a cafe? Seems like its just specifically wanting to target muslims. Of course if it's obstructing the natural course of the day by occupying entire segments of streets to pray that's another matter. Should be amended to look at group prayers instead in public places. Nothing wrong with individuals giving a prayer by themselves in a non-harmful way.
 
 
 
It is already known that France is an extremely racist country. Arabs and blacks are treated like 2nd class citizens, never truly being accepted as "French" and often end up being forced to live in extreme poverty.

It sickens me how a so called western "liberal democracy" can pervert it's purported values in such a putrid and grotesque manner. And that Sarkozy is truly an evil cretin to boot.

 

You have the mind of a child. Have you never heard of a necessary evil.

Sometimes you need to commit evil acts to stop even more evil acts from bring commited.
you say the french are racist but they have a right to be. Their once beautiful country has been destroyed by immigration.in about fifty years they'll be by far a minority in their own country. They pay their taxes that then go straight to supporting immigrant cancers. That sick all the life blood from their country.

Do you know there are parts of paris once considered to be the most beautiful city in the world that are so violent they are classed as no go areas. Why is that not considered black racism against france. They now have to watch their backs and property in what was once their own areas.
 
 
 
Yes because none of the people who are praying will be french...

 

Someone give this dog a bone. Yeah that's exactly right the y won't be french.they'll be mostly immigrants,most probably illegal who were not wanted in the first place. Just like most muslims and immigrants in pretty much all european countries.
 
 
 
Democracy simply means the most popular opinion prevails. This makes sense - Most of france is christian, and have no obligation to tolerate public displays of islam. Therefore, they're representatives will most likely also share this opinion, and have a majority with which to pass a law which will act in the interest of the majority of the french population.

There does appear to be a great deal of confusion about democracy. It does not guarantee that the best action is always taken, nor that the right action is taken. It simply means that everyone who can vote is entitled to an opinion, which they can voice. That is the only freedom a democracy gives you.

 

Can I just say well done mate. One of the most mature, common sense based(or uncommon as the case may be)answers I've read on this entire site ever.

Sometimes I think it's genuinely scary how people on here can live in such a misguided child like view of how the world should be.

The funny thing is this moron believes in TOTAL freedom but fails to realise that there are many people who's freedoms negatively affect other peoples freedoms also the more freedom some people have the more they use it to inhibit and control others thereby stealing their freedom.
 
 
 
when will the muslim threads stop? muslim this, muslim that is doing my head in! I think TSR have alot of things against muslims. Maybe muslims should start posting threads about christians

 

If only they would. But thats the problem though muslims don't post threads, not really their style. They prefer to sexually groom young Christians,violently assault us and all round cause themselves to be viewed as a major pain in the arse.
 
 
Christian prayer is quiet, private and unnoticeable. Islamic prayer on the other hand is loud, noticeable and very alien in culturally Christian countries. If a Muslim wants to pray, fair enough we afford them that right. However they should respect the fact that these countries aren't Islamic and for them to pray in the street can be seen as offensive. I wouldn't go to Saudi Arabia and start singing amazing grace, first of all because I have respect for them but second because I would get deported or killed. In the west we aren't this barbaric, but again people get a similar feeling when presented with something like that so Muslims should in turn realise that such behaviour is inappropriate. Outlawing it, is a bit over the top though and I find it sad that it has had to go this far. But, another reason for this legislation as an earlier person mentioned is to counter widespread prayer demonstrations which are very anti-western in nature. This is a case for the French people to decide on, all I can do is give my two cents.

  You must be trolling surely?

Who's "they'll" are you saying other races aren't allowed to be considered "french"? What's so bad about being a minority race? If you had equality, it wouldn't matter. They made the immigrants come in to exploit their cheap labour, and now force them to live in impoverished hovels. And you are blaming them?   That is seriously twisted.

Of course they are going to riot when they are treated like 2nd class citizens, kept impoverished with no help from the government and perpetual police brutality, oppression, racism and harassment.

Blame the government for creating the situation and not helping it, not the people who have to live with it.
 
 
 
My thoughts are the French (well their government at least) are not loving the Muslims at the moment, though there's not very much I can do myself I don't really support this. I fear this may cause more riots in Paris.

 

Yes. Because naturally, riots are the answer to everything.  
 
 
 
If only they would. But thats the problem though muslims don't post threads, not really their style. They prefer to sexually groom young Christians,violently assault us and all round cause themselves to be viewed as a major pain in the arse.

 

Most Muslims have better things to do rather than dedicating a whole thread to listing complaints about other religions.

I agree with Stefan.
 
 
 
You wouldn't be deported or killed for singing Amazing Grace. I'm not sure what country that happens in but it's not Saudi Arabia.

 

Killed was an overstatement, unless you are a Saudi Arabian convert. But things such as openly displaying a crucifix or public gatherings of faith are prohibited. The country isn't well known for it's freedom of religion.
 
 
First the burka's, now praying - I wonder what will be criminalised next?
 
 
i AGREE WITH THIS.. muslims dont like it? there problem..
 
 
 
Perfectly valid in my opinion. I find praying a vulgar thing really, expecially when it requires so much obvious action as Islamic prayer. Plenty of things are banned in public, why not this? Especially when it violates the principles of a secular country? It's France and a place for the French to make as they see fit, and personally I side with them 100%. You have your places of worship, keep the worship inside of them.

 

You'd love how things are done in Iran and North Korea. Right up your alley.

PS. The principal of secularism is to ALLOW religious freedom of expression by not designating state religions and dictating what people can and can not believe. Not your twisted notion of 'secularism through enforced repression'
 
 
I think the ban applied to worshipping in Public
So its ok for people to dance in public and listen to loud music

but if you go the park for a day out decide for 5min to a quick stand up,bow,sit on your knees and stand up again you will be arrested hmmmm

or before an exam you make a small prayer with your hands together you will be arrested
 
 
praying in public places? so does that mean christians and jews cant clasp their hands and pray on the streets even if its small.

damn the french!
 
 
lolo

No one forced them to go to France, and the French do not want them there. They can simply move back to their homeland, and no I do not care if they were born there or not.
 
 
Good; anyone who disagrees misunderstands the context created by the French Revolution (Laïcité), whereby extreme secularism was put in place to protect the people from the influence of the Catholic Church. If people don't like this level of muscular secularism, then they **** off back to Algeria/Vatican City/Tibet.
 
 
I saw a YouTube video, it was an interview with a group of Muslims after friday prayers, they said they would prefer praying inside a mosque, but they were being denied the opportunities so were forced to pray outside.

Also, when a government starts banning this sort of thing, what next? A ban on a ''religious protest'', then a normal protest? Its a dangerous route they are leading down

French secularism discourages public displays of worship, and this applies to everyone and all religions. They go to France they can live by French rules and laws. This is France one of the most beautiful European countries, not some middle eastern bazaar

Please just shut up about colonialism. France contributed greatly to those countries, and the French people who were not even born at the time of colonialism have no obligaiton to accept them into their society.

The colonialist argument is really, really running thin. You also forget to mention that southern European countries were colonised by north African moors. You forgot to add that though did'nt you. By your logic, countries like France spain and Itlay have a right to colonise north Africans countries because they themselves were colonise by the moors, so ineffect it was actually France paying back them.

You are reading the law in a far too English way. If this was an English law, it would be interpreted to the letter, and anyone praying in public could be arrested, however French law works more to the spirit of the law, and this is intended to stop disruptive large scale actions like those Muslims who were blocking traffic by praying in the road.

Where does religion end and mental illness begin? If a guy hears voices and acts on them in the 10th century this is divine, in the 21st century this is insanity. Why should a rational modern country like France go out of their way to accomodate people who believe that what someone experienced over a thousand years ago, which could easily be explained as psychological phenomina is the word of God?
 
 
So technically you are banned from doing exercise on the streets. Which is stupid.

Prayer is the equivalent of moving your body, it is just the fact that the purpose is prayer so they want to ban it. This screams racism.

What if someone invented their own form of prayer and it involved jogging on the spot?
 
 
As an athiest I think religion should be done in private (that includes churches, mosques). However, they were only praying on the streets because of a shortage of mosques which isn't their fault. I think they should be able to pray on the streets while there's no other space available if it's not a busy road.

How is it not their fault? If they want more Mosques then they should either build them or have less children.

Except it is, it's a form of supression - and as a social libertarian, I believe people have the right to do whatever they like as long as it doesn't infringe on other peoples' rights/hurt people. An atheist has a right to wear a 'I <3 Evolution' T-shirt and likewise, a Christian/Muslim/Bhuddist has the right to praise their respective Gods.

I disagree, There is a difference between social expression and scenes like this -

 

Scenes like this are common in Paris, and it is obscene. The French have had to make laws banning praying on the street because of scenes like this, they have a righ to protect their culture and society from this unwanted alien influence. These people are free to worship their god, they are not free to turn Paris streets into downtown mecca.

Don't like it they can leave no one in France wants them there.
 
 
What are those green cubicles on the sides for?
 
 
 
Absolutely wrong really. This is merely being driven by a dislike of Muslims and Islam. Images of people praying being forced off the streets is going to do wonders for Frances international image as a free western democracy

 

Agreed. Not to mention most of the countries France is liberating are muslim majority.
 
 
 
Someone give this dog a bone. Yeah that's exactly right the y won't be french.they'll be mostly immigrants,most probably illegal who were not wanted in the first place. Just like most muslims and immigrants in pretty much all european countries.

Fair enough, but the point stands. People have the freedom to 'idolise' as much as they wish.

Nope, not really. People have the freedom to pray quietly and people have the right to form mass demonstrations - and everything in between so long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others.

 
Scenes like this are common in Paris, and it is obscene.
 

Regardless of the fact that you are so invested in Islam to have such strong emotions toward it, that's the point about freedom; you don't get the choice to dictate what others can/can not do, regardless of whether you find it 'obscene' or not.

 
The French have had to make laws banning praying on the street because of scenes like this, they have a righ to protect their culture and society from this unwanted alien influence.
 

It's not alien unless they aren't French citizens, and somehow I don't think France's 10% Muslim Minority are completely analogous to 'illegal immigrants'

 
These people are free to worship their god, they are not free to turn Paris streets into downtown mecca.
 

Actually, they are. That's why we live in Europe, and not North Korea.

 
Don't like it they can leave no one in France wants them there.
 

Or, if you don't like it, you're free to leave. Freedom trumps authoritarianism  
 
 
I don't see why they didn't simply ban the blocking traffic? No need to make it about religion, and you'd address a lot of other potential delays too. So now, praying's banned, but standing in the road chatting is fine yet causes the same blockage?

As far as I understand it this law only states that you cannot pray in a street, the motorized right of way, not "the streets" as in, "there was panic in the streets of Paris". It seems they want to prevent vehicle/pedestrian crashes and blocking of traffic. Sounds completely reasonable.

Yes they do; have you ever set foot in a Catholic Church do you know how important recieving the Eucharist is to a Catholic, yet these people maintain calm and dignity. As for Pastafarians here is a copypasta of one of their prayers:

Our Pasta

Our Pasta, who “Arghh” in heaven, Swallowed be thy shame. Thy Midgit come. Thy Sauce be yum, On top some grated Parmesan. Give us this day our garlic bread. And give us our cutlasses, As we swashbuckle, splice the main-brace and cuss. And lead us into temptation, But deliver us some Pizza. For thine are Meatballs, and the beer, and the strippers, for ever and ever. RAmen.

I can understand the point about obstruction of the road causing traffic and increased risk what with having to divert vehicles and such, but a law to ban praying in the streets of France is just, pathetic. I'm sorry, but I don't see the harm one person sitting down on a bench with rosary beads, or one Muslim (who's not near a mosque) whom decides to pray in a park, or even a side street, on the pavement, would cause. It's their freedom of expression to do so.

The law itself just seems like a target to further show France's dislike of Muslims. As one poster said if they'd decided to combat the obstruction caused by some form of law i.e no blocking road, no more then four people praying within a metre of each other, you know, an attempt to solve the actual problem ( obstruction) rather then a law against 'praying', it'd be more understandable and an actually pretty reasonable attempt to make a valid point without trying to fuel tensions.
 
 
 
You obviously have not seen the pictures of Muslims praying on the street, are you thick or something ?

 

The reason they've banned praying in the streets (or the reason they've given, anyway) is that it blocks traffic. Just ban blocking traffic and you solve more problems without making a religious issue out of it. Then again, I suppose their government wants to make a religious issue out of it with plausible deniability.
 
 
 
Freedom is the ability to worship whomever you please wherever you please.

The whole point is that the government is intentionally limiting the amount of mosques which are allowed to be built (which is none at all) forcing the many muslims to pray outside in the rain.

Now they are banning them from praying in the street, effectively banning them from collective worship.

And you agree with this?  

 

So if me and 40 mates jump out of the car on the M25 during rush hour and start praying, that is perfectly acceptable? And it would be against my human rights if the police removed me us from all the lanes?

They have a right to pray and practice their religion, but if it obstructs others then they should not be allowed to do it. There are a whole bunch of things we are not allowed to do, but suddenly if you wrap lots of them together in a parcel and call them 'religion', you cannot legislate against them?
If there were thousands of Christians or Jews crowding the streets every Friday, I would feel no different. The occasional festival is fine, as an Atheist even I enjoy going to them sometimes, but every single week?

The law itself is designed to try and get the right wing vote because elections are coming up. The Front National in France is the most popular political party atm and they're very opposed to Muslims/Arabs in France so Sarkozy will need their vote. The Muslims don't seem to mind on the whole, the only reason they did it was because there were no buildings available but they've been allowed to use a disused fire station instead so it's a win-win.
 
 
My God white people have a shockingly bad world knowledge. Fact: India has not been in a constant state of timelessness since 1947. Believe it or not, it has progressed and despite random and sporadic incidence of unrest - is still a more secular nation than France

Our Pasta, who “Arghh” in heaven, Swallowed be thy shame. Thy Midgit come. Thy Sauce be yum, On top some grated Parmesan. Give us this day our garlic bread. And give us our cutlasses, As we swashbuckle, splice the main-brace and cuss. And lead us into temptation, But deliver us some Pizza. For thine are Meatballs, and the beer, and the strippers, for ever and ever. RAmen.

I don't think there is anything particularly wrong with this, as long as it is applied equally amongst all religions. I am not anti any religion but i don't find it particularly fair that this law causes such a hue & cry, yet in some Islamic countries, you can't even erect buildings of other faiths. People are free to manifest their religion, but I think public spaces should remain neutral. I dont think anyone can truly take offense to that.

If people feel so strongly about this, perhaps they should remain in a country where they are allowed to freely practise their religion where they want. I don't think you can come to another country, which has its own values and then expect it to adapt to what suits one religion/culture etc.
 
 
 
My God white people have a shockingly bad world knowledge. Fact: India has not been in a constant state of timelessness since 1947. Believe it or not, it has progressed and despite random and sporadic incidence of unrest - is still a more secular nation than France

 

What is world knowledge

Right, this is all something which can only take place in an indoor/established church - and as such, the law would not affect such people.

It's a parody religion, and thus has no real observance. /mute point.

Thanks for your generalisation. You'll be disappointed to know that I was born here and my parents are from Gujurat - the violence occured a year after I visited.

The death toll was around 1,000 and 70,000 people fled their homes. It was pretty bad.

There's also been some clashes in a neighbouring state (can't remember the name) in the past couple of days. Religious violence/discrimination is still common in India.
 
 
 
The law itself is designed to try and get the right wing vote because elections are coming up. The Front National in France is the most popular political party atm and they're very opposed to Muslims/Arabs in France so Sarkozy will need their vote. The Muslims don't seem to mind on the whole, the only reason they did it was because there were no buildings available but they've been allowed to use a disused fire station instead so it's a win-win.

 

I agree with it being a win-win situation, but it does make me uncomfortable the way they've decided to approach this, when they easily could have found hundreds of alternative and sensible ways to stop the obstruction of the roads ( in regards to how the law would be portrayed)

The fact that it seems 'praying in the streets' of France is banned, means it's slightly laughable if putting your hands together is against the law.

If they'd just attempted to pass a law which outlawed obstruction/disruption of a street then they'd be covering a whole range of situations, rather than, the current one which is 'prayer'
 
 
Religion should be personal and private, thus I agree with this law. If you want to pray, do it in a religious building, such as a mosque or church, or in your home. It does not need to be done in public, especially if it'll disrupt the daily lives of others.

Yes but it needs to appear to be targeted at Muslims to attract the right wing vote. I bet it won't even be enforced. If it was a generic, health and safety type law then it wouldn't attract the right wing vote.

Yeah, it's obvious that's why it's been so specific to praying, it's just I suppose I'm thinking with a 'British point of view' where the idea of having to pander to far right groups and being reliant on their support in order to remain in government is not really an issue.
 
 
 
Explain exactly how India is more secular than France.

 

Because India's government doesn't try to marginalise 10% of its population.
 
 
Good. I don't want to see psychopaths talking to the voices in their heads when I go out.
 
 
I don't think that when people pray they do so through a hive consciousness that obliterates individual thought, subsuming it to the group effort.
Physical proximity to others is not necessary for prayer as it's not a group effort: each person's prayer is different.
If someone chooses to pray while walking down the street and does so without anyone else knowing about it there is no problem. Traffic is not disrupted and people can walk unhindered along the pavement.
Why do some groups choose to make a public display of their prayer?
Isn't it just a form of showing off?
 
 
Well done the French.
 
 
This is just needlessly authoritarian. As a firm atheist I object to it.

It is only pandering through the media, As far as I understand it this law only states that you cannot pray in a street, the motorized right of way, where as many people have taken it to mean something similar to the Nudist laws which are enforced in every public space

Really it just means that people cant pray on busy streets and roads, probably why a lot of Muslim leaders support it, cant be very safe for either cars or the people praying.
 
 
 
You mean filthy socialist liberal

 

I'm not even a socialist, you cretin, I'm a classical liberal.

Secularism is the separation of Church and state, roads are property of the state (the people) and thus should not be used to pray on in a secular nation.

again please dont listen to the general rubbish about this.

They have not banned praying in all public spaces, all they have done is ban people from praying on active roads/streets which is perfectly sensible and was done for the safety of the people who are praying and the drivers/pedestrians

It has the support of most Muslim leaders in France because it will help to reduce tensions and also keep people from getting hurt. if someone wants to go and pray in a park for example, they are more than free to do so.

I'm not a member of the UAF nor do I endorse them, so I don't see why that matters. That said, I find it hilarious that that's the best you can muster is a scrap of nonsense about how butthurt you are over the existence of the UAF.

I dread what kind of awful things worse than this will happen in the future.

most of the stuff in the media at the moment is rubbish, please don't pay attention to it.

The law does not stop people praying in all public spaces, it only stops them from praying on active roads/streets. This is to do with health and safety as well as stopping some roads from being blocked. If people want to pray in a park or even car park they are more than free to do so

The law applies to all religious people not just Muslims.

Nobody is saying that Muslims are not allowed to pray; but praying on roads when motorists need to use them is unacceptable. If I want to dress up as a voodoo witch-doctor and dance around on zebra-crossing this will cause mayhem for those trying to get to work. No religious person has the right to pray on public property (i.e. roads) if this will be detrimental to the rest of society. You cannot compare France to North Korea in any way, such a suggestion is ludicrous, and the analogy is akin to using Hitler to argue for a ban on moustaches. So please, until God can be proven, society must not pander to the whims of people and what they believe a divine being wants of them; this is not to say that their beliefs should be outlawed, but this is to say that as soon as their beliefs harm society in any way however small, the law must step in.

Complete religious supression is not the same as legislating against praying on the roads, paid for by motorists (before you say that Muslims are motorists) for the right to use them for their original purposes.

But it does violate secular principles, as I have already explained. Furthermore he did not state that this is not for safety reasons.

Who's minster Le Figaro?   It's a newspaper. I apologise if I've missed something here. If this was a drive to attack Muslims as opposed to promote safety, how come the French government have been making alternative places to pray available for Muslims?
 
 
Good, it may not seem like the right decision at the moment but in the long run it definitely is. I can't wait for the day where being religious is extremely frowned upon, and it will come when people come to their senses.

Freedom of religious expression on roads? There is a time and a place for these things, public roads are not the correct places for religious expression, it's unsafe, contrary to seclular principles and very silly indeed.
 
 
 
Yes. Because naturally, riots are the answer to everything.  

 

Your sarcasm is not appreciated, I never said it was the answer doesn't mean it would stop people doing it. Paris has already had riots due to tensions between ethnic minorities and the way the government has treated them. Clearly this will cause tension between the government and the Muslims which can cause problems for the country.

No one forced them to go to France, and the French do not want them there. They can simply move back to their homeland, and no I do not care if they were born there or not.

 

 

They were expressly encouraged by the french government to come to France because of the labour shortage after WWII. Many thousands had come to France after fighting in the war on the French side.

Then when they had finished exploiting their cheap labour and they were of no further use as expendable objects, they were left to rot in dilapidating housing tenements and the problem was brushed under the carpet to the suburbs, in what some people describe as 'inhumane areas', with little in the way of public services. A government sponsored ghettoization of minorities and system of urban apartheid.

Out of the sight, out of mind, where the tourists couldn't see them and so they can still pretend to be such a sophisticated, liberal, egalitarian society   and yet treat humans as animals because of their race.

Treated like 2nd class citizens, unable to get jobs or housing because of discrimination or even recognition in a apartheid culture.

Then they bring in the police to massacre innocent protesters.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_m...of_1961#Events 

You make it sound so easy, I can't believe anyone can be so naive. Just "move back to their homeland"  

Where would that be? They are native French, have been born there and lived there all their life, they have no connection, attachment or relation to the countries their ancestors generations ago came from. They are not truly from those countries, and they will never be allowed to be truly French. But they are just as French as the French. So they have forced to become a third nationality which will never be acknowledged or accepted. People like you make me sick.
 
 
 
Good; anyone who disagrees misunderstands the context created by the French Revolution (Laïcité), whereby extreme secularism was put in place to protect the people from the influence of the Catholic Church. If people don't like this level of muscular secularism, then they **** off back to Algeria/Vatican City/Tibet.

 

Yes, extreme secularism used to mask extreme racism.   How can it be a secular society when you have the state legislating on all things religious? Massive contradiction there. But yet, only "foreign" religions seem to be affected. Strange that isn't it?

And no they are not native french, native french are the native ethnic groups native to France. Why are you people so desperate to be native Europeans ?
 
 
 
They can pray in their homes, it is not up to the French to build mosques for these people.

 

Yes of course, ethnic French should not get the same rights as white French, yes.  
They are French aswell.

Truly disgusting.
 
 
 
Please just shut up about colonialism. France contributed greatly to those countries, and the French people who were not even born at the time of colonialism have no obligaiton to accept them into their society.

 

 

If you actually thing colonialism was a good thing, I seriously urge that you consult a history book.

But if you're in France don't bother, history has magically been altered in most of the textbooks there!

Yes, extreme secularism used to mask extreme racism.   How can it be a secular society when you have the state legislating on all things religious? Massive contradiction there. But yet, only "foreign" religions seem to be affected. Strange that isn't it?

 

No, all religions are subject to this law not just Islam.

Like I've already said this extreme secularism stems from the times of Revolutionary France (protection against the tyranny of the Catholic Church etc); you could say that it is part of the French way of life, and if the Algerians or whoever, don't like the French way of life they, can leave. Furthermore, praying on roads is dangerous and disruptive to motorists so should be banned on those grounds anyway.

"Ideas are far more powerful than guns. We don't let our people have guns. Why should we let them have ideas?" -Intolerant of the ideas of others

I'm pretty sure power was decentralised in the form of Soviets in the USSR. Stalin himself I'd consider him to be a fascist though, yeah.
 
 
I dont think thats good.Is not like every tom,dick and harry can pray on the streets. people who manage the mosque will talk with the local authority such as the police and will organise a way for them to pray on the streets. Like on Eid there are police outside mosques who work with the mosque so they can mainly manage the people and make the neighbouring roads safe so large events such as eid,ramadan etc can happen.

In this country(UK) mosques Cooperate with the police and their local councils which make large praying events happen So I think its a shame France cant follow this approach.

I dislike the guy, but I'm afraid I must disagree (as I disagree with your definition).

Interestingly many Muslims in the middle east would be considered fascists based on this definition. Afterall Islam means submission (to God) and as God cannot/does not speak for himself the people must submit to the next best thing, whoever apparently speaks for God (The Grand Ayatollah or the Grand Mufti), so here's your totalitarianism. As for the treatment of, "infidels" in the middle east, here's your intolerance.
 
 
 
Nope, not really. People have the freedom to pray quietly and people have the right to form mass demonstrations - and everything in between so long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others.

 

The crucial point is that by blocking roads and making a nuisance of themselves, they are infringing the rights of others. If you lived in paris, and you couldn't get into your house because the road was filled with people praying, are your rights not being infringed?

Yes, because on a daily basis, Muslims flock to Paris specifically to interfere with peoples' ability to get in and out of doorways  

No, in reality - safety and road concerns were not cited by the French minister. He decided it was against 'Secular values' and decided to marginalise a significant minority to further his own Islamophobic agenda.

Because I don't want preaching done in public.

I don't think most religious people want to hear me go on about athiesm, nor do I want to hear about their religion really. It's a private matter what one chooses to believe.

Do you even know what secularism means? I don't think so.

"Secularism is the separation of a government, organization or institution from religion and/or religious beliefs. "

In other words, the total separation, intervention or involvement of the state in religious affairs. And vice versa.

Hence why the state passing legislation banning people from wearing religious garments, displaying religious symbols and praying in the name of "secularism" is a total contradiction.  

France has a lot of churches, cathedrals and places for Christians to worship. Yet the fact there is a huge population of adherents to other religions is ignored.
Hence why their claim to be an "egalitarian society" is just a huge joke, which intelligent people laugh at.

You might say "why don't they go build some mosques?" Who do you think exactly is denying the planning permission?

People should be able to say what they like in public if it's not harming anyone, it's called "freedom of speech". A human right every individual should be able to enjoy.

Just because you don't happen to like it doesn't give anyone justification to ban it. Why should what you want take precedence over everyone else?

How are Muslims minding their own business praying to their God on a Friday morning trying to convert you? You have completely changed the subject and are now talking about something else...

Are you physically unable to or too socially inept to say "sorry I'm not interested" and walk away? Instead of just doing that you think their right of free speech should be banned? You are an idiot! :Facepalm:

It's up to the individual to decide whether they want their religion to be a public or a private matter, not you. Now go work on that bloated sense of entitlement.

And no they are not native french, native french are the native ethnic groups native to France. Why are you people so desperate to be native Europeans ?

 

 

Sorry? What are the "native ethnic groups" "native" to France?  

No ethnic groups are native to France, we all came from Africa. Are you talking about the Gauls? The Franks? The Goths? The Visigoths? The Vandals? The Celts? The Romans? The Bretons? Normans? Sallii? None of these ethnic groups are native to France, they all came from somewhere else at one point.

Arabs are Aryans and Indo-Europeans. They are native to France just as much as the other ethnic groups because they have emigrated there and been there for a while. There is no such thing as a "native" ethnic group, because they all migrated from somewhere else previously. And even if there was, they shouldn't have more rights than other ethnic groups.

Roads are state property and so should not be used for prayer in a secular society.
 
 
Great news. A victory for French culture. Now, why can't the UK take similar steps?
 
 
Solution : Deport them. Most of these people are unemployed, if these dirty cretins wish to pray so much, they shouldn't have crossed the border and should be back in their own countries.

PS. The principal of secularism is to ALLOW religious freedom of expression by not designating state religions and dictating what people can and can not believe. Not your twisted notion of 'secularism through enforced repression'

 

 

I find praying as vulgar as a lot of so called 'hate speech' which is banned. Just because you find it agreeable doesn;t mean we all do, and seeing as censorship is already woven into our society I'd like it to work in my favour for once, rather than minorities all of the time.

Sigh. Not anti-Islamic.

Anti-religion. And not even anti-religion. There are laws about public nusiance, causing a hazard, disruption of the peace etc. Just ensuring the mandate is met with no exception for imaginary friends.
 
 
Firstly, a street is not a social commune. It is a way for cars to get from one place to another. It should not be annexed to any religious bigots with a superiority complex. So I would support any ban to stop this nonsense happening in a street.
 
 
That seems so wrong. Surely this goes against freedom of religion?!

France are going to far now, they don't have the right to do this, well they do because they have done, but this is really unethical. Ok the burkha ban is valid in my opinion but it seems as they want to totally want to demonize Islam and banish it. So if they don't ban people wearing crosses why should they ban people from praying? Islamophobia is becoming common throughout Europe and it's really sad to see a religion being brandished a terror religion, France is becoming like Nazi Germany, soon they will not allow Muslims to live normal lives.
 
 
I wouldn't be surprised if France banned muslims livin there at this rate.
 
 
France bans sexual acts in public. France bans public praying in streets used for cars and pedestrians.

Actually this will affect Christians, Jews, and all other religious believers just as much as Muslims. I disagree with the law, but you have to recognise that its purpose is to defend public secularism (which is enshrined in the French constitution) rather than specifically to attack Muslims and Islam. And it doesn't in anyway affect the functionality of French democracy - every French person, regardless of their beliefs, will retain their vote.

Re-read your post, good old Godwin was peaking in. And clearly you need to look up a definition of Facism by the way.

The problem is all these laws regarding 'inciting hatred' and so forth are geared toward preventing the majority expressing themselves as they want to whilst the minorities are almost never subject to them. For instance with Poppy burning, or flag burning there were no convictions of inciting hatred. However when Quran's are burnt there are. Quite the double standard in my opinion.

And pray tell then. Why is masturbation more offensive than prayer? You see, you see masturbation as offensive because it is sexual, you sexuality as something to be kept hidden because of socieities' view, and socities' view comes from centuries of backward religious BS. So if you can logically demonstrate to me why masturbation is more offensive than prayer do so, but bear in mind it has to be logical, and not some vauge feeling of discomfort.

 
Not really, it's the same at the mosque I go to, people put the prayer mats on the pavement if there isn't enough space in the mosque, the pedestrians walk around and in 20 mins it's all over.

 

And that should not be allowed. The pavement is a public highway and should not be obstructed in such a way. You should stay inside the Mosque or at the very least, on Mosque grounds. If there is not enough room then some people have to stay home, or have a rolling worship or something like that. It is your issue to sort, not everyone elses, and you shouldn't be out on the streets doing it.

 
Please give an example of laws which discriminate against you and are suited to minorities.

 

Every 'hate' law I can think of. Minorities are virtually never convicted whereas the majority is the only one really affected by these laws. Such as instances of Poppy burning and Flag burning which apparantly in no way incite hatred. Calling soldiers on the streets during a parade murderers is apparantly not inciting hatred. Mitigating terrorists and proclaiming your admiration for them is apparantly not offensive or incicting hatred. But burning a book is. It's a double standard whereby only minority groups ever have the right to be offended and do something about it.

Blimey, laïcité to the extreme!
But to be fair, although most of the article concentrates on Islam, it does say that other faiths are prohibited too. And I really cannot see why you would want to pray in the street anyway. And it's in response to the fact that they block the streets so people can't get past, which is not only a public nuisance but also a health & safety risk when you think about how the French drive  
 
 
This is about keeping the streets clear, right? Well, I think we should ban people from walking around. That will clear the noise and disruption that they cause.

Or perhaps we only need to make it a half-measure: ban brown people from walking around, so there's more space for everyone else.

People need to stop making out that this is an Islamophobic or racist law. It will affect all religions and ethnicities. Many churches which carry out healing ministries in the streets and the like will also be banned from doing so in France.

This is a pro-secularism law, not an anti-Islam law.

That's not an issue, if some Muslims want to turn up and do the same fine, if the UAF do or anyone else, that's fine. What I'm asking is for there to be no double standard. Burning Poppies or Flags is just as offensive as burning a Quran, far more so to me. Obstructing a public highway is a crime, and so should it be regardless of whether you are worshipping some imaginary diety.

Could you please give some examples of the hadiths and quran he 'preaches'

when will the muslim threads stop? muslim this, muslim that is doing my head in! I think TSR have alot of things against muslims. Maybe muslims should start posting threads about christians

 

In what way do you think encouraging 'Christianity related posts by Muslims' to even things out would improve things and solve the problem you think exists?

Having said that though, I actually agree that many (ie most) of the Muslim/Islam related threads are started to criticise. Very few, if any, ever develop with serious and sensible debate as most posts are made by members with polarised opinions and very entrenched views. Hardly a recipe for a positive thread. So in that respect I have to admit uttering the odd "oh ffs, not another one"   when I see the list of threads. FWIW, my own views on the bigger them/us issue are set out here

do you like exterminating them to?  

 

Thats an ironic comment being made. Go read your Bible or Koran or just look at some history books, then turn the   back at yourself
 
 
I don't think some of you understand. Congrational prayer in Islam on a Friday is a must- which is why you see many men on the streets praying there. Do you think they enjoy sitting outside in the cold? The mosques are too small, there are very few of them and the only other choice is to pray outside. Stop with the hate people, its clear France has a problem with muslims..first hijabs, then burka, then praying outside? What next? If theres a crazy loud protest outside that is not illegal, but a group of men quietly praying outside on a friday for 10 minutes is? Ridiculous..and they call themselves a democracy?
 
 
 
I don't think there is anything particularly wrong with this, as long as it is applied equally amongst all religions. I am not anti any religion but i don't find it particularly fair that this law causes such a hue & cry, yet in some Islamic countries, you can't even erect buildings of other faiths. People are free to manifest their religion, but I think public spaces should remain neutral. I dont think anyone can truly take offense to that.

If people feel so strongly about this, perhaps they should remain in a country where they are allowed to freely practise their religion where they want. I don't think you can come to another country, which has its own values and then expect it to adapt to what suits one religion/culture etc.

 

You're an idiot. Ever considered the fact that these are French citizens and the fact that it IS their own country. What ignorance...
And applied equally amongst all religions? Have a laugh...we all know that this law was made especially for Muslims. This is something focusing on Islam and if you can't see that then you are blind.

Yeah reading parts of the Quran on religionofpeace.com and listening to a person who only focuses on the negatives of Islam has clearly allowed you get a nice and well rounded picture of the religion.

Fundamentalist Christians and Muslims are actively exclusivist in their mentality, defending old testament genocide and that sort of thing.
 
 
 
Absolutely wrong really. This is merely being driven by a dislike of Muslims and Islam. Images of people praying being forced off the streets is going to do wonders for Frances international image as a free western democracy

 

Exactly, and this is clearly targeted at Muslims, given that no other major religion requires prayer at specific times, and in many faiths prayer cannot be performed just anywhere anyway. So this is only going to be an issue for Muslims.

France disgusts me sometimes.

To be fair, you can have genocidal thoughts without being theist...you just need a warped/twisted mind
And it's not like religious texts state stuff like "kill everyone who disagrees" (if you can find it, please tell me where, would be quite interesting to see that), it's how they interpret it...

Why would you want to restrict peoples freedom so much outdoors? I can understand turning pavements into roads for people, but you are talking about stopping people doing things like praying on all public land? I suppose reading is best done at home, but people like to do it outdoors too.
 
 
Look, the point is they're blocking the streets, which are meant for everyone to walk on. They just happen to also be Muslim - if they were feminist or environmentalist or what have you, it'd be the same exact issue. You can't just block up the whole darn highway and expect people to make exceptions for you.
 
 
I don't understand people who believe this is targeted at Muslims. France is an inherently secular nation, and so should be able to impose secular-based laws in its country.
 
 
Uh, no. Unless you're getting in everybody's way by doing so, do what you please.

Of course you can be twisted regardless of your religious views but when a group in its fundamental concept defends genocide if their god ordered it, that's beyond a twisted mind.
There is in recorded history glorification of violence, genocide, xenophobia, and homophobia encouraged and believed to be mandated by God. For example, the time when the Christian-Judeo god told Saul to kill all the Amalekites,
 
Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass
 

(1 Sam.15.3)

And just to rub it in, the fundamentalists who believe and defend everything in the bible say something like this:

 
It's worth noting that being killed with a sword (perhaps beheaded) was at the time one of the quickest ways for the children to die

Do we share our private family relationship in Public? Our relationship with god is more precious than that... and I rather keep it private.

Private family relationships are made quite obvious in public, people don't hide their girlfriends, parents or whatever. Unless you mean "private" as in sexual, in which case that's not hidden because it's "precious" and... do you get sexual with God?

Actually it will affect Christians too. For example, during a stay in Paris I briefly attended an église évangélique in Créteil which has a 'healing on the streets' ministry in which church members pray for sick people they meet in public locations. This new French law will apply to this kind of public Christian prayer as well as Muslim prayer, so church congregations as well as mosque congregations will be impacted as a result.

This law is being promulgated to defend the French principle of public secularism, not to promote an anti-Islamic agenda.
 
 
 
This, ladies and gentlemen is what we call a fascist.

 

The funny thing is is that it is you who are the actual fascist.
you use the tag fascist to bully and silence people,no matter how moderate who disagree with the statement that immigration is a bad thing.

I've noticed that whenever someone like you is being beaten and outclassed in an argument or debate you always resort to the "you're a fascist" line to end the argument.

Your fooling nobody.
You only have to look around any major european city to see multiculturalism has failed.
 
 
 
Listen to you with your meaningless clichés, "ladies and gentlemen". Oh oh noes I'm a fascist?   That all you got, you Muslim-appeasing Leftist piece of ****?

 

My last post shows how you should have answered that prick
 
 
ah the people saying it "targets muslims" when are the western leftist "liberals" going to stop attaching a false sense of victimhood to muslims?
 
 
 
I don't understand people who believe this is targeted at Muslims. France is an inherently secular nation, and so should be able to impose secular-based laws in its country.

 

Because in practice, it's only Muslims who will actually be effected....
 
 
 
Re-read your post, good old Godwin was peaking in. And clearly you need to look up a definition of Facism by the way.

 

Not really - I aptly pointed out the similarity between your belief in authoritarian rule and 20th Century fascism without invoking any unnecessary comparisons to Hitler. Of course, it's most likely rather convenient for you to avoid that and just say it's Godwins law. Such is the nature of most people who can't bring substance to the table and will use any distraction possible.

 
The problem is all these laws regarding 'inciting hatred' and so forth are geared toward preventing the majority expressing themselves
 

Not really - it affects all people and has no such baring on any one group in particular. Don't like the fact that inciting bigotry is illegal? Tough - if you enjoy openly stated bigotry as much as you say you do, I would suggest limiting yourself to the confines of the Iranian Government board rooms.

as they want to whilst the minorities are almost never subject to them. For instance with Poppy burning, or flag burning there were no convictions of inciting hatred. However when Quran's are burnt there are. Quite the double standard in my opinion.

 
And pray tell then. Why is masturbation more offensive than prayer? You see, you see masturbation as offensive because it is sexual, you sexuality as something to be kept hidden because of socieities' view, and socities' view comes from centuries of backward religious BS.
 

As with all laws there is a slight level of subjective morality and discretion applied. That said, the right to freedom of expression and religious freedom is enshrined in international law and European law alike and as such, the two are not the same regardless of how much of a tantrum you throw because you want all religious people to be suppressed.

 
So if you can logically demonstrate to me why masturbation is more offensive than prayer do so, but bear in mind it has to be logical, and not some vauge feeling of discomfort.
 

Well since 'offence' is not an objective term, you're asking for something which is unattainable. But of course, you would throw in another strawman given the chance. If you actually have a case to state, make it - otherwise admit defeat and move on like the rest of your authoritarian cronies  
 
 
 
Godwin applies to bringing up any irrelevant and extreme analogy to prove your point, "Oi, nihilists if you think there's no right and right what about raping babies?" etc

 

Er, no.

Besides being neither irrelevant nor extreme, the definition is thus:

"Godwin's law (also known as Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies or Godwin's Law of Nazi Analogies)[1][2] is a humorous observation made by Mike Godwin in 1990 that has become an Internet adage. It states: "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1 (100%)." In other words, Godwin put forth the hyperbolic observation that, given enough time, in any online discussion—regardless of topic or scope—someone inevitably criticizes some point made in the discussion by comparing it to beliefs held by Hitler and the Nazis."

It's irrelevant as to what religions are affected, it's a blanket ban, so conceptually, it is secular. Sure, in practice, it's probably targeted, but at least in concept it's not.
 
 
No idea about Islam, but with Christianity believers are told in the gospels to pray in private.

Okay, my question was "Correct me if I am wrong, but does the definition which you have just copied and pasted not perfectly illustrate the concept that this pendulumn bob guy has just described?" Not "Was Godwin's Law about Nihilists and Baby Rapers?"

Now the idea that eventually someone will run out of things to say and attempt to connect one person's premise to the Nazi's in order to discredit what they say is essentially Godwin's Law? The difference between what pendulumnbob said and your attempt at a correction is that he substituted Nazi's for baby rapers whilst still playing on the same concept. Godwin's Law is not "specifically about Hitler/nazi's". It is a humorous observation that arguments descend into farcical name calling, in his example the use of Nazis.

Sorry, I misunderstood what you said the first time, but no - Godwin's law doesn't refer to 'baby rapers', it refers explicitly and specifically to Nazis and Hitler and nothing else.
 
 
The problem is that you've got a shortage of mosques in some areas, causing people to be outside the mosques and pray on the road. This means the roads cannot be used by cars or trucks, impeding the normal circulation in the city.

I support the ban (if you want to pray, but not pay for another building, you can do so at home).
 
 
Vive la France

I support it. I don't comprehend why things such as prayers should be allowed to be conducted in public places, whereas a far more natural thing such as sex shouldn't.

Sigh, you referenced Facism in 20th century Europe, clearly referring to one thing.

Well I tell you what, shall we look at the amount of minorities convicted of 'hate crimes' and such like as opposed to those of the white majority?   Maybe in the letter of the law there is no distinction, but clearly there is in practice.

I see, so your morals should be ok because they are in law already, and mine are wrong because they are not? Well using that same argument certain acts against certain minorities were a-ok by you, in certain facist nations during the 20th century, because they were supported by law?  

And how is that a Strawman? I think you need to look up a definition of Strawman   And so the answer is that there is no logical difference between offence given by the human body and it's functions than there is dogmatic prayer in public, and yet you claim that they are different arbitrarily because of what you have been brought up to believe.

Besides, why would it matter - if you have a look at the black population in American prisons you would note that crime doesn't give much of a **** for political correctness.

Assuming you believe in the rule of law - yes. Yours are wrong because they are immoral - but you have every right to lobby your MP or suggest a motion by writing a letter. Until then the law is meant to be adhered to. Such is the nature of a civil society as opposed to a Fascist dictatorship [very happy to see you're now best friends with Godwin   ].

No - the reality is that you're asking for a quantitative answer to a qualitative question, by its nature a fallacy and is therefore you just substituting a strawman in place of weak debating skills.

  How much longer are you going to try to keep this up - there's not much to you besides a little middle class brat who's trying to 'put muslims in their place' and failing miserably  
 
 
 
Absolutely wrong really. This is merely being driven by a dislike of Muslims and Islam.

I agree that the legislation is a bit on the   side but if you look at the OP's source:

The term: "Muslims, and those of any other faith" isn't even quoted by anyone. It is said so by the Telegraph. The Telegraph is making more of an emphasis on muslims and islam in this article.
 
 
I have never personally seen this myself but I think if Muslims are praying on the street and causing obstruction to others who are walking, then I as a Muslim myself would agree with the ban.

If however, they are praying outside away from others e.g. an enclosed area (park or mosque) that does not cause obstruction to cars or pedestrians then I don't see the problem. To be honest, because it's secular France, we all know what the real intention behind this ban was. I don't think Sarkozy could give two hoots about causing obstruction to pedestrians.

This is hardly a law banning Muslims from practising their own religion. I have lived in a Muslim country for many years and have been free to practise my religion ownly PRIVATELY, despite many of aspects of my religion being "a must" too. I fully appreciate that Islam, as a religion, unfortunately, may be treated with some bias, but unless France disallows planning permission for people who want to build more mosques, I still don't think banning prayers on the street is a bad thing, considering France is a secular state.

What will happen politically because of Islamophobia is not what I am arguing. Legally speaking, I dont think there is anything wrong with it.
 
 
France is a secular country - religion not allowed to be taught in schools etc. So it's up to them really.

Sigh. We know to what you were reffering, don;t try and disguise it.

That's not what I meant and you know it. I mean you take two virtually indentical actions, except with one perpetrated by an ehhtnic minority and one perpatrated by a majority, only one will be accused of a 'hate crime'. As evidenced with issues such as the flag burnings and Poppy burnings and then the opposition Quran burnings. Need I remind which parties were accused of hate crimes and which were not?  

I was simply doing what you did. You refused to acknowledge where you had popped in Godwin so you cannot accuse me of the same. How are mine immoral? Do tell, this should be interesting. And the law is being adhered to. Why are you trying to paint me as some sort of law breaking Neo-Nazi when that clearly is not the case? I'd ask you refrain from such implications in future.

Ehem.

A straw man is a component of an argument and is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position. Now tell me, where have I done that? Oh wait, I have not. So please don;t try and be clever if you have no idea what you are on about, it just looks pathetic.

Of course. Middle Class eh? Well a compliment is always nice. And brat? Well that's just mean. I suppose wanting religious folk to be held to the smae standards as everyone else is just crazy eh? I mean who am I to ask Muslims to follow the law in a Christian society, and who am I as an Atheist to object to their dogmatic performances on public highways? Just a selfish brat.  
 
 
Good. Religion has no place on the streets.
 
 
 
Sigh. We know to what you were reffering, don;t try and disguise it.

 

Not really - I made a reference to 20th Century Fascism in relation to your desire to live in an authoritarian state without making any statements about the Nazis or Hitler. You simply went ahead and threw in a Godwin strawman and can't handle the fact that it was badly placed.

Well poppy burning (as stupid as it is) isn't a hate crime and isn't targeting any specific ethic/racial group or particular nationality. In fact - quite the opposite could be said considering the global nature of the conflict in which Indians/Pakistanis also fought.

You try to target minorities in contravention of both international law, European law and generally speaking, the British tradition of liberty - through the promotion of authoritarian rule and discrimination of minorities. That is immoral.

By asking for a quantitative answer to a qualitative question - that is the strawman. Failing to provide a logical but understandably qualitative argument and using a silly question to avoid any scrutiny. Such is the nature of most amateur debaters.

 
Of course. Middle Class eh? Well a compliment is always nice. And brat? Well that's just mean. I suppose wanting religious folk to be held to the smae standards as everyone else is just crazy eh?
 

They are held to the same standards - you simply have a tin foil hat conspiracy like mentality when it comes to the freedom of religious people and want to instate repressive legislation because of your own insecurities. Ironically, secularism is all about level standardisation by opening up religious freedom and giving everybody, regardless of religious belief - the freedom to express their beliefs openly.

 
I mean who am I to ask Muslims to follow the law in a Christian society, and who am I as an Atheist to object to their dogmatic performances on public highways? Just a selfish brat.  
 

Calling you a brat is in no way meant as a term to state that you don't have the right to express an opinion - but here we go. Another strawman - instead of facing the scrutiny you will falsely blame others for making statements they haven't said in an attempt to scurry away from providing any decent argument. You are a middle class brat because it appears you have lived an incredibly sheltered life and have become so far removed from the sacrifices that people made in the 20th Century against people like you who wanted to turn Britain into a fascist state.

We kicked your arse once and we'll hand it back to you again.
 
 
As long as they aren't literally blocking the way, or preventing others from going about their daily lives, I don't see how praying in public is a problem.  
 
 
 
Not really - I made a reference to 20th Century Fascism in relation to your desire to live in an authoritarian state without making any statements about the Nazis or Hitler. You simply went ahead and threw in a Godwin strawman and can't handle the fact that it was badly placed.

Well poppy burning (as stupid as it is) isn't a hate crime and isn't targeting any specific ethic/racial group or particular nationality. In fact - quite the opposite could be said considering the global nature of the conflict in which Indians/Pakistanis also fought.

You try to target minorities in contravention of both international law, European law and generally speaking, the British tradition of liberty - through the promotion of authoritarian rule and discrimination of minorities. That is immoral.

By asking for a quantitative answer to a qualitative question - that is the strawman. Failing to provide a logical but understandably qualitative argument and using a silly question to avoid any scrutiny. Such is the nature of most amateur debaters.

They are held to the same standards - you simply have a tin foil hat conspiracy like mentality when it comes to the freedom of religious people and want to instate repressive legislation because of your own insecurities. Ironically, secularism is all about level standardisation by opening up religious freedom and giving everybody, regardless of religious belief - the freedom to express their beliefs openly.

Calling you a brat is in no way meant as a term to state that you don't have the right to express an opinion - but here we go. Another strawman - instead of facing the scrutiny you will falsely blame others for making statements they haven't said in an attempt to scurry away from providing any decent argument. You are a middle class brat because it appears you have lived an incredibly sheltered life and have become so far removed from the sacrifices that people made in the 20th Century against people like you who wanted to turn Britain into a fascist state.

We kicked your arse once and we'll hand it back to you again.

 

You clearly have no idea what a Strawman is, stop using the word. Even after I have provided you a definition your are using it incorrectly.  

I disagree, it is clearly a hate crime. Just because it isn't targetted at a single ethnic group of people doesn't make it less so. I mean Muslims are not an ethnic group, and yet it is a hate crime to burn a Quran. They are bonded by delusion, the burning of the Poppies is an attack on the RBL and all servicemen and those associated with them.

How is it discrimination? To actually enforce the law? Obstruction of public highways, causing a public nuisance, causing a public disturbance, they are guilty of all of these things. And clearly there is now precedent for this action, which I completley support. It targets no particular minority, but anyway causing an obstruction in the street, whether that be for prayer or dance. And this isn't an attack on Human Rights or Civil Liberties, I am not asking for them to be stopped from praying, not even to stop them praying in public, merely to not pray on public highways and as such stick to their designated areas for prayer.

No, it is not. Please, I have just provided you a definition of a Strawman Fallacy. Do I need to provide more definitions for you? A Strawman Fallacy is where one party misrepresents the oppositions' argument, either simplifying it or taking it to illogical extremes, and then refutes it without any input from the opponent, creating a 'straman' of the oppenant and his' argument. What you have described is clearly not a Strawman.

Tin foil hat   This is all I want, everyone to be held to the same standards. There are laws about obstructing public highways, causing a public nusiance and all of this, but if these laws are not enforced for fear of being labelled Islamaphobic or something then we should have a clearer law on the matter, ensuring no room for reproach.

And I;ve never made that claim. Oh dear, another inproiper use of the term 'Strawman'. Please, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. I am not a Facist because I don;t want to bend over backward to accomodate any and all and all of their practices at every turn no matter what. It's a pathetic move by bleeding heart liberals, or dare I say it, Muslims, to label any who oppose them Facists. You are just like those UAF wallies, 'everyone who doesn't agree is a Facist!' And by the way, I think you'd find the large majority of those people you group yourself in with as 'we', would take my side over yours everyday. This process of agressive Liberalism wasn't around back then, and that would show in their opinion.
 
 
The debate is far more complicated than it appears. It is not simply about 'racism' against Muslims. There are a range of reasons for France to employ this law, here are the main ones:

1) Laicité, or secularism. It is an extremely prevalent French belief that religion should be kept out of public places. This is basically the separation of church and State. It is enshrined in the Law of 1905, the 1958 constitution and several recent laws demonstrate this drive for secularism, such as the banning of religious symbols in schools, because these are public spaces. The same principle applies to all public places. So it can be viewed that this law simply encourage secularism and the fundamental French belief in laicité.

2) Sarkozy, in a desperate bid to win back voters, has tried to win over the electorate by reopening the secularism debate, and thus this law could be seen as a (cynical) tool to win votes as he is down in the polls and the elections are coming up. As it stands, his party may even finish 3rd to the Front National, the French version of the BNP.

So basically, it could be a pursuit for secularism, or a political ploy that takes advantage of the deep-rooted belief in secularism to win back voters.

That's not to say there aren't other factors, but this is what I can think of.
 
 
 
You clearly have no idea what a Strawman is, stop using the word. Even after I have provided you a definition your are using it incorrectly.  

 

Can't handle being caught red handed so of course you will throw in as many distractions as possible. Tut tut, such amateur debating I haven't seen in quite a while.

 
I disagree, it is clearly a hate crime. Just because it isn't targetted at a single ethnic group of people doesn't make it less so.
 

And herein lies the problem; you don't actually know what 'hate crimes' are and why they were introduced. Hate crimes are not crimes that are endemically 'hateful', but crimes that are hateful and bare relation against a specific race/religion/sexuality etc. This was done in order to give increased sentencing against acts of violence committed under the pretence of racism/religious intolerance etc. It is a hateful crime to burn popies, but it isn't a hate-crime under the clinical definition.

 
I mean Muslims are not an ethnic group, and yet it is a hate crime to burn a Quran.
 

You really are an absolute moron. A hate crime (also known as a bias-motivated crime) can be committed on a number of scales - in this case religion.

 
They are bonded by delusion, the burning of the Poppies is an attack on the RBL and all servicemen and those associated with them.
 

I agree - but its still not a hate crime as it doesn't illicitly attack any specific group which come under the axis of the hate-crime umbrella. The 'RBL' aren't a racial group, religious group, class/nationality/political group etc.

 
How is it discrimination? To actually enforce the law? Obstruction of public highways, causing a public nuisance, causing a public disturbance, they are guilty of all of these things. And clearly there is now precedent for this action, which I completley support.
 

For the millionth time, the pretext for this law is not and has never been stated as a 'road safety law', but under the guise as such: " My vigilance will be unflinching for the law to be applied. Praying in the street is not dignified for religious practice and violates the principles of secularism " - Minister Claude Guéant. Hence why we're having this discussion you complete dolt.

 
It targets no particular minority, but anyway causing an obstruction in the street, whether that be for prayer or dance.
 

Except it specifically targets Muslims and dancing isn't mentioned anywhere in the legislation or press reports by French Ministers. You're now making things up as you can see your own argument fail under its weakness.

 
And this isn't an attack on Human Rights or Civil Liberties, I am not asking for them to be stopped from praying, not even to stop them praying in public, merely to not pray on public highways and as such stick to their designated areas for prayer.
 

It is, whether you'd like to admit it or not, a direct contravention of the European principals which state that religious freedom and freedom or religious expression is enshrined in the laws of all European Union nations which have ratified the Lisbon Treaty, which includes France.

 
No, it is not. Please, I have just provided you a definition of a Strawman Fallacy. Do I need to provide more definitions for you?

What you have described is clearly not a Strawman.
 

So when you asked whether prayer is equally as offensive as public masturbation - you weren't taking my argument to an illogical extreme as a means of avoiding the actual scrutiny of the argument itself?  

Check Mate son.

If that's what this law was - that would be one thing. But road safety has not been mentioned once by French Ministers. You're simply just reading your own opinion into this law in order to justify your bigoted ends.

 
And I;ve never made that claim. Oh dear, another inproiper use of the term 'Strawman'. Please, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.

Ah yes, the good old 'My imaginary friends would agree with me so nurrrr' argument. Is that why the streets of Tower Hamlets ring with the sound of religious freedom? All your EDL fascist nutcases winning huh? Of course - you would use any distraction in order to avoid the scrutiny of my crushing arguments. Face it - you've been annihilated by my points and the best you can do is make nonsense statements about 'the public is on my side'.

You've been destroyed, no go home pal

My dear, this isn't a spelling or grammar correction designed mto distract, I merely informing you that you are using entirely the wrong term for something. Which I consider rather poor form in any debate or discussion.

So once again I'd ask you to demonstrate a logical difference between burning the Poppy and burning the Quran, and why one is hate a crime and the other is not.

Well then of course you see my problem. For I don't see why the RBL is differant to Muslims. Muslims are not an ethnic group, they are a group united only by a common ideaology. Something which the RBL also have in common.

Well religious practice isn't dignified. But the point is rather that in this country public praying such as was seen is already outlawed through various other laws, but the authorities are too scared to act for fear of being labelled facists by limp wristed liberals such as yourself. But I do compltely agree with the French minister.

I'm talking about the transportation of this law to Britain, as was the original onus for the discussion I started. And I have already outlined why religious practices need a specific law for them.

And noone is infringing those rights.   Merely this is stopping obstructive and intrusive religious practices on public grounds.

No I was not, I was asking for some logical distinction, of which there is none. Which was my point. At no point did I misrepresent your argument, which is required for something to be a Strawman Fallacy.

Annihalated? Only in your warped little mind sonny. And no, those streets certainly don;t, not since nut case Islamists took them over. And you made the claim 'we' crushed you before and would do so again, clearly far more ridiculous than my claim that they would be on my side. So when you introduce such an appeal you lose all right to label it ridiculous when turned against you, you most dreadful hypocrite.

Of course you would say that, but then - you've dilly dallied from point to point, dropping everything of substance after I've annihilated you. What was that about Godwin's law? Oh yes - you dropped that after, like so much of your rather non-existent argument, I obliterated you.

 
So once again I'd ask you to demonstrate a logical difference between burning the Poppy and burning the Quran, and why one is hate a crime and the other is not.
 

One targets a specific religious group whereas the other targets no such group.

Well you're a bit of a moron then.

 
Muslims are not an ethnic group, they are a group united only by a common ideaology. Something which the RBL also have in common.
 

No, one is a religion - the other is a charitable organisation - not an 'ideology'.

 
Well religious practice isn't dignified.
 

You're allowed to think that as much as you like - but you're not allowed to promote bigoted laws that limit the freedom of minorities.

 
But the point is rather that in this country public praying such as was seen is already outlawed through various other laws, but the authorities are too scared to act for fear of being labelled facists by limp wristed liberals such as yourself. But I do compltely agree with the French minister.
 

Or maybe - the more logical answer; our democracy shows that more people agree with me  

Or perhaps it really is the tin foil hat job you've so eloquently described  

 
I'm talking about the transportation of this law to Britain, as was the original onus for the discussion I started. And I have already outlined why religious practices need a specific law for them.
 

Unfortunately for you - we outlawed fascism and pushed your lot back to the dark ages with a spank from Churchill, Uncle Sam and the millions of Indians/Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who fought you. Today, as a result - we have our freedoms enshrined in such laws as the ECHR - and such a transportation will never happen.

 
And noone is infringing those rights.   Merely this is stopping obstructive and intrusive religious practices on public grounds.
 

Again, this is completely fabricated foresight that has been made up by you and has not been iterated whatsoever by any French official or representative.

 
No I was not, I was asking for some logical distinction, of which there is none. Which was my point. At no point did I misrepresent your argument, which is required for something to be a Strawman Fallacy.
 

If you need someone to define the difference between personal introspection and sexual gratification - you are by your own admission an idiot. But time and time again - you will use that as a representation of my argument - taking it to vast extremes (such as the idea that prayer = masturbation) and then try to weasel out of the scrutiny of my arguments.   Strawman.

Not particularly - the tradition of the liberal alliance goes back to the Second World War. Muslims and non-Muslims fought your type and such an allegory would be just as fitting today. We are united in the same way that when that audience turned on Nick Griffin on Question Time, we could see the whites of his eyes sparkle with fear. An emotion we will inspire in you when we crush fascists like you once again  

Check. Mate.

 
 
 
I don't agree with the measure but what I'd like to see is the Government take steps to help alleviate the reasons that led to the banning of public prayer. Let's not kid ourselves, this is about Islamic prayer. Mostly to do with Friday prayers I imagine.

Responsible action on the Government's part would be to examine the reason why Muslims end up praying outside of mosques. Mosque quantity and size are not sufficient. As far as I'm aware, there is a lack of mosques in France and furthermore, the size of these mosques are not that of which is required. What I'd like to see is the Government actively work on expanding the overall indoor prayer space in the coming years. You don't just tell people with no other choice to 'stop praying outdoors' and leave it at that. Guidelines should be given in the meantime, and long term projects should be embarked on.

Secular doesn't mean you have the right to handicap what happens to be a sizable minority of your country. Secular governance should end up in all religions/atheists being treated equally and the concerns and needs of each addressed.

Right, so calling out where you have clearly failed is wrong. I see. My mistake   And I dropped the point about Godwins law because I don;t see the point in beating a dead horse. Although that said, I don;t know why I'm still enagaing you. I say the same thing, perfectly clearly, and you come back with the same condescending repoly every time, refusing to acknowledge your own mistakes and repeating yourself. It really is sub par.

I see, so one targets a religious group, and the other targets a group of people bound by the sacrifice of their loved ones. And you deem an imaginary friend as a linkage of far greater importance than blood sacrifice for Queen and country?

Well, I'm sure Nudists would say the same about certain laws we have now. And as we have seen, you are unable to logically come up with a reason to oppose them, so if I am a Facist and a bigot, so are you my dear.

You said 'we' beat you before, clearly referring to those who fought in WWII as per your early reference to 20th century Facism. I am telling you that infact, they would agree with me over you every single day of the week.

 

I'm sorry, fabrictaed? Are you totally retarded? A law that merely prohibits public worship in public spaces does not infringe religious freedom. How the hell is that fabrictaed? Are you saying that a banning of knives in public would ban them everywhere else aswell? My gosh, you bring new depths of stupidity to TSR.

Once again I'd advise you to look up the definition of Strawman, what you are describing would infact be an entirley different fallacy, but regardless that is not what I;ve done. You see I;ve asked for a logical equation, not taken the argument to illogical extremes. You see prayer is but mental masturbation, affirmation of what you already know for your self gratification. And I find it as offensive as masturbation. I don't think either should be permitted on public land.

Muslims also fought against the Allies. As did many other people. And clearly you're liberal mind has lost all sense. If you honestly think that the people of 1945 would side with you over me in this issue. You see back then we still had Nationalk pride, we didn't have this PC nonsense. And back then they knew what Facism was, Nazis were Facists, I am no facist. As I've said, you are typical Muslim/UAF, anyone that doesn't agree with psuedo liberal appologist PC agenda is a Facist! And should be silenced! It's pathetic.

I'm sorry, but I have to disagree. It's not the government's problem if you don;t have space to worship, it is the governments problem when you infringe other people's rights, block public highways and so on. So whilst they are perfectly within their rights with this new legislation, they have no obligation to pander to people's delusion and waste government time and reasource on housing them.

So whilst they are perfectly within their rights with this new legislation, they have no obligation to pander to people's delusion and waste government time and reasource on housing them.

 

What about the rights of the religious? Their right to practice their religion? Should this be ignored? For a Muslim male, it is mandatory for him to attend Friday prayers. Fair enough, the government has imposed a ban which protects 'other people's rights' and the free flow of traffic but if the government then ignores the needs Muslims, this ban ultimately denies Muslims the right to prayer.

Why shouldn't the government care for the needs of Muslims as you suggest? They are a part of the nation and voted for the government and therefore they are entitled to at the very least, the basic right to worship in a proper manner.
 
 
Two things about this, one is that it seems intolerant, I don't see how people praying are hurting anyone else. The other is that despite it saying that the ban extends to all faiths, there seems to be an emphasis on Muslims, suggesting that when put into practice they could be discriminated against i.e. it will be enforced on them more than it will on others.
 
 
 
Right, so calling out where you have clearly failed is wrong. I see. My mistake   And I dropped the point about Godwins law because I don;t see the point in beating a dead horse.

You're still engaging me because you're trying to save face. It's rarely becoming to see someone so adamantly rehash the same jumbled rhetoric about 'street safety' despite the fact that you've been regularly flogged by my arguments. You're talking about 'mistakes' but yet constantly can't seem to conjure any reference to a mistake I've made - all this coming from the man who has subsequently dropped point after point to demonstrate my superiority over you. How does that feel?  

 
I see, so one targets a religious group, and the other targets a group of people bound by the sacrifice of their loved ones. And you deem an imaginary friend as a linkage of far greater importance than blood sacrifice for Queen and country?
 

RBL is a charity; not an ideology, not a group, not a 'minority' etc. and as such is open to expression which would not be condoned if they came under the umbrella of a group of which it is possible to commit a hate-crime against. Even a monkey could tell you that. Is this an admission of your own stupidity?  

Oh, and the Queen can go **** herself  

 
Well, I'm sure Nudists would say the same about certain laws we have now. And as we have seen, you are unable to logically come up with a reason to oppose them, so if I am a Facist and a bigot, so are you my dear.
 

Ladies and Gentleman, another Strawman! This time featuring 'Religious Freedom = Displays of Open Nudity!'. I will nevertheless continue on obliterating you as I have continued to do so throughout this discussion. As stated earlier, all laws carry with them a certain level of discretion; and in a civil society, this is known as boundaries of reason. A minority of people may want to strip and be openly nude, but the majority of people have the desire to be able to freely express themselves and that explains why we have the laws we have.

 
You said 'we' beat you before, clearly referring to those who fought in WWII as per your early reference to 20th century Facism. I am telling you that infact, they would agree with me over you every single day of the week.
 

The allied forces fought against fascism, against authoritarian rule, against the idea that religious freedom is an abomination. Believe me - I doubt anyone would have had you besides the clutches of Fascists. But then, I'm sure you consider yourself the posterboy of conservatism given your extreme stance on Muslims   Nick Griffin fodder if ever I did see one.

 
I'm sorry, fabrictaed? Are you totally retarded? A law that merely prohibits public worship in public spaces does not infringe religious freedom. How the hell is that fabrictaed? Are you saying that a banning of knives in public would ban them everywhere else aswell? My gosh, you bring new depths of stupidity to TSR.
 

Only you could fail to interpret the most basic of sentences. For what must be at the very least the fifth or sixth time, no French official has made any statement regarding this as a legislation for the sake of road safety; it is point blank an issue of French suppression of minorities under the banner of what the far right perceive to be 'French values'. Your reading into the law and then subsequent re-writing of its meaning is the fabrication in question.

 
Once again I'd advise you to look up the definition of Strawman, what you are describing would infact be an entirley different fallacy, but regardless that is not what I;ve done. You see I;ve asked for a logical equation, not taken the argument to illogical extremes. You see prayer is but mental masturbation, affirmation of what you already know for your self gratification. And I find it as offensive as masturbation. I don't think either should be permitted on public land.
 

Ah here we go with the same old beaten track of you throwing a tantrum because you're being called out for your repetitive use of Strawman fallacies. Prayer is a form of introspection and Masturbation is a form of sexual gratification - in the eyes of those who Pray, I would assume they are doing it for their respective deities. But of course, someone like yourself will use the two, trying to make them seem akin in order to avoid any real scrutiny of your paper thin arguments. You find it offensive? Tough titties, go live in North Korea or Iran. This is Britain. My Britain, the country which values Liberty and we would never let you get your grips on it.

 
Muslims also fought against the Allies. As did many other people.
 

Like the Muslims of Bosnia, Algeria, India/Pakistan/Bangladesh, Palestine who fought alongside Brits against your lot to secure freedom? Yes, those awful awful Muslims   You better kiss the feet of Muslims and thank them for saving your grandparents' arses.

 
And clearly you're liberal mind has lost all sense. If you honestly think that the people of 1945 would side with you over me in this issue. You see back then we still had Nationalk pride, we didn't have this PC nonsense. And back then they knew what Facism was, Nazis were Facists, I am no facist. As I've said, you are typical Muslim/UAF, anyone that doesn't agree with psuedo liberal appologist PC agenda is a Facist! And should be silenced! It's pathetic.
 

In all honesty, if you need to believe that the Allies would have sided with you on oppressing minorities in order to get to sleep, go ahead. I find it laughable you need this justification. The fact is, our liberal heritage is known and established for enshrining the rights of Muslims and non-Muslims to practice and pray openly. We didn't need to hide under the banner of 'National Pride' in order to beat minorities into submission. Alas, we took our gun out and we made sure each and every single one of you was executed. We exposed Oswald Mosely, we exposed Mussolini, we exposed Adolf Hitler, and today - I have exposed you.

 
 
 
 
What about the rights of the religious? Their right to practice their religion? Should this be ignored? For a Muslim male, it is mandatory for him to attend Friday prayers. Fair enough, the government has imposed a ban which protects 'other people's rights' and the free flow of traffic but if the government then ignores the needs Muslims, this ban ultimately denies Muslims the right to prayer.

Why shouldn't the government care for the needs of Muslims as you suggest? They are a part of the nation and voted for the government and therefore they are entitled to at the very least, the basic right to worship in a proper manner.

 

They are not infringing these rights. In a secular country the government has no obligation to pander to such nonsense. If they need a place to worship that is their problem, not the governments. Not heling is a completley different thing to activley being against.

 
You're still engaging me because you're trying to save face. It's rarely becoming to see someone so adamantly rehash the same jumbled rhetoric about 'street safety' despite the fact that you've been regularly flogged by my arguments. You're talking about 'mistakes' but yet constantly can't seem to conjure any reference to a mistake I've made - all this coming from the man who has subsequently dropped point after point to demonstrate my superiority over you. How does that feel?  

RBL is a charity; not an ideology, not a group, not a 'minority' etc. and as such is open to expression which would not be condoned if they came under the umbrella of a group of which it is possible to commit a hate-crime against. Even a monkey could tell you that. Is this an admission of your own stupidity?  

Oh, and the Queen can go **** herself  

Ladies and Gentleman, another Strawman! This time featuring 'Religious Freedom = Displays of Open Nudity!'. I will nevertheless continue on obliterating you as I have continued to do so throughout this discussion. As stated earlier, all laws carry with them a certain level of discretion; and in a civil society, this is known as boundaries of reason. A minority of people may want to strip and be openly nude, but the majority of people have the desire to be able to freely express themselves and that explains why we have the laws we have.

The allied forces fought against fascism, against authoritarian rule, against the idea that religious freedom is an abomination. Believe me - I doubt anyone would have had you besides the clutches of Fascists. But then, I'm sure you consider yourself the posterboy of conservatism given your extreme stance on Muslims   Nick Griffin fodder if ever I did see one.

Only you could fail to interpret the most basic of sentences. For what must be at the very least the fifth or sixth time, no French official has made any statement regarding this as a legislation for the sake of road safety; it is point blank an issue of French suppression of minorities under the banner of what the far right perceive to be 'French values'. Your reading into the law and then subsequent re-writing of its meaning is the fabrication in question.

Ah here we go with the same old beaten track of you throwing a tantrum because you're being called out for your repetitive use of Strawman fallacies. Prayer is a form of introspection and Masturbation is a form of sexual gratification - in the eyes of those who Pray, I would assume they are doing it for their respective deities. But of course, someone like yourself will use the two, trying to make them seem akin in order to avoid any real scrutiny of your paper thin arguments. You find it offensive? Tough titties, go live in North Korea or Iran. This is Britain. My Britain, the country which values Liberty and we would never let you get your grips on it.

Like the Muslims of Bosnia, Algeria, India/Pakistan/Bangladesh, Palestine who fought alongside Brits against your lot to secure freedom? Yes, those awful awful Muslims   You better kiss the feet of Muslims and thank them for saving your grandparents' arses.

In all honesty, if you need to believe that the Allies would have sided with you on oppressing minorities in order to get to sleep, go ahead. I find it laughable you need this justification. The fact is, our liberal heritage is known and established for enshrining the rights of Muslims and non-Muslims to practice and pray openly.

We exposed Oswald Mosely, we exposed Mussolini, we exposed Adolf Hitler, and today - I have exposed you.

 

 

You're not even making sense now. How does my dropping a point you refuse to see sense on show your superiority? Perhaps it shows you have a little more stamina for such weary things, but other than that?

You make me sick. So because a group doesn't share a skin colour or a delusion they should not have the same protection as those that profess belief in some ancient deity? The RBL deserve ten times the protection Islam does. Eugh. Just showing your true colours now.

Oh you are making a fool of yourself. You clearly have no idea what a Strawman Fallacy is. And yes, you have demonstarated why we have the law, but no sound logical reason behind one action being offensive and the other not, which was my point.

Clearly holding everyone to the standards is now a Facist belief according to you. Good to know. Liberal apologists like you make me sick to my stomach.

And that answer was in answer to you point about something being fabrictaed. Such as it was you claimed my statement of 'it's not banning religious worship or infringing their rights, just banning it in public spaces' was somehow 'fabrictaed', which is beyond ridiculous. You can;t even keep up a coherent argument now.

And I have clearly made the point that Prayer is just another form of self gratification. One I deem akin to spiritual masturbation. Your Britain? Please, this is more my Britain than it will ever be yours so long as I draw breath.

I'll kiss noonse's feet thankyou very much. My point was that there were Muslims on both sides of the conflict. And by that logic every Muslim should kiss every Christian soldiers feet that saved their lives? It really is a non-point, the typical apologist rhetoric you always get from your sort.

There's that 'we' again. But as I have said, I am no Facist, I am just standing up for equal treatment. The people of that day saw real Facism and know it's face, and mine and it's are not the same. This pathetic repeating of the statement does not make it true. I have no wish to oppress the minorities, to exterminate them. I just espouse their equal treatment, and as such they should not have the right to obstruct the area with their offensive dogma.
 
 
 
Frances stance on secularism is that religion belongs out of the public gaze, and behind closed doors.

 

But religion is not just one tiny aspect of a person that they can shut away at home and leave behind every time they go out to work/school, it's a way of life! And what is the worst that can happen if some French dude walking down the street sees an "explicit display of religion" like someone wearing a cross necklace or a Sikh wearing a Turban, or a Muslim girl wearing a headscarf?

This topic is not about wearing a headscarf or turban, it is about praying in the street. And scenes like this have caused the French government to outlaw it.

 
 
 
Much as I love France and the French language, how are their children etc going to learn tolerance if they keep banning everything to do with religion? I think it's fair enough, to an extent, banning the veil if it stops abuse (though maybe they should make support for Muslim women suffering abuse more available?) but what's in the point in banning prayer? It doesn't hurt anyone does it?  
 
 
This is such a French solution - where an American might want to make everyone equally free, the French are content for everyone to be equally unfree.

It would be better to privatise the streets, all things considered. It will tend to result in them being used for their purpose without an overweening central authority being able to use them to control people.
 
 
 
Edit: If you're gonna neg, at least leave a reason why. But no. You people just neg because I make you mad and you can't counter my points. HAHA! Fools...

 

....because you're a douchelord
 
 
The U.K does not have this Law and there are no 'prayer' related problems on these streets.
I think this is just unessessary legislation which is bound to cause anger and tension.
 
 
 
Absolutely wrong really. This is merely being driven by a dislike of Muslims and Islam. Images of people praying being forced off the streets is going to do wonders for Frances international image as a free western democracy

 

democracy =/= 100% freedom
 
 
 
....because you're a douchelord

 

And this, ladies and gentlemen, is a prime example of the fools I speak of.

Please note the lack of intelligent application of the words (since this fragment of a sentence doesn't make sense as a reply to the quote) and also note the use of the "word" `douchelord`, showing a probable low IQ as an argument was not able to be formed.

I don't hate you. You're just a failure of the system/your parents.

lol I'm so st00pid

It doesn't retract from my initial point...

'The system'? HAHAHA

Like I said, if Muslims are praying outside causing obstruction, then I don't agree with it and they shouldn't really be doing it anyway -- but is not this picture after the French ban, when people were praying outside in protest of the prayer ban?

Not a free country anymore.

Sure, by all means legislation against gathering in certain places without permission; but an outright ban on praying is just absurd, and is as unenforceable as it is totalitarian.

I mean, what constitutes "prayer" anyway, if I was to be sitting quietly on a bench with a Rosary, how would that cause anyone offense?

 

Is it not the case that the ban only covers roads (silly place to be praying anyway)?  
 
 
It makes sense. They are a secular state and people praying in the streets / roads are obstructing people from going about their normal business.

Don't like it? Find a non-secular state to live in. Simple.

I must admit that I didn't read into it too carefully, clearly a ban against praying in the road is a lot more lax than a ban against praying in public per se. However, I still do occasionally pray whilst walking across the street - I don't ever stop whilst I am doing it though, so I doubt they would even know what I was doing.
 
 
It's the right thing to do...... roads shouldn't be converted due to one group into a mass prayer, it's not for praying simple as, it's not against "rights"
 
 
LOL Colonial backlash. Fail.

Are you dyslexic?  

Nice way of avoiding the question.
