Friend --

Last weekend, tens of thousands of people attended Unite for Change meetings in all 50 states.

These meetings connected Obama supporters, Democrats who supported other candidates in the primary, Independents, and even some Republicans.

They came together to talk about the change this country desperately needs and form the fundamental building blocks of change in their communities.

Check out this video we put together from events all over the country and share it with your friends:

http://my.barackobama.com/ufcvideo

Unite for Change was an incredible display of the strength of our grassroots movement and the power of Americans to unite around our common desire for change.

No one of us can change this country alone.

That's why it's so important to bring Democrats, Independents, and Republicans who are tired of the politics of the past together to plan how to organize their neighborhoods.

Here are some stories we heard from people who participated in Unite for Change events this weekend:

"Obama attracts really great folks.  Our small apartment had 18 of us all chatting about Obama and the good to come nationally and even locally.  During the DVD, my 2 year old kept saying 'that's Obama' whenever we saw our candidate.  For those of us here in the reddest state it is very affirming to see others supporting a good cause and speaking freely and about the change this country needs. I really feel like we did some good for Obama and for ourselves today.  His community organizer roots were showing because we had a room full of the young and young at heart being involved politically for the first time."
-- Amylouise in Coeur d'Alene, ID

"About thirty-five Obama supporters, former Clinton supporters, Republicans, and Independents gathered in Key West, the southernmost point in the United States.  A number admitted that they have not been active in politics for forty years, and the two youngest got extremely choked up as they described friends in Iraq. People left with a commitment to register voters, hold future house parties, get out the vote, and do whatever they can to elect Democrats all the way down the ticket."
-- Beverly in Key West, FL

"I had over 50 show, with others wanting to come!! A wonderful gathering of friends, community members, neighbors (even my son's first grade teacher) and lots of new faces in my house, coming together to see how they could become part of the process of change they are feeling with Barack Obama.  I am so grateful for the opportunity to show my two children, ages 5 and 7, that this is how America works. Thank you for the opportunity to help. I look forward to more in the future."
-- Walker in Sherman Oaks, CA

"We met neighbors that we had never met.  We all shared one common goal -- black, white, old, young, all united for change.  Wow! It was magical to see our young college students and graduates so involved and it was rewarding to see our seniors revitalized and charged with enthusiasm and hope.  We can't wait until the next event on Independence Day."
-- Barbara in Birmingham, AL

Watch the video of Unite for Change events like these and see how exciting it can be to get involved in your community:

Working together, we can have a huge impact -- not just on the election, but on the way politics works in America.

Thanks for your support,

Friend --

I wanted you to be the first to hear the news.

At the Democratic National Convention next month, we're going to kick off the general election with an event that opens up the political process the same way we've opened it up throughout this campaign.

Barack has made it clear that this is your convention, not his.

On Thursday, August 28th, he's scheduled to formally accept the Democratic nomination in a speech at the convention hall in front of the assembled delegates.

Instead, Barack will leave the convention hall and join more than 75,000 people for a huge, free, open-air event where he will deliver his acceptance speech to the American people.

It's going to be an amazing event, and Barack would like you to join him. Free tickets will become available as the date approaches, but we've reserved a special place for a few of the people who brought us this far and who continue to drive this campaign.

If you make a donation of $5 or more between now and midnight on July 31st, you could be one of 10 supporters chosen to fly to Denver and spend two days and nights at the convention, meet Barack backstage, and watch his acceptance speech in person.  Each of the ten supporters who are selected will be able to bring one guest to join them.

Make a donation now and you could have a front row seat to history:

https://donate.barackobama.com/yourconvention

We'll follow up with more details on this and other convention activities as we get closer, but please take a moment and pass this note to someone you know who might like to be there.

It will be an event you'll never forget.

Thank you,

David
