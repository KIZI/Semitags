First let me admit that I've barely seen any football this year. So my
impressions might not be all that.

But FSU was supposed to have a pretty good defense. They beat Boston
College and held LSU and others to low scores even if they did lose.

Anyway, the Gators were practically unstoppable. Several times, they'd
get into a situation where they needed 15 yards for a first down,
often due to an offsides penalty or whatever, but they'd get the first
down anyway.

On one drive, they got at least 10 yards on five consecutive first
downs, before Tebow ran it in from the five yard line.

Are the Gators that good?

They weren't so great at stopping FSU, although they did keep them out
of the end zone for 60 minutes. But that Gator offense looked like
they were playing against a freshman team, they moved the ball so
easily.

You've got a point. Technically, they did hold LSU scoreless.
