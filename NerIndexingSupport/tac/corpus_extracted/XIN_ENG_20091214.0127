The Philippine government on Monday welcomed the reported removal of Communist
Party of the Philippines founder Jose Ma. Sison from the European Union (EU)
terrorist blacklist, as this may pave the way for the resumption of peace talks
between the government and the National Democratic Front (NDF).

"Hopefully this will lead to good things as far as the peace process with them.
This is really what we are concerned about here in the Philippines, the
resumption of the peace negotiations with the Left," Deputy Presidential
Spokesperson Gary Olivar said in a news briefing.

The NDF has been demanding Sison's exclusion from the EU terror watchlist as a
precondition to the resumption of formal negotiations.

"We are hopeful that Mr. Sison, given this latest improvement in his
circumstances abroad, will now be in a better position to assist in facilitating
the peace process between the CPP-NDF on one hand and the Philippine government
on the other. That is our fervent hope," Olivar said.

The resumption of formal peace talks between the government and the NDF was
supposed to be held in Oslo, Norway on Aug. 28, 2009 but was canceled after the
NDF demanded the release of 14 political detainees as a precondition, which was
rejected by the government as it would undermine the country's justice system.
