 
 
*fancy* vacation ideas....
 
 
We have about 10 days to go anywhere a short trip from Heathrow this summer... some ideas include Morocco, Ireland, Holand, South of France, Sardinia etc.
Any suggestions? The boys will be traveling with us.
We'll be taking them to Lapland in December.
 
 
Oh! Morocco!
 
 
Azores?
 
 
I would go to Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece or Turkey and spend some time in the cities and the coast.
 
 
Morocco!
I visited Spain on a school trip and one of our optional day excursions was Morocco. Our school went with 3 other schools. Our teacher was fine with us going to Morocco, until she spoke with a teacher from another school who told her that there are thieves in Morocco so he wasn't allowing his students to go. We found out less than 12 hours before we were supposed to go that we were no longer allowed to go. Therefore, I vow that I will visit someday.

Cinque Terre and Florence
 
 
Capri
Canary Islands (also place of one of the most fatal plane accidents in the world, but try to look past that)
 
 
Iceland was a great trip for us and is also a short flight.

Ireland summers offer mild weather so I would suggest there. Ireland is great for families as well and the kids can really get out and run around
Italy is amazing but hot in the summer, as is France, Spain.... Of course there may be spots in the mountains that are less hot than the popular cities (Paris, Barcelona, Rome, etc)
