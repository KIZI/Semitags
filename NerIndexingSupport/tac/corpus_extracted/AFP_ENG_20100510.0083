US sales of smartphones running Google's Android mobile operating system surged
past those of Apple for the first time in the first quarter of the year,
industry research firm NPD said Monday.

Android-powered smartphones accounted for 28 percent of US consumer sales in the
first three months of the year compared with 21 percent for the iPhone, NPD
said.

Canada's Research in Motion, maker of the popular Blackberry, retained the top
spot with 36 percent of US smartphone sales in the quarter, NPD said.

Strong sales of Motorola's Android-powered Droid and HTC's Android-based Droid
Eris were cited as among the reasons for Android's surge past Apple.

Google makes its open-source Android software available to handset manufacturers
and also sells its own smartphone, the Nexus One.

"As in the past, carrier distribution and promotion have played a crucial role
in determining smartphone market share," said Ross Rubin, NPD's executive
director of industry analysis.

According to NPD, smartphone sales at AT&T, the exclusive US carrier for the
iPhone, comprised 32 percent of the smartphone market in the quarter, followed
by Verizon Wireless (30 percent), T-Mobile (17 percent) and Sprint (15 percent).

NPD also said the average selling price for all mobile phones was 88 dollars in
the first quarter, five percent higher than a year ago. Smartphone prices on the
other hand decreased three percent over the previous year to 151 dollars.

The NPD findings are based on the results of online consumer research surveys
conducted each month. The sales figures do not include corporate or enterprise
mobile phone sales.

Apple has sold more than 50 million iPhones since introducing the device in
2007.
