Spurs are said to have made a Â£10 million bid for Riquelme and his
agent, Marcos Franchi, told Radio La Red: "Despite that we haven't
been told anything officially, we know that Villarreal has received a
very important offer from Tottenham and that the president Fernando
Roig is analysing it.

"They have to make a decision before August 31, otherwise Riquelme
will stay at Villarreal as there aren't any other serious
negotiations.

"If nothing new appears I think that they should accept this offer as
it is good for the club and the player.

"I don't think that Riquelme would be useful for Villarreal without
playing.

"It would be much more useful for them to sell him so they recover
what they invested in him when they bought him."

Great buy for that money I'd say he is top 2 Free kick takers in the
world. Always running him and Jeans will run over 20 miles in a game.
The only thing I worry about is he might ject get kicked all game in
the center of the park in the PL
