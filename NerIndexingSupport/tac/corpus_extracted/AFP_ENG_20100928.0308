The surprise resignation of Kosovo's president could plunge the territory into
political crisis and early elections, delaying the start of EU-brokered talks
with Belgrade, media said Tuesday.

Kosovo "without a doubt entered into a political and government crisis," the
Zeri Daily said in its editorial commentary.

"Now, the country is at the crossroads," Koha Ditore warned.

President Fatmir Sejdiu stepped down suddenly Monday after the constitutional
court ruled that he could not hold the post of president of his Democratic
League of Kosovo (LDK) while in office.

Koha Ditore said the president's resignation would have a negative impact on the
governing coalition's stability which could pave the way for early elections as
well as postponing talks with Serbia.

"The resignation of Fatmir Sejdiu from the post of the president could present
the country with early elections," the daily said.

It "would have a direct effect in postponing the talks between Kosovo and
Serbia, which at the least will not begin soon as expected."

The resignation comes as Kosovo is due to resume talks with Serbia, which has
never formally accepted the independence of its former province.

Kosovo declared its independence in 2008 and, despite Serbia's fierce
opposition, is recognised by 70 countries including the United States and the
majority of European Union members.

Pristina was given a boost in July when the United Nation's highest court, the
International Court of Justice, ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence
did not violate international law.

Earlier this month Belgrade agreed to hold EU-facilitated talks with Pristina to
try to pave the way for both to join the European Union.

Serbia's President Boris Tadic told the UN General Assembly at the weekend that
the talks would start "soon" but no date has been set.
