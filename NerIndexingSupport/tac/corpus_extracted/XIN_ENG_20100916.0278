WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- A chorus of critical voices gathered more
strength in the United States on Wednesday over a bill on pressuring China to
revalue its currency.

Commenting on the proposed Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, Representative
Lynn Jenkins warned at a congressional hearing that such measures would backfire
on the U.S. economy and trigger more job losses.

The Chinese market for American agricultural products has continued to expand
and U.S. agricultural exports to China have nearly doubled in the past six
years, said Jenkins, whose home state Kansas is known as the "Wheat State" and
relies heavily on farm exports.

China's importation of Kansas goods "not only helps farmers, also keeps the
grocery stores, pharmacies, insurance agencies and service stations in
business," she added.

Any action the United States might take to push China to revalue its currency
must be considered "in the broader context of how it will affect the entire U.S.
economy," the congresswoman stressed.

China is currently the third largest export market for the United States, and
economists believe that the two economies are closely inter-connected.

Yet with the U.S. unemployment rate hovering at 10 percent and congressional
elections approaching, some U.S. industry leaders and congressmen have recently
ratcheted up pressure on Beijing, urging China to steeply revalue its currency.

Lashing out at allegations that such a move would help U.S. save more jobs,
Jenkins said many proposals beyond reducing federal deficits could actually
"hamper agriculture markets, raise prices for U.S. manufacturers and further
threaten U.S. jobs."

Meanwhile, most trade lawyers believe that addressing the exchange rate with
countervailing duties would violate the World Trade Organization rules, said
John Frisbie, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.

"China's exchange rate appreciated nearly 20 percent between 2005 and 2008, but
the U.S. trade deficit with China grew during this time," he told the hearing.

In July, China announced a plan to further proceed with its reform of the yuan
exchange rate regime to enhance the exchange rate flexibility.

"We often hear the claim that trade with China has cost 2.4 million U.S. jobs.
This claim is based on the faulty premise that everything we import from China
would be made in the United States otherwise. That's clearly an erroneous
assumption and undermines the credibility of the number," Frisbie added.

The critical remarks came one day after 36 major U.S. business organizations,
including the American Chamber of Commerce in China and the Business Roundtable,
called for the exclusion of the proposed bill.

"We strongly oppose legislation that would allow the use of either the anti-
dumping or countervailing duty law to address currency concerns," they said in a
joint letter.

The letter was addressed to Sander Levin, chairman of the House of
Representatives Ways and Means Committee, whose panel called the ongoing two-day
hearing.

Calman Cohen, president of the U.S. Emergency Committee For American Trade
(ECAT), said that on behalf of the members of the ECAT, he expressed "strong
opposition" to the proposal.

The bill will lead to "fewer opportunities for U.S. exports and sales into
China's market", said Cohen, adding that U.S. exports to China had quadrupled
since 2000, making China the fastest- growing export market for the United
States.

The ECAT's members represent a broad array of sectors in the U.S. economy,
including agriculture, finance, high technology, manufacturing, publishing and
among others.
