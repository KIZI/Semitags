Mergel brings contemporary vision to MFA from ICA

Jen Mergel is thrilled that the MFA's contemporary gallery space
will jump
from 4,500 square feet to about 17,000.

After searching around the world for more than a year, the
Museum of Fine
Arts found a new curator of contemporary art about 2 miles away.

Jen Mergel, 33, now associate curator at the Institute of
Contemporary Art,
will arrive at the MFA in February, at a critical moment for
Boston's
biggest museum. In November, the MFA will open a huge new wing. And
in
2011, as part of a long-planned $500 million expansion, the MFA
will devote
its existing West Wing to contemporary art, a major step for an
institution
that has been criticized for not devoting enough attention to
contemporary
work. The museum's contemporary gallery space will nearly
quadruple,
jumping from 4,500 square feet to about 17,000.

"They're planning on devoting a quarter of their campus to
contemporary
culture, which makes this hugely attractive," Mergel said
yesterday.
"They're really trying to rethink the relevance of contemporary
art."

The MFA's bigger commitment to contemporary art comes three
years after the
ICA left its cramped building on Boylston Street in the Back Bay
for a new
and dramatic 65,000 square foot space on the waterfront. During
that time,
the ICA established its sensibility through exhibits of Shepard
Fairey,
Tara Donovan, and Anish Kapoor. It's not clear what shape the MFA's
contemporary programming will take in its new space, but Mergel's
work
across town should offer a clue.

At the ICA, Mergel was hired as a curatorial assistant in 2005.
She
cocurated a blockbuster survey of work by the sculptor Donovan and
organized the provocative exhibit "Acting Out: Social Experiments
in
Video." Mergel also curated several of the ICA's Momentum
exhibits, which
highlight up-and-coming artists. She became assistant curator in
2007 and
was promoted to associate curator last year.

The MFA's previous curator of contemporary art, Cheryl Brutvan,
left that
position in the summer of 2008 after a decade. Mergel did not apply
for the
post; the museum called her last summer after identifying her as a
suitable
candidate, one of 70 considered by its search committee. Eight
finalists
were interviewed.

The appointment caught the ICA unawares. "I was surprised,"
ICA director
Jill Medvedow said, recalling her reaction after Mergel told her
she had
been offered and decided to take the MFA job. "I had understood
that they
had done a broad search, and it caught me off guard."

But Medvedow conceded that "young curators move and are
building their
careers," and said the MFA's decision was "a compliment, both to
Jen and
the ICA."

MFA director Malcolm Rogers said that he enjoyed the Donovan
exhibit, which
drew critical praise and attracted 69,590 visitors to the ICA. He
was also
impressed by Mergel's personality. "The thing that comes across
when you
first meet her is her enthusiasm, intelligence, and she's highly
articulate," said Rogers. "Critical for the museum is to have
someone who
is a great curator with a vision, but also someone who is a great
people
person, who can win support for the museum."

The MFA's ambitious Art of the Americas Wing will open next
November. The
West Wing is scheduled to become the museum's center for
contemporary art
in June 2011. Rogers said in a statement that Mergel's appointment
as
senior curator of contemporary art will help the MFA "expand the
presence
of contemporary art at the museum with new galleries, exhibitions,
installations, and educational programs."

Before starting at the ICA, Mergel was a curatorial fellow at
the Addison
Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy. She graduated from
Harvard
University with a degree in visual and environmental studies and
earned her
graduate degree at the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard
College.

The ICA will leave Mergel's post open for now, as it is more
focused on
replacing chief curator Nicholas Baume, who left in September to
serve as
director of the Public Art Fund in New York City. The ICA is
expected to
name its chief curator early next year, Medvedow said.

Mergel emphasized that she has been happy at the ICA and was not
looking
to leave. But she found the MFA's commitment to contemporary work
compelling, and by looking more closely at the MFA's collection,
she said
she'd made exciting discoveries within its contemporary holdings,
the
majority of which remain in storage because of space constraints in
the
building.

"Jen really shared our excitement, not just directed at the
expansion of
the contemporary arts presence at the museum, but to quite
literally
reexamine what contemporary art could be at an encyclopedic
museum," said
Edward Saywell, the MFA's chair of the department of contemporary
art and
programs, a position that includes oversight of the museum's film
and music
programming.

"In some respects, it's ironic that we ended up in our own
backyard, so to
speak. But the bottom line is that a search committee found the
very best
candidate we possibly could. In the end, she was in our backyard."
