Glamour and hype will dominate the mood on Sunday night when the
Giants visit the Dallas Cowboys before what could be an NFL record
crowd of more than 100,000 fans in the first regular-season game in
their new $1.15 billion stadium in Arlington, Texas.

Not only will it be a road game against a division rival in the
National Football Conference East for the Giants, it also will be
the first of three consecutive games away from home.

In the bigger scope, four of the Giants' next five games, and
five of the next seven, are on the road. Perhaps it is too early to
suggest that this lopsided itinerary makes for a critical juncture
in their season, but it will be a challenge.

"Obviously, you would like to have a nice balance," coach Tom
Coughlin said of the schedule. "But we have had some success on
the road before."

Barry Cofield, a defensive tackle, said the Giants were "not
too worried about" the stretch of away games. "We've got the
veteran leadership and experience playing on the road," he said.

Last season, the Giants were 5-3 in away games. The season
before, when they won the Super Bowl, they swept four consecutive
playoff games away from Giants Stadium. With all the hoopla in
Texas over Sunday night's nationally televised game, the Cowboys
(1-0) could be more distracted.

Most of the Giants seemed excited about playing in a building
with about 80,000 seats and space for at least 20,000 more in
standing-room sections. The crowd could challenge the NFL
attendance record that was set at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City,
where 103,467 fans saw San Francisco play Arizona on Oct. 2, 2005.

But not everyone is a Dallas fan. Earlier in the week, Giants
running back Brandon Jacobs discussed his feelings toward America's
Team.

"The reason I hate the Cowboys so much is because they have so
many fans," Jacobs said. "Everywhere you go, someone is always
saying: 'Big D! Go, Big D!' I don't want to hear that. That's what
makes me hate."

On offense, the Giants were hoping to improve upon last season's
trip to the old stadium when they lost, 20-8, and quarterback Eli
Manning was sacked eight times.

In that game, tackle Kareem McKenzie left early with an injury
and guard Rich Seubert became ill. But Manning said the big problem
was, "We were in a lot of third-and-long positions where you've
got to hold the ball a little bit."

Center Shaun O'Hara said it was "a rough game for all of us"
and that the key to this one would be "start fast and take the
crowd out of it and make sure we don't turn into a one-dimensional
team" that has to pass.

"Run the ball effectively and early so we can stay balanced,"
O'Hara said. "You always want to stay out of third-and-long, but
especially on the road. That makes it hard. It kind of plays into
their hands."

The responsibility for that will go not only to the blockers but
also to Jacobs, who gained only 46 yards on 16 carries during a
23-17 victory over Washington last Sunday. Though the Giants won,
they had trouble putting the football in the end zone, settling for
three field goals. On a fourth-and-1 at the Redskins 3 at the start
of the second quarter, they missed out altogether when Jacobs was
stopped and the Giants turned the ball over on downs.

Ramses Barden, a rookie receiver drafted in the third round,
could play in place of Hakeem Nicks, the first-round draft choice
who is out with a sprained foot. The 6-foot-6 Barden could help in
the red zone, where the ability to elevate becomes more important
because room to maneuver is limited.

Early last week Manning said, "We have to throw the ball a
little bit more possibly in some of those situations."

At least the offense is healthier than the defense.

Cofield said he was concerned with a calf injury that will
sideline Chris Canty, a fellow tackle and a former Cowboy. Jay
Alford, another defensive tackle, is out for the season after knee
surgery.

"We've still got three good tackles left," Cofield said. "But
we probably won't have the kind of rotation we expected. Hopefully,
it's not too hot down there. Thank goodness it's a night game."

Cofield, Fred Robbins and Rocky Bernard make up a three-man
rotation for the two tackle positions in the Giants' 4-3 defense,
although defensive end Justin Tuck also lines up inside on some
passing downs.

And the line is not the most damaged unit of the defense. In
Friday's final practice, the Giants used only five defensive backs.
Cornerback Aaron Ross is still out with a hamstring injury.

Listed as questionable and idle Friday were safety Kenny
Phillips with a left knee injury and cornerback Kevin Dockery with
a hamstring. Another injury during the game could force a wide
receiver to line up on defense.

And once the game is going, the Giants will have an opportunity
to watch the already infamous scoreboard over the field that could
obstruct punts while giving fans a big-screen view of the
proceedings.

"I watch a lot of TV," defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka said.
"So for me to go out there and watch an 80-yard Jumbotron, that's
going to be impressive."
