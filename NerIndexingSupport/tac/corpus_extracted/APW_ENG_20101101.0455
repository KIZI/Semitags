Oprah Winfrey's new cable TV network is planning new series on two pairs of entertainers with complicated lives: country music stars the Judds and actor Ryan O'Neal and his daughter, Tatum.

The OWN network says both shows will appear sometime next year, along with a new makeover show starring Carson Kressley of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."

OWN will flicker to life at noon on New Year's Day with Winfrey explaining in an hour-long special what her network is going to be about.

The long-estranged O'Neals attempt a reconciliation in their series.

In "The Judds," mom Naomi and daughter Wynonna prepare for their first tour together in a decade. OWN says the Judds "continue to explore their complex relationship."
