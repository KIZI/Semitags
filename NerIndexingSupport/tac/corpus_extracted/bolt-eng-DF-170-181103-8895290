 NBC/WSJ poll: Cain now leads GOP pack - politics - Decision 2012 - msnbc.com 

I didn't think he would rise this quickly.

Cain is now a force and will be attacked from all sides both left and right.
 
 
Cain checks in as the first choice of 27 percent of Republican voters in the poll, followed by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney at 23 percent and Perry at 16 percent. After those three, it’s Texas Rep. Ron Paul at 11 percent, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at 8 percent, Bachmann at 5 percent and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman at 3 percent.
 
 
Just a couple weeks ago the left on this board proclaimed Cain DOA for taking a couple days off to promote his new book. I countered saying its just what he needed to push himself into the public. Now look at him.

Seems the left is a bit out of touch with the public.
 
 
 
He is just the Main Stream Media's flavor of the month.

 

Are you implying that the media is promoting a fraudulent poll?

Seems to me Cain is the peoples flavor.
 
 
 
In July/Early August it was Bachmann after she won the Iowa poll. Then Perry got in the race and he was the media darling until he stuff about him being an incompetent moron and his family's nigger head bs came out then it was Romney to a smaller extent and now its Cain. The only one that won't be their flavor of the month is Ron Paul the only damn person that will keep us out of more wars,reduce the debt,audit the fed and close the border! They don't like him because he rocks the boat to much for the neo con's.

 

And there in lies the truth. You discredit the poll because it isn't Paul.

crap you beat me to it....igonre my thread  
 
 
I'm not sure I'm gonna throw my support or money at Cain yet but I am very excited at the prospect of forcing new ideas on the old wind bags.

So boys....

Whose bandwagon will you be riding next week?
 
 
Cain had better enjoy this while it lasts... cause it won't.

Looking at the present in no way indicates a concrete future rightwinger, and I don't like to ignore the present facts. So, this is actually happening right now.

It's rather like having a head in sand to not see that.

He might well get a fine Cabinet position.
 
 
Imagine that. The only TRUE conservative leads the pack!

I love Herman Cain and right now he is the hot item, but it won't last, and he won't win the nomination. Once people dig a little further into his 9-9-9 plan they won't like it, especially New Hamshire a 1st in the primary states that has no sales tax and does not want one either.

I like Herman, and if it comes down to him and the Weird Mormon Robot, I'll vote for him.

That said, Cain is just benefiting from being the latest "Not Romney" out there.

We've spent the last year looking for "not Romney". Huckabee, Trump, Palin, Daniels, Christie, Perry, Bachmann and now Herman Cain. What is clear is that the GOP rank and file doesn't want anything to do with Romney.

Maybe it needs to get a restraining order against him. His behavior is about one step from stalking.
 
 
Very surprising. I like Cain. Besides Ron Paul,he's the only one i feel is genuine and not just another phony career politician. Maybe other people are feeling the same as me about him. The guy does come off as being very honest and up front. And the guy knows business too. He's probably exactly what this country needs at this point. I'm rooting for him.

He has my support and i'm sure i'd do some volunteer work if he had a snowballs chance to win my state (but i live in MA and obama will take this state).

However I will NEVER EVER EVER donate to a politicians campaign.
 
 
its all a sham....we gets da blackies on our sidz wit dis guy and obama no win....

You mean bringing up that Cain has an unjustified hatred and mistrust of Muslims does not contribute to the thread?

I don't think Cain hates muslims at all but he does have an issue with those muslims who might be seeking to institute sharia law in the United States. He feels its pervasive enough of an issue to warrant extra screening for any muslim he may hire into his administration to make sure they will put the country's laws before the laws of Islam.

I'm not saying I agree with that but I want to at least let you see an accurate portryal of his position.

Does anyone really think Sharia law could be passed in this country and we need Cain to protect us?

What a nutjob

I would hope it couldn't. However, maybe with the right (or wrong) people in powerful positions groundwork could be laid to ease it into our society.....you know sorta like the progressive movement over the last 80 years or so  .
