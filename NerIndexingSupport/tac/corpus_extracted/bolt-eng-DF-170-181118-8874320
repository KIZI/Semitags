On November 10, 1775, America's 911 service, our glorious USMC were born.

When It Absolutely, Positively Must Be DESTROYED Overnight -- Call The USMC

"And On The Seventh Day When GOD Rested,
We Overran His Perimeter And Stole The Globe,
We Stole The Eagle From The Air Force,
The Anchor From The Navy,
The Rope From The Army,
And Have Been Protecting Our Shores Ever Since."

Semper Fi!

Said a Vet from Nineteen forty-five,
"Men were dying by the score."
An eyewitness to a famous Battle
Immortalized forever more.
Quartermaster on a LST
"Eyewitness to a sad, horrible day."
"A slaughter right there on the Beach"
Is what, this Veteran had to say.
Coast Guardsman Robert Resnick
Was more than just a witness there
He furnished the Stars and Stripes
In that picture all generations share.
A symbol for the Marine Corps
Cast in bronze for all to see
The Flag raised on that mountain top
Is part of our Nation’s History.
One of the bloodiest Battles of the War
Fought for thirty-six days and nights
More than twenty two thousand Japanese
In one of the Marines fiercest fights.
The first part of Japan we invaded
And as Resnick’s ship sat on the beach
Marine Gagnon asked him for a Flag
And a long pipe to raise it’s reach.
They lost their sight of the Marine
As he headed to that Mountain top
Amidst the gun’s bullets flying
That never, ever seemed to stop.
As they began to leave the Beach
A tremendous cheer went all around
And, "Every ship tooted it’s horn."
As they raised the Flag that he had found.
For years another was credited
Until the year, Two thousand-one
When at a Fifth Marine Convention
The Marines learned he really was the one.
A big, old Marine bellowed out,
"Do you really mean to tell me,
That you never realized that you
Won that Battle, single-handedly?"
The President of the Fifth Marines
Made him an honorary member
And as they did some tears were shed
As they all began to remember
About that day sixty years ago
Up there on Mount Surabachi
When the Stars and Stripes were raised high
Was still a vivid, cherished, memory.

The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to

PRIVATE FIRST CLASS WILLIAM R. CADDY
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Rifleman with Company I, Third Battalion, Twenty-sixth Marines, Fifth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the seizure of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 3 March 1945. Consistently aggressive, Private First Class Caddy boldly defied shattering Japanese machine-gun and small-arms fire to move forward with his platoon leader and another Marine during a determined advance of his company through an isolated sector and, gaining the comparative safety of a shell hole, took temporary cover with his comrades. Immediately pinned down by deadly sniper fire from a well-concealed position, he made several unsuccessful attempts to again move forward and then, joined by his platoon leader, engaged the enemy in a fierce exchange of hand grenades until a Japanese grenade fell in the shell hole. Fearlessly disregarding all personal danger, Private First Class Caddy instantly threw himself upon the deadly missile, absorbing the exploding charge in his own body and protecting the others from serious injury. Stouthearted and indomitable, he unhesitatingly yielded his own life that his fellow Marines might carry on the relentless battle against a fanatic enemy. His dauntless courage and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of certain death reflects the highest credit upon Private First Class Caddy and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.[4]

/S/ HARRY S TRUMAN

PFC Caddy was nineteen years old.

"By their victory, the 3rd, 4th and 5th Marine Divisions and other units of the Fifth Amphibious Corps have made an accounting to their country which only history will be able to value fully. Among the Americans serving on Iwo island, uncommon valor was a common virtue."- Adm. Chester W. Nimitz

Happy Birthday!!!! I will forever be in your debt...  

"The man who will go where his colors will go, without asking, who will fight a phantom foe in a jungle and mountain range, without counting, and who will suffer and die in the midst of incredible hardship, without complaint, is still what he has always been, from Imperial Rome to sceptered Britain to Democratic America. He is the stuff of which legions are made. His pride is his colors and his regiment, his training hard and thorough and coldly realistic, to fit him for what he must face, and his obedience is to his orders. As a legionary, he held the gates of civilization for the classical world... he has been called United States Marine.

Oh, okay, I'll play along:

"Military service is so honorably badass that the beautiful and powerful are clamoring to be on the arm of any Private Snuffy simply to pay tribute to their service. The stars are virtually beating a path to the barracks in search of a date. I don't know why I didn't ask Scarlett Johansson to one of my balls. I am sure she would have said yes, and even my wife wouldn't have faulted me for that move!"

But back in the real world: The guy scored a date with one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. She could have easily blown him off with some glib statement or signed picture or feigned excuse, but instead she is going with him.

That's a classy move on her part and "Scotty" is a lucky SOB.

"Fortune favors the bold."

She should consider herself honored to be escorted by a Marine.

If you can't say anything nice...........

You would have bitched if he turned down the date, and you bitch about him, not only showing up, but taking the time to write about what a moving experience it was.

Like you would have turned down a date with Timberlake when you were a Marine.

Happy Birthday, Marines!

From your older brothers-U. S. Army, est. 14 June, 1775  
 
 
There was one story notable out of the many that came out of the battle for Pelieliu, during WWII.
The twelve thousand five hundred defenders of the island that faced the Marine landing forces were seasoned previous veterans of the Manchurian campaign. They had been told not to fear the invading soldiers, the soft children of Democracy, for they were sure to tuck tail and run once they met the indomitable will of the Soldiers of The Empire Of Japan.One member of the Japanese beach defenders, later captured, remarked that the first time he had ever felt fear was while watching one Marine wading through the waters toward him, firing his weapon with one hand as he approached, while dragging the body of his dead comrade behind him through the surf.

Us Marines on Tarawa, November, 1943: This may appear somewhat strange with so many Marines standing around this mound, but it supposedly was the last major fortified Japanese position left on the island and the Marines were just eliminating the last of the ants in the anthill.

I was never a Marine. Many of my closest friends are though.... and I'd date a Marine over Timberlake every day of the week.

I'm not dissing JT, I am happy that he honored his word... I'm just saying that, in my view, he was the lucky one.
 
 
Happy birthday, Leatherheads!

I know. I was being facetious. Celebrities are generally well received by military personnel. Anyone who takes the time to show some appreciation is okay in my book. When I was in Afghanistan, Vince Vaughn went out to Salerno (about as far forward as they'd let a celebrity go) and pinned some E-5's stripes on him. I don't agree with his politics, but I respect the hell out of him for doing that.

Maybe you were being silly, but I doubt Timberlake was anything but well received. Of course, it's hard to give liberal Hollywood any credit, isn't it?

words have meanings  
 
 
My son works out with some of the group that was with Kelsey and Justin at the ball. They are reporting that he was truly humbled and for real, had a good time, just like he blogged.

Also, Kelsey is a Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP) instructor. She is known here in the Quantico area as a bad ass.

Okay.

 

Generally, I have very little respect for 'celebrities'... regardless of their political persuasion... but trust you to think it's relevant.

I'd rather date a decent Marine than JT... or any other 'celebrity'.
