 
 
Scandals Rock the Obama White house Media remains silent
 
 
You remember Abu Ghraib where pictures supposedly showed prisoner abuse. You remember Guantanamo Bay prison where prisoners of war were being held during the active war (the war is still ongoing) they were engaged in before capture. You recall the Patriot Act where certain ones among us went nuts because they claimed Bush was violating Constitutional guarantees of privacy.

Well the Baghdad Central Prison formerly known as Abu Ghraib is still open, Guantanamo Bay Prison is still open and the Patriot Act is still functioning. These were all supposedly scandals under the Bush administration so what has changed. Read more...  Creating Orwellian Worldview 
 
 
Um...the left has a technical reason. That was then and this is now.
 
 
President Barry Hussein Soetoro ?
 
 
The media is a obamaturd socialist butt kissing entity, they will not smear his already lack luster character.
 
 
Bullshit.

the media is corporate.

Guantanamo Bay Prison doesnt make me very happy.

I wish to hell it would be closed.

I bet the major reason it is not is to protect the last admin.

The decision to NOT prosicute the past admin was a bad one.

You cant close this prison without opening up massive flood of legal action against the Bush admin officials.

It sucks ass.

It is completely unfair to hold the left to their words. Actually expecting them to mean what they say.

They even had a senator state he should not be held to account for his words. The lefties cheered, and that was that.

Where's your evidence that the Bush administration violated the law?

Oh that's right you don't have any!

TM is nothing more than a cowardly Obama mouthpiece.
 
 
Why does it not close like Obama said it would?

Why keep it open?

Does what you just wrote make ANY sense to you at all, hon? You think that the Obama Administration hasn't closed Gitmo because they want to "protect" the Bush Administration? The very same Administration that they've been blaming for everything but the common cold for the past three years? I hate to say this...but you're getting even more delusional as the weeks fly by.

Which is bullshit. Because Bush has been to Europe several times since leaving office. He's has been to meet the Queen, privately, at least twice. How embarrassing that you prefer fiction to fact.

Idiot.

Why keep it open?

 

Pssssst....hey, Truth? You may not have noticed...but "candidate" Obama promised lots of things. That's the EASY part. It's the whole...keeping your promise" thing that he has problems with.

Gitmo hasn't closed because it serves a very real purpose...something "President" Obama has reluctantly had to admit.

I'm afraid she's too far gone to follow along.

Had they had the goods they most certainly would have tried to impeach, but instead all they ever did was talk about it, threaten, etc. And ditto for indicting and prosecuting afterwards. All of it was just feeding their base of idiots what they wanted to hear, and offering 'em all a nice glass of Kool-Aid to wash it down. Dimwits...absolute dimwits.

Yep.
 
 
Yep is right.

Gitmos is the perfect place to keep the dirtbags.

No one wants them on American soil. In fact I think Congress went so far as to ban them being held in America.

As for prosecuting Bush, for what??

Going to war?? Hell. Barry is fighting the very same Congressionally approved wars and we have a hand in Libya to boot. (Without Congressional approval BTW)

Barry is also using what Bush left in place. Guess he needs to be impeached or arrested as well.

Oh wait. I forgot. He's a Dem. As far as TDM is concerned he's just perfect.

Very true.

But it is far more devious than that....

The Old Left Media doesn't merely ignore the scandals...it creates more smoke and mirrors than a fire in a brothel...

...does anyone not think that the huge coverage of the Pee Party, the OWS is anything other than an obfuscation??

It's a tactic to hide the scandals and the ineptitude of the Obama administration.

Nothing more than obamaturd lied as usual. Bush was right. Only socialists think otherwise.

Idiot.

 

Really? Since leaving office? He may have met the Queen "privately" and he traveled to places like Brazil and China but not Europe and be exposed to those possibilities.

Why are you saying idiotic things??

According to what you said the Obama administratin is protecting the Bush Administration for all of its so called wrong doings.

The same so called wrong doings the current administration is continuing.

Gitmo is open because its the perfect place for the dirtbags. The dirtbags that no one wants on American soil. Barry found out saying he's going to close Gitmo is a hell of a lot easier than closing Gitmo. Reality sure does pop you in the chops on occasion.

What pray tell do you think the Bush administration should be prosecuted for??

I'll wait.
