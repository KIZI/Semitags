 
 
If you disbelieve in God, you are fighting Islam and must be fought
 
 
Some Muslims quote the verse below to make it seem like Islam is a fair and peaceful religion which fights only in self defence:

 
Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.
Quran 2:190
 

To summarise this thread, most of the famous muffasirun (Quran scholars) such as al-Suyuti and Ibn Kathir mention that most scholars ruled that this verse was abrogated and no longer applies because Muhammad fought people who didnt fight him. However those who think the verse still applies, only think that because they believe disbelieving in Allah=fighting Muslims :

For example:
Spoiler:
When Muhammad ordered the demolition of Dhul Khalasa and killed 300 people, did those people fight Muhammad? No.

 
In the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance there was a house called Dhu-l-Khalasa or Al-Ka'ba Al-Yamaniya or Al-Ka'ba Ash-Shamiya. The Prophet said to me, "Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l-Khalasa?" So I set out with one-hundred-and-fifty riders, and we dismantled it and killed whoever was present there. Then I came to the Prophet and informed him, and he invoked good upon us and Al-Ahmas (tribe).
Sahih al-Bukhari, 5: 59:641
 

When Muhammad attacked the Banu Mustaliq did the banu Mustaliq fight Muhammad. What does the hadith say:

 
The Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water. Their fighting men were killed and their women and children were taken as captives"
Sahih Bukhari 3: 46:717
 

An al-Azhar university scholar said about offensive fighting:

 
It is meaningless to talk about the holy war as only defensive, otherwise, what did the prophet mean when he said, "from now on even if they don’t invade you, you must invade them (p 242)"
[Dr. M. Sa’id Ramadan Al-Buti - "Jurisprudence of Muhammad’s Biography", pg. 242]
 

By the way, the hadith (quote/actions of Muhammad) the cleric is referring to is this:

 
"On the day of Al-Ahzab (i.e. clans) the Prophet said, (After this battle) we will go to attack them (i.e. the infidels) and they will not come to attack us."
[Sahih Bukhari, 5: 59:435]
 

According to Muslim scholar Dr. Hawarey, 80% of the 80+ battles Muhammad ordered were offensive:  http://military.hawarey.org/military_english.htm 
[/QUOTE]

Al suyuti:

 
After the Prophet (s) was prevented from [visiting] the House in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya, he made a pact with the disbelievers that he would be allowed to return the following year, at which time they would vacate Mecca for three days. Having prepared to depart for the Visitation [‘umra], [he and] the believers were concerned that Quraysh would not keep to the agreement and instigate fighting. The Muslims were averse to becoming engaged in fighting while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability in the Sacred Enclosure [al-haram] and during the sacred months, and so the following was revealed: And fight in the way of God, to elevate His religion, with those who fight against you, the disbelievers, but aggress not, against them by initiating the fighting; God loves not the aggressors, the ones that overstep the bounds which God has set for them: this stipulation was abrogated by the verse of barā’a, ‘immunity’ [Q. 9:1], or by His saying below:
Tafsir al jalayn (Suyuti)
 

Ibn Kathir:

 
(And fight in the way of Allah those who fight you,) Abu Al-`Aliyah said, "This was the first Ayah about fighting that was revealed in Al-Madinah. Ever since it was revealed, Allah's Messenger used to fight only those who fought him and avoid non-combatants. Later, Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9 in the Qur'an) was revealed." `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said similarly, then he said that this was later abrogated by the Ayah
Tafsir Ibn Kathir
 

Ibn Kathir mentioned that other scholars believe the verse was abrogated (no longer applies). But he did not believe that. Why? He says that anyone who disbelieves in Allah is fighting Muslims:

 
(The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land.) ` Wage war' mentioned here means, oppose and contradict, and it includes disbelief,
Ibn Kathir
 

 http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/6968/2/ 

Those scholars who dont accept that this verse was abrogated, do that because they think disbelief =fighting muslims. One can conclude that the Islamic definition of non combatant is not the same as the western definition.

For example people like Imam Shaffi (who's school of Islam is followed by 300 million + muslims) considered anyone who refused to pay jizyah (protection money) as a "combatant".

Evidence here:  http://www.currenttrends.org/docLib/...tantsFinal.pdf 

Hence its important to know when Muslims are playing the semantics game, as their definition of "innocent" or "combatant", maybe not be same as yours.

I find it annoying that a lot of Muslims quote that verse without telling us that all the famous Muslim scholar believe it no longer applies, and those who believe it applies. believe it only applies because disbelieving in Allah=fighting Muslims according to them.

They are not being entirely honest !

Had you looked at the entire tafsir of Ibn Kathir for Surah Maidah 5:33-34, you'd find:

1- Muslims are also liable to the same punishment.

2- Repentance is allowed and so the punishment is not as severe.

To conclude, verse 33 does not teach that only non-Muslim should be punished.

Theres no word which translate as "fight" in arabic. However, the word "combat" makes more sense here.

 
Combat in the way of Allah those who combat you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.

The word combat is referring to military combat.

Why was that? Is it because they disbelieved in God, hence they are fighting Muslims?

Fight, combat can be used interchangeably. But the problem lies when Arabic is translated into English as there is no literal meaning of "fight".

But you are correct, lets use the word 'kill' here:

 
Kill in the way of Allah those who kill you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.
Quran 2:190
 

You're telling me, if i came up to you in the street and punched you, you wouldn't fight back?
 
 
if religion didn't exist, hitler wouldn't have killed thousands of jews. if religion didn't exist, no one would be preaching on a student forum.

Conflicting ideas = war.
Religion causes conflict, not peace.

If religion didnt exist, there'd probably be less war but war nevertheless. People go to war for different reasons - empire, religion, power, money, greed etc

You cannot run away from the truth and put forth you twisted lies when you look at the context in which each verse of the Qur'an was revealed. We can only apply the words of the Qur'an in the way Muhammed (pbuh) acted after it was revealed.

Anybody who says that Hadith can abrogate parts of the Qur'an is a LIAR. Hadith does not abrogate Qur'an, but the other way around. It tells us in the Qur'an that if any hadith goes against the words of the Qur'an then we should reject it.

“In which hadith after this will they believe?” (al-A`araaf [7]:185).

“These are God’s revelations we recite to you in truth. Then, in which hadith after God and His revelations will they believe?” (al-Jatheya [45]:6).

“Shall I seek other than God as a source of law and judgment when He is the One who has sent down the Book to you in detail?” (al-An`am [6]:114).

“What is wrong with you? How do you judge? Do you have another book which you study?” (al-Qalam [68]:35-36).

Anybody who tries to abrogate the Qur'an using any other book is a deceiver, whether it be hadith or not.

Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?
Qur'an Text/Transliteration 2:106
 

The meaning of this verse according to ibn kathir

 
The Meaning of Naskh
Ibn Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said that,
(Whatever a verse (revelation) do Nansakh) means, "Whatever an Ayah We abrogate. Also, Ibn Jurayj said that Mujahid said that,
(Whatever a verse (revelation) do Nansakh) means, "Whatever an Ayah We erase. Also, Ibn Abi Najih said that Mujahid said that,
(Whatever a verse (revelation) do Nansakh) means, "We keep the words, but change the meaning. He related these words to the companions of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud. Ibn Abi Hatim said that similar statements were mentioned by Abu Al-`Aliyah and Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. Also As-Suddi said that,
(Whatever a verse (revelation) do Nansakh) means, "We erase it. Further, Ibn Abi Hatim said that it means, "Erase and raise it, such as erasing the following wordings (from the Qur'an), `The married adulterer and the married adulteress: stone them to death,' and, `If the son of Adam had two valleys of gold, he would seek a third.'
Ibn Jarir stated that,
(Whatever a verse (revelation) do Nansakh) means, "Whatever ruling we repeal in an Ayah by making the allowed unlawful and the unlawful allowed. The Nasakh only occurs with commandments, prohibitions, permissions, and so forth. As for stories, they do not undergo Nasakh. The word, `Nasakh' literally means, `to copy a book'. The meaning of Nasakh in the case of commandments is removing the commandment and replacing it by another. And whether the Nasakh involves the wordings, the ruling or both, it is still called Nasakh.
Allah said next,
(or Nunsiha (cause it to be forgotten)). `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said that,
(Whatever a verse (revelation) do Nansakh or Nunsiha) means, "Whatever Ayah We repeal or uphold without change. Also, Mujahid said that the companions of Ibn Mas`ud (who read this word Nansa'ha) said that it means, "We uphold its wording and change its ruling. Further, `Ubayd bin `Umayr, Mujahid and `Ata' said, `Nansa'ha' means, "We delay it (i.e., do not abrogate it). Further, `Atiyyah Al-`Awfi said that the Ayah means, "We delay repealing it. This is the same Tafsir provided by As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. `Abdur-Razzaq said that Ma`mar said that Qatadah said about Allah's statement,
(Whatever a verse (revelation) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten) "Allah made His Prophet forget what He willed and He abrogated what He will.
Allah's said,
(We bring a better one or similar to it), better, relates to the benefit provided for the one it addresses, as reported from `Ali bin Abi Talhah that Ibn `Abbas said,
(We bring a better one) means, "We bring forth a more beneficial ruling, that is also easier for you. Also, As-Suddi said that,
(We bring a better one or similar to it) means, "We bring forth a better Ayah, or similar to that which was repealed. Qatadah also said that,
(We bring a better one or similar to it) means, "We replace it by an Ayah more facilitating, permitting, commanding, or prohibiting.

and according to Muhammad and his companions and muslim scholar. mischief means disbelief in allah

 http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/6333/2/ 

and mischief makers must be killed according to islam.

The above view is further backed up by Sahih Muslim 1:176, which suggests that killing/fighting non muslims is preventing mischief. Killing Muslims deliberately is promoting mischief. Furthermore, according to Sahih Bukhari 9: 83:50, Sahih Bukhari 1: 3:111, and Sahih Bukhari 4: 52:283 "no Muslim should be killed in Qisas (equality in punishment) for killing a Kafiir (disbeliever)", and Sahih Bukhari 1: 8:387, which indicates only muslim life is sacred.

The meaning of this verse according to ibn kathir

 

It just shows how much you lack in the basics of Islam. Please leave this to the grown ups.

When that verse says We (the majestic plural) it is talking about God Himself. NOBODY except God has that power, and ONLY the Qur'an can abrogate the Qur'an.

I advise you to try a bit harder because you are making it too easy. You are falling on the very first hurdles because of your obvious lack of basic Islamic knowledge and common sense.

So you are the one who is wrong. It is so obvious what you are doing though, and many have tried to do it in the past and have failed.
 
 
 
 

Dude, how many of these threads have you started? Get a life..let me rephrase that...get a job
 
 
 
 
 
The funny thing is, you really believed you had a point there. Must be disheartening watching it fall apart so quickly, and to add insult to injury, it was the verse you provided in its entirety which wiped out your false claims.  
 
 
 
Religion of peace my ass.

 

because judaism is soo much better :P
 
 
Come at me bro
 
 
 
Religion of peace my ass.

 

Your from Israel...Your statement is hypocritical on so many levels!!
 
 
If that is so.. then what does the Qur'an mean when it says " There's no compulsion in the religion " and also says in Sura al nas " You have your religion and we Muslims have ours " ?

Also it says in 10:99 " [O Muhammad], would you compel the people in order that they become believers ?! "

Interesting isn't it ?

Then there would be no point of Jizya then. Clearly something does not make sense here and if you look at historical sources, there are many references alluding to Muslim empires tolerating Christians and Jews in comparison to Christian Europe!

Case in point:
…[But] by the standards then prevailing–and they are plainly the only ones by which a historian is entitled to pass judgment–Spanish Islamic tolerance was no myth but a reality of which present-day Muslim Arabs are fully justified in reminding their contemporaries…Tolerance, then, is a highly relative concept, and the only sensible way of gauging the extent of tolerance in a given society or culture in a given age is to compare it with that prevailing in other societies and cultures in the same period…

The only plausible conclusion one could draw from the whole debate is that, while Jewish life in Muslim Spain–and under Islam generally–was not exactly the idyllic paradise some would want us to believe, it was far from the veritable hell that was the Jews’ consistent lot under Christendom.

  Have a look at your posts:

It has been pointed out that the pact of Umar is dishonest by your own source along with a spelling mistake of another one. In addition, you use an ‘abridged’ tafsir of Ibn Kathir to why you misled that no treaty existed in the Battle of Trench  [1]  which when fully shown appeared to the contrary.  [2]  You then refute your own point by saying it’s “not a primary source”  [3] , yet you call another user, a ‘fringe Muslim’ for choosing to ignore the importance of scholarly interpretation of the Qur’an.  [4]  Also, you ironically continue to use supposed Ibn Kathir tafsirs to try to depict the peaceful verses as abrogated.  [5] 

Furthermore, you state that on this thread  [6]  that “60% of which are based on authentic sources”. How did you calculate that? You presented only two choices, yes and no, for the reliability Ibn Ishaq’s story about Battle of the Trench  [7] , however, why isn’t this considered the same case for WikiIslam? And you “agree with most things that page said” of the Islamic-replies link I posted (post #10), including the part where another example of Ibn Kathir’s tafsir is shown to be half-cut from WikiIslam, which when fully shown, it leaves their lack of credibility exposed.

Amid the many examples of inconsistencies, it’s also that the wealth of knowledge you have of Islam is not well-rounded especially on D&D ask about Islam. Why should I trust you?

This is not debate where I must check your sources.
 
 
 
Why does everybody forget this? - CHRISTIANITY AND ALL OF THE ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS SPECIFICALLY SAY THAT NON-BELIEVERS ARE ETERNAL ENEMIES.

Jesus, I feel like I'm going crazy here, MOST religions are anti-atheist with explicit references saying that people should be killed if they can't be converted.

 

So all three of them are brutal, hate-filled religions? How does that make Islam any less of a brutal, hate-filled religion?

The fact that other idiologies are equally as violent, does not change the fact that the ideology in question is violent.

 
Your from Israel...Your statement is hypocritical on so many levels!!

 

So everyone who was born/raised in Israel is must follow judaism?

If violence means in self defence then you have no choice. I don't think they're saying that Islam is unnecessarily violent, only that the others are hypocrites with an agenda.
 
 
Yes, everything about this is very vague, with interpretations here and there... And that's just the problem. Interpreting a potential ethical directive to kill, no matter how "complex" or contextual, is incredibly vile and should have no part in modern society.

dude, even authentic hadith mention that quran verses have been abrogated. you can choose to ignore all that if it makes you happy.

now it seems you accept abrogation, before you rejected it. now you at least accept it but claim only god can decide. when muhammad himself decided what was and wasnt abrogated

Yes very interesting.
Regarding the compulsion verse:

IslamQA says verse has been abrogated, see end:  islamqa.com/en/ref/34770 

But according to most famous Tafsir's (books which give the context or meaning of a quran verse), say that this verse has been abrogated and nullified, and no longer applies.

The most famous Tafsir scholar is Ibn Kathir, who said about this verse in his tafsir:

 
"There is no compulsion in religion", meaning: do not force anyone to embrace Islam, because it is clear and its proofs and evidences are manifest. Whoever Allah guides and opens his heart to Islam has indeed embraced it with clear evidence. Whoever Allah misguides blinds his heart and has set a seal on his hearing and a covering on his eyes cannot embrace Islam by force...hence Allah revealed this verse. But, this verse is abrogated by the verse of "fighting".

<You shall be called to fight against a people given to great warfare, then you shall fight them, or they shall surrender" (Al-Fath: 16). Allah also says: <O Prophet! Strive hard against the disbelieves and the hypocrites, and be harsh against them> (At-Tauba:73), and He says: <O you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to you, and let them find harshness in you, and know that Allah is with those who are the Al-Muttaqin (the pious)>, (At-Tauba:123).

Therefore, all people of the world should be called to Islam. If anyone of them refuses to do so, or refuses to pay the Jizya they should be fought till they are killed. This is the meaning of compulsion. In the Sahih, the Prophet said: "Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains", meaning prisoners brought in chains to the Islamic state, then they embrace Islam sincerely and become righteous, and are entered among the people of Paradise
[Tafsir ibn Kathir]
 

Note also that the part where Ibn kathir says the verse was abrogated was conveniently left out in the translation of the book Tafsir ibn Kathir by Saifur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri, who;s translation i the most famous.

Proof abrogation happens in quran:  http://bit.ly/rXOZ1Q 

Also according to Tafsir ibn Abbas:

 
But then Allah's saying (There is no compulsion in religion…) was abrogated and the Prophet was commanded to fight the people of the Book in Surah Repentance.
[Tafsir ibn Abbas]
 

Source (click on english version):  http://altafsir.com/AsbabAlnuzol.asp...arch=yes&img=A 

Ibn Abbas was Muhammad's companion and cousin (and was there when these quran verses were supposedly "revealed" to him by God).

They also usually scream about a context of a verse. Well this verse is related to jews who wanted to have their children converted to judaism and not islam:

 
When the children of a woman (in pre-Islamic days) did not survive, she took a vow on herself that if her child survives, she would convert it a Jew. When Banu an-Nadir were expelled (from Arabia), there were some children of the Ansar (Helpers) among them. They said: We shall not leave our children. So Allah the Exalted revealed; "Let there be no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clear from error."
Abu Dawud 14:2676
 

So, shouldn't Muslims who speak contextually interpret this as applying to Jews who want to force their children to convert to Judaism? Only.

However, this point is irrelevant, given the evidence above, that the verse was abrogated.

 
Mujahid said, "This was before the Apostle of God was commanded to fight against the People of the Book. God’s saying, ‘There is no compulsion in religion’ was abrogated and he was commanded to fight against the People of the Book in Surat Bara‘ah" (Q. 9:29). (Wahidi, pp. 77-78).

According to other traditions, the verse was revealed in reference to the People of the Book, who should not be compelled to enter Islam so long as they pay jizyah (poll tax). The verse is, therefore, not abrogated. Tabari relates on the authority of Qatadah, "Arab society was compelled to enter Islam because they were an unlettered community [ummah ummiyah], having no book which they knew. Thus nothing other than Islam was accepted from them.

The Qur’an and it Interpreters, Mahmoud M. Ayoub, SUNY Press, 1984, Volume I, pp. 253-254
 

You either believe it was abrogated, or you believe Islam forces non-Muslims to pay Jizyah tax.

Mujahid ibn Jabar (who was quoted above) is considered very authentic. He was a Tabi'un (and student of Ibn Abbas; a paternal cousin of Muhammad). Being a companion of Muhammad, Ibn Abbas was present around the time these verses were revealed. Together with Mujahid ibn Jabr, he went through the Qur'an thirty times and memorised the meanings. Muslim scholars consider Mujahid ibn Jabr to have the highest reliability.

This was before the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was commanded to fight the people of the Book. But then Allah's saying (There is no compulsion in religion…) was abrogated and the Prophet was commanded to fight the people of the Book in Surah Repentance”.

Regarding the verse "to be my way, to be your way"

 
There was a time in Makkah when although a storm of opposition had arisen in the pagan society of Quraish against the message of Islam preached by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), yet the Quraish chiefs hall not yet lost hope that they would reach some sort of a compromise with hi m. Therefore, from time to time they would visit him with different proposals of compromise so that he accepted one of them and the dispute between them was brought to an end.
...
If the Surah is read with this background in mind, one finds that it was not revealed to preach religious tolerance as some people of today seem to think, but it was revealed in order to exonerate the Muslims from the disbelievers religion, their rites of worship, and their gods, and to express their total disgust and unconcern with them and to tell them that Islam and kufr (unbelief) had nothing in common and there was no possibility of their being combined and mixed into one entity. Although it was addressed in the beginning to the disbelieving Quraish in response to their proposals of compromise, yet it is not confined to them only, but having made it a part of the Quran, Allah gave the Muslims the eternal teaching that they should exonerate themselves by word and deed from the creed of kufr wherever and in whatever form it be, and should declare without any reservation that they cannot make any compromise with the disbelievers in the matter of Faith. That is why this Surah continued to be recited when the people to whom it was addressed as a rejoinder, had died and been forgotten, and those Muslims also continued to recite it who were disbelievers at the time it was revealed, and the Muslims still recite it centuries after they have passed away, for expression of disgust with and dissociation from kufr and its rites is a perpetual demand of Faith.

How do you respond to this?

The kafir wanted peace with Muhammad so badly, its he was making peace difficult with his conditions of paying jizyah, destroying idols, and forcing others to stop worshipping idols?
 
 
 
dude, even authentic hadith mention that quran verses have been abrogated. you can choose to ignore all that if it makes you happy.

now it seems you accept abrogation, before you rejected it. now you at least accept it but claim only god can decide. when muhammad himself decided what was and wasnt abrogated

 

How convenient of you to give me a reply without a point, but random mumbo-jumbo.

You said that Hadith/Sunnah can abrogate the ( only ) words of God, the Qur'an. You gave me the following verse as proof...

"Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?
Qur'an Text/Transliteration 2:106"

When this clearly indicates that only God has the power to do this, and the only words which have come directly from God are in the Qur'an. No other book has any authority over it.

Also regarding your deceptive blog, you wrote:

"Second, the mutual abrogability of the Qur'an and the Sunna (i) is rationally possible - since the Qur'an describes the Sunna as revealed as well: "Nor does he speak of his own desire" (53:3) "

This is blatant deception on your part, by taking a tiny snippet of the Qur'an and translating it to fit your agenda.

 
The Qur’an has differentiated between the ordinary human speech of Nabi (S.A.W) and the "wahi" or revelation sent to him, and has clarified that it is only the Qur’an that is revealed on him, and all that he uttered in life was not revelation but only the Qur’an was the inspired revelation from God. The following is evidence from the Qur’an to this effect.

Above is a link proving the deception you have tried to convey in your mission to spread lies about the Qur'an. Can I ask you if you're being paid?

Once a liar, always a liar. Your intentions are as clear as the hand that I hold in front of my face, and anybody taking your words as truth only have their gullibility to blame.

Good day

i dont get what your saying. what did i lie about

am not sure what your accusing me of lying about this time.
 
 
 
your not being clever. my exact arguements are reffering to jizyag, that muhammad fought people who didnt even fight him to force them to pay jizyah

 

2nd class has covered this pretty well and in addition here’s a stern warning for us Muslims:

Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I would definitely fight against him who severed prayer from Zakat, for it is the obligation upon the rich.
Muslim :: Book 1 : Hadith 29 (an excerpt).
 Complete hadith here. 

Abu Bakr fought against the Muslims who didn't pay Zakat. So how does this discriminate against the Christians and Jews?

Inb4, your strawman that "zakah doesn't benefit Non-Muslims so that must mean Muslims were all genocidal 11211!!11!!!"
 
 
To understand what these "abrogations" mean read the following article.

 http://nicheoftruth.org/pages/the_qu...abrogation.htm

That's right, act clueless when you know you are wrong. I made it clear what you claimed, and their errors, but if you have difficulties in reading you might want to take your own advice and get back to your "revision".
 
 
christ, i hate religion

Yes, even Muhammad attacked Muslims who refused to pay Zakat and took their women and children captive according to the Muslim scholar Saifur Rahman al Mubarakpuri:

 
Therefore, ‘Uyaina bin Hisn set out to fight them. All the way long he marched by night and lurked by day. He went on that way till he overtook them and attacked them in the desert. They fled back for their lives. Eleven men, twenty-one women and thirty boys were captured then. He drove them back to Madinah and were housed in Ramlah bint Al-Harith’s residence. Ten of their leaders, who came to the Prophet’s door, called out unto him saying: "O Muhammad come out and face us." When he went out they held him and started talking.
 Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 269 
 

Are you suggesting that Zakat and Jizyah is the same? Because their not. A kafir who doesnt pay jizyah cant keep his religion.

A muslim who doesnt pay zakat can. That is discrimination
 
 
 
Yes, even Muhammad attacked Muslims who refused to pay Zakat and took their women and children captive according to the Muslim scholar Saifur Rahman al Mubarakpuri:

 

One man in a book said   Oh noez.

Erm, Abu Bakr said in the following sentence, "b y Allah, I would fight against them even to secure the cord (used for hobbling the feet of a camel) which they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (as zakat) but now they have withheld it. Umar b. Khattab remarked: By Allah, I found nothing but the fact that Allah had opened the heart of Abu Bakr for (perceiving the justification of) fighting (against those who refused to pay Zakat) and I fully recognized that the (stand of Abu Bakr) was right. "

Your point doesn't follow. If they took religion seriously, both would be paying right up.

Pay jizya=keep religion, stay protected

Dont pay jizyah=death

Pay zakat=nothing you reportedly get a reward from Allah in the skies

Dont pay zakat= imprisonment (Muhammad took women and children of a tribe who refused to pay it as prisoners)

How are they the same?
 
 
they should be taught not fought.
 
 
 
I find it annoying that a lot of Muslims quote that verse without telling us that all the famous Muslim scholar believe it no longer applies, and those who believe it applies. believe it only applies because disbelieving in Allah=fighting Muslims according to them.

They are not being entirely honest !

 

Who cares which scholar said what, the Quran is the Quran and it says "Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.". You, deceptively tried to quote it out of context.

Everytime you make up a lie, i get motivated to make an entire atrticle about it on wikiislam debunking it.

Now i will create an article just about that verse with evidence from quran hadith and scholars.

The context was initially muslims who where in ihram (a state that muslims must be in during pilgrimage), and muslims werent allowed to fight during pilgrimage. Thats why muhammad "revealed" this verse. just incase they have to fight.

thats the context according to al suyuti.

The crux of the argument is whether jizya is oppressive. You'd find the intention was based on granting recognition & rights. It was a reciprocal relationship.

Sir Thomas W. Arnold in his Call to Islam, states:

" This tax was not imposed on the Christians, as some would have us think, as a penalty for their refusal to accept the Muslim faith. Rather, it was paid by them in common with the other dhimmis or non-Muslim subjects of the state whose religion precluded them from serving in the army, in return for the protection secured for them by the arms of the Muslims. When the people of Hirah contributed the sum agreed upon, they expressly mentioned that they paid this jizyah on condition that 'the Muslims and their leader protect us from those who would oppress us, whether they be Muslims or others.
"

Had the opposite been true, it would simply would have forced them into debt. And this is patently false.

Athough there were certainly exceptions (which the anti-Islam ideologues selectively cite), the general rule was–as Professor Cohen mentions–that the Muslims levied reasonable taxes (a graduated tax based on the capability of the dhimmi), whereas Christians crippled the Jews with unreasonable taxes. In fact, we have a primary text of a Jew who lived in Europe and then moved to the Muslim world; he compares the taxes between the two places:

In the thirteenth century, Jacob b. Elijah of Venice, a Jew, left his home in France for Venice and later settled in the Muslim East. Blaming Christians for the concentration of Jews in moneylending, Jacob compared the Jewish plight in Christian lands to their more favorable economic situation in Muslim countries. In a well-known polemical letter…Jacob wrote:

“Among the Orientals, each [Jewish] person makes his livelihood from whatever is his occupation. And, while Arab rulers may be wicked and sinful, they do possess reason and understanding. They take a prescribed tax each year, from the older ones according to his security and from the young according to his youthfulness. It is not this way in our [European] lands nor is it done in our place that way. Our kings and princes think only how to assail and fall upon us, in order to take away our gold and silver.”

Jacob thus tells us that Jews living in Muslim lands enjoyed occupational diversification and that the taxes Oriental Jews paid were fair rather than arbitrary and exorbitant. Though simplistic, his comparison is accurate, and it shows that, even in the Middle Ages, Jews sensed that the contrast between Jewish well-being in East and West had much to do with economics.

What you need to disprove is my claim that Jizyah is not discriminatory and that islam teaches to fight kafir till they pay jizyah

Sahih hadith:

 
Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord, has ordered us to fight you till you worship Allah Alone or give Jizya (i.e. tribute); and our Prophet has informed us that our Lord says:-- "Whoever amongst us is killed (i.e. martyred), shall go to Paradise to lead such a luxurious life as he has never seen, and whoever amongst us remain alive, shall become your master."
Sahih Bukhari 4: 53:386
 

Islamic source for more info:  http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/8605/2/ 

If you delay paying jizyah, this is what the islamic empire did to the kafirs

 
Hisham reported on the authority of his father that Hisham b. Hakim b. Hizam happened to pass by people, the farmers of Syria, who had been made to stand in the sun. He said: What is the matter with them? They said: They have been detained for Jizya. Thereupon Hisham said: I bear testimony to the fact that I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah would torment those who torment people in the world.
Sahih Muslim 32:6328
 
 
 
Umar (a muslim caliph) said that kafir may pay jizya in lowliness

 
Summon the people to God; those who respond to your call, accept it from them, but those who refuse must pay the poll tax out of humiliation and lowliness. If they refuse this, it is the sword without leniency. Fear God with regard to what you have been entrusted

I hate the amount of neg the OP gets.

Pretty much every post he makes is backed by various Tasfir, Hadith, Quranic verses, Fatwa and so on, and yet you still get people negging him because they don;t like people questioning Islam. It's pathetic.

attacking an opponent’s motives or character rather than the policy or position they maintain : vicious ad hominem attacks."

No, I put the things you quote out of context into context.

Not another one of these... *facepalm*

israel is a war mongering state though. thats not a good example.

because of israel, iraq was invaded.

So he should not be neg'd after people show the obvious flaws in his "back-up"? It is you who is being pathetic by claiming that people should not be in disagreement with him, i.e. neg him, while the refutations that explain clearly why he is wrong falls on deaf ears to you.

But continue to take the words and twisted evidence of someone with an obvious agenda, as gospel, while the people who have actually grown and experienced Islam don't know what they are talking about according to you.

I'm done wasting my time here as nobody is here to learn, but to make accusations with absolutely no intention of listening to the truth.

No, you just quote single sentences, you are deceitful, Islam is the truth and will always prevail.

No, I don't admit it, since when did I even indicate that I did.

so your syaing that you dontadmit i quoted a tafsir?

Then WTH is tafsir ibn kathir and tafsir of al-suyuti doing in the OP.

you are truly delusional and irrational.
 
 
 
you maybe be a "dhimmi", or at least you would make an excellent one IMO.

learn what that is

 

Can't be bothered to look it up - is it a good thing or a bad thing?

Show me the context, according to the Quran.

Lets keep it to the Quran, rather thean the opinions of men.

ad hominem |ˈad ˈhämənəm|
adverb & adjective
• attacking an opponent’s motives or character rather than the policy or position they maintain : vicious ad hominem attacks.

A clear indication you're loosing the argument, ask the devil to whisper some insults to you that you can use on me.

WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING THE QUESTION, ALLOW ME TO DEFEND ISLAM AGAINST YOUR LIES ON WIKI-ISLAM!

Mate there's no point in arguing with this guy...he starts a thread like this everyday...he has nothing better to do.
 
 
 
thousands?

 

millions.. approx. five million.
 
 
 
You did something like this last time where you refused to answer simple questions.

Sorry but your trying to be clever again. its not worth talking to you.

You will see that i responded to every single one of your questions. What do you mean by "answered". Lol, Muslims always play the semantics game.

 

Loser leave Islam alone.
 
 
 
x.

Yeah. I was reading your post before him, and it was all fine, and suddenly he responded afterwards and started accusing you all these utter nonsense!?

I was like what!?

Mate, that guy is really incoherent. He wouldn't listen to anyone other then his 'internet' sources. Weird guy.

I'm just waiting for this post to be closed really.

Very true. Im guessing he's behind the edits of the Islam wiki

Owh, is it?  

He must have written something great about the religion on the wiki  
 
 
 
if religion didn't exist, hitler wouldn't have killed thousands of jews. if religion didn't exist, no one would be preaching on a student forum.

Conflicting ideas = war.
Religion causes conflict, not peace.

 

Actually the Holocaust wasn't a religous persecution, it was to do with ethnicity. Thats why many Jews who had converted to Christianity etc were still murdered.
 
 
I don't mean to be intolerant, but all the primates who believe this shouldn't be on a forum for intelligent people.
 
 
 
I'm surprised a book from a religion of peace talks about violence so much.

 

You have the Israeli flag up there, you seem to be Jewish.
Have you ever read the Old Testament of the Bible? Believe me, you'll be even more surprised.

There are more violent verses in the Bible than in the Qur'an.
 
 
 
Some Muslims quote the verse below to make it seem like Islam is a fair and peaceful religion which fights only in self defence:

[COLOR=&quot;Blue&quot;][I]
To summarise this thread, most of the famous muffasirun (Quran scholars) such as al-Suyuti and Ibn Kathir mention that most scholars ruled that this verse was abrogated and no longer applies because Muhammad fought people who didnt fight him

 

I stopped reading there because it proved that your understanding of what is meant by 'abrogation' is hilariously incorrect, within context and without context. I'll deal with why in a comprehensive thread explaining the errors of people like yourself. I'll reply to your quote of me elsewhere in the forums later on, when I'm more awake. Probably will have it done on the weekend when I return to reply to the various quotes on TSR by various people...

The 'primates' being Muslims, or being the ones who think that Muslims actually believe this and that the OP's laughable analysis of these Islamic jurists sickeningly out-of-context is actually correct?

Oh, cool. (I'm glad.) They should look out the window towards their local Muslim neighbours, who are bringing samosas over every other week, organising charity events and so forth.

It still targeted jews. People had no choice but to convert - If there was no religion, people wouldn't have had to convert to anything.
 
 
 
One man in a book said   Oh noez.

 

 

Would +rep you but I'm out of it. But just to let you know, this really made me  

 
 
 
 
I don't recall saying that... you must have a very imaginative mind

 

 

LOL. The respond in this post is hilarious!
