Bulgaria's constitutional court said Tuesday it had annulled the election of
three members of parliament over irregularities in polling stations for
expatriates who cast their votes in Turkey.

A total 18,358 votes cast in 23 polling stations in Turkey -- including 18,140
votes for the Turkish minority Movement for Rights and Freedoms party -- should
be excluded from the final count due to irregularities, the court ruled.

Some 4.3 million people voted in the July 5 election last year.

As a result of Tuesday's ruling means, one MRF seat has now been awarded to the
ruling right-wing GERB party, giving it 117 lawmakers in the 240-seat
legislature.

The two other MRF deputies will be replaced by fellow members of their party,
following the re-distribution of votes.

Bulgaria's prosecution opened a probe in October into allegations that voters
with dual Bulgarian and Turkish citizenship had voted twice, while people who
had not turned up at polling stations in Turkey were registered as having voted.

The MRF, however, protested against the court ruling Tuesday, calling it "wrong
and vicious." It said it would appeal the decision and also take it to the
Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights.
