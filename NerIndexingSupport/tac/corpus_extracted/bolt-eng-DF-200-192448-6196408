 
 
The Federal Republic of the British Isles
 
 
Step 1
Devolve Wales, Scotland and England into Kernow, Wessex, Sussex, London, Cymru, Ulster, Mercia, East Midlands, Anglia, York, Lancaster, Northumbria, Caledonia and Alba.

Give each region/state their own PR elected parliament and capital and allow them to make their own laws. (Apart from a few things like foreign policy and taxation.)

The UK is falling apart because it's too Anglo-centric and because Westminster is unable to serve the needs of 60 million people all at the same time. Devolution will allow people from different areas and cultures to be represented more effectively and not be so reliant on London for everything. Splitting up England into regions will also mean Wales and Scotland won't feel so sidelined, and might set the path for the union of Ireland once again.

Step 2
Strip London as the capital of the UK and instate Liverpool as the new federal capital. London is a great city, but it bares too many ties with corporate greed and imperialism.

A new start is needed, and Liverpool is the perfect place: being roughly in the middle of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland; being associated with many a positive thing about UK culture, and the fact it will bring much needed regeneration to the north of England.

Step 3
Invite Ireland to join, pointing out that a union with Britain and Northern Ireland is far better than a union with Europe. Emphasise that London will no longer dictate to them what to do, and that they can do as they please. Splitting Ireland into the historical countries of Munster, Leister and Connacht will mean that Ireland can be united once again without having to argue whether the country is catholic or protestant.

Step 4
Remove all political power and public funding from the Queen and royal families and replace them with a constitution and a President who'll vow to uphold it. Or maybe Lord Protector sounds better  

The Queen should serve absolutely no purpose in a modern day nation and should be removed immediately. If any tradionalists want to keep her, then they can feel free to pay for her themselves.

The federal government should only be allowed to meddle in areas such as foreign policy, armed forces, big infrastructure projects and certain areas of taxation. Real powers should lie in local levels, because they can see what's up and can more effectively deal with it without worrying about repurcussions elsewhere.

Feel free to point out any flaws  
 
 
Boo. Federal Europe FTW.

You have a much greater chance of getting your voice heard in a federal UK than a federal Europe. Why an earth would you prefer the latter?

If a federal Europe does prove itself to be a good idea, we can always integrate ourselves at a later stage. But if it proves itself to be a bad idea and we're already a part of it, it's going to be much, much harder to get out of.

I don't believe it is remotely Anglocentric, I believe it's London-centric. And I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing, considering London is essentially the jewel in the Crown of Europe, economically speaking.

Moreover, it's not falling apart at all.

Thanks for the info, but it's irrelevant to the argument.

London doesn't need to be the capital of the UK in order to be an economic powerhouse. Just look at New York City.

The UK being London-centric politically is an extremely bad thing because the rest of the nation is pretty much neglected. Local areas need much more power in order to sort out their problems, and as it stands they can't really do much about it without authority from Westminster.

 
The people of England have rejected this.
 

I'm not sure why the people of England would reject local regions having more power. :/

 
  Not on your life.
 

Why not? It gives hope and oppurtunity to the North of England. Why does EVERYTHING have to be based in London?

 
You ignorant sod.
 

At least I provided arguments, where are yours?
 
 
This is relevant to my interests (although I don't agree with some of your points, 2 seems a little silly -- surely in a federation the capital has little significance other than that it is the seat of government, and 4 kinda breaks the point i'm about to make...)

It also gets onto a pet peeve of mine -- the epic failure of the British Empire. It shouldn't have been an Empire, it should have been a federation.

There's still time though. Devolve as above (or even further, to county-level), and invite commonwealth countries to join a Commonwealth Free Trade Area or join a Federal Commonwealth with a directly-democratically-elected government with a fixed budget of 1% flat tax that serves only as a way to address the Commonwealth collectively...

*daydreams*

I didn't say it did, however frankly London is a city which unites the country: I suspect the vast majority of our Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish, Cornish and Northern citizens have friends and family in London for one obvious reason: the economic ties. I think that is immensely valuable in a capital - far more important that geography.

Just as the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, a unified city is economically important - London is so significant because of the sheer volume of activity which takes place there. Again this is not a capital issue. The UK would necessarily remain London-centric wherever the capital.

As for neglecting the rest of the nation, there is a trickle-down economic effect.

They did in every poll that was put to them, and decisively killed off the plans in the North East devolution referendum.

Liverpool's a hole full of weird folk.

No you didn't. You made an assertion that anyone with a grain of sense can see is nonsense rhetoric: "the Queen should serve absolutely no purpose in a modern day nation". Within that, you also have a ridiculous appeal to novelty as well as a couple of other logical fallacies poured on for good measure.

Abuse is no argument.

You sir, know the score. I'd rep you but I wasted it on some lulzy post elsewhere.

It hardly unites the country: it pretty much just dictates to us what we can and can't do. Because many people have relatives who work there, it doesn't mean it's uniting the country, all it means is London is stealing the minds which could've gone to use befitting other local areas.

London is overly important, and that's the problem. It's the centre of sport, of finance, of government, of everything. It sucks all responsibility from everywhere else in the country and as a result it's way overpopulated has an absolutely arseload of problems which need dealing with.

London would work far more effectively as a financial centre if a lot of things were moved elsewhere around the country. Allowing other places some oppurtunities would mean London wouldn't be so overwhelmed, and as a result could divert funds from areas such as policing and traffic control into improving mass transit and other positive projects.... theoretically  

As for the Queen, I just don't see why I should be paying for an unelected leader, who lives in luxury and excess and provides very little in return.
 
 
liverpool capital lol

its not even the 4th biggest city in england and capital of culture my arse

Federal Democratic Republic of the British Isles

You can't have a state like that without the word Democratic in its title.
 
 
You stole your username from the founder of Totse. Theif.
 
 
What idealistic, juvenile drivel.

I sincerely hope you never attain a political office.

Oh, and 'The Federal Republic of the British Isles' is a bland, unoriginal name. Do this, and Britain would just merge with all the other dull republics out there. The 'United Kingdom' is much better.

But it is truly British, and truly international too. It doesn't have the feel of an English city, or a Scottish city, or a Welsh city, or an Irish one: it is British, and that's what should be expected from our nation's capital.

As for 'dictating' - that's the government, not the city.

It's not overwhelmed. It's fine.

 
, and as a result could divert funds from areas such as policing and traffic control into improving mass transit and other positive projects.... theoretically  
 

How? One benefit of high population density is the economies of scale on public services. Taking mass transit: London has, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the best mass transit system in the UK expressly because it has a dense population.

 
As for the Queen, I just don't see why I should be paying for an unelected leader,
 

Because she's the head of state. Do you think you shouldn't pay for judges? Or Civil Servants?

Moreover, the Queen does not even take a salary for her work.

 
who lives in luxury and excess
 

That's not your business. Would you stop paying an MP because he's well-off? Of course not.

 
and provides very little in return.
 

Rubbish. The Queen is by far and away the best person for the job.

I generally approve of the concept, though not how you've set it out.

And I'll die before my city is stripped of its status as a capital so a rabble of Scousers can be placated.

And I abhor the idea of a British President, though I am fairly Republican. I'd like each community within each region to pick delegates which can decide things at a regional level. These then vote on a delegate which represents them at a national level, and all the delegates come together and decide on national policy. A little less party politics would be nice.

I don't think the Irish would like to merge with us.

I like the idea of devolution and decentralisation however.
 
 
So...you want to essentially make the UK into USAv2?

Hardly surprising, seeing as its readership has been declining whilst most similar current affairs magazines have been increasing. They just want to draw attention to themselves. It's what one has to do after pouring loads of money down the drain in ill-fated marketing costs.

Power would be to segrgated, each state would most likely be to individualistic without a common aim or goal.

I cant see anyone removing London as the capital, why would you want to ? Its been Britains stronghold for centuries.

Invite Ireland to join a union with Britain... hmmm they left once I cant see them coming back
 
 
Yes lets turn the UK into a conglomeration of even smaller countries loosely linked. I am sorry but I think this is stupid idea, the last thing we need to to do is add more levels of administration to a nation that really isnt that big.

It's a fair point -- don't apologise for it :P. I'd argue we've already got perfectly good county-level administrations, it could do no harm to move some of the functionality of westminster downwards.

I don't deny that bureaucratic expansionism is a problem, but I'd argue that swollen government spending encourages bureaucracy to grow sideways, not upwards -- the current cabinet is the biggest there's ever been in recent history, and each of those ministers and junior ministers has their own little empire of staff.

Federalism is good for many reasons, but one of them would be that it would require us to rethink the rightful role of government in this country, and how best to structure it to fulfil those goals.

Why do they even bother? Hell will freeze over before the monarchy is abolished during the rest of the Queen's reign. It would even take a lot for the monarchy to be abolished when Charles ascends.

Deluded, uneducated socialists.

Will be interesting to see what their advertising revenues (and list of advertisers) will be in 18 months time. Many in recent years have been big corporations that seek to "influence" Government policy. Wonder whether lots of them will have moved over to the Spectator by then.
 
 
Who says Ireland would want to give up its independence/sovereignty?

And also, join back with a country that treated it so badly in the past? I guess the war of independence and the potato famine mean little then, eh?

There would only be a few million people in each region, bit pointless really.

The Irish, unlike you, will care about there countries sovereignty and history.

 
Step 4
Remove all political power and public funding from the Queen and royal families and replace them with a constitution and a President who'll vow to uphold it. Or maybe Lord Protector sounds better  
 

A constitution that can change or not? And how do we select this president, and what happens when certain regions don’t support the president or visa-versa, the president has full support from parliament and can go whatever he likes.

 
The Queen should serve absolutely no purpose in a modern day nation and should be removed immediately. If any tradionalists want to keep her, then they can feel free to pay for her themselves.
 

The Queen doesn’t cost us a penny, the Monarchy turns a profit for the government. Our constitutional monarchy has served a purpose since its creation and nothing has changed.

 
The federal government should only be allowed to meddle in areas such as foreign policy, armed forces, big infrastructure projects and certain areas of taxation. Real powers should lie in local levels, because they can see what's up and can more effectively deal with it without worrying about repurcussions elsewhere.
 

But that’s life, the national government has to make decisions that benefit the whole country and some may lose out but unlucky. Everybody can not have all things

Granted it wouldn't be the UK in name, but this new political entity would cover the same territory as the UK pre-1921. Where Ireland was in theory an equal and integral part of the country.
 
 
Nice idea, OP!  
Federalism is a nice alternative, one I am open to.

However, I think splitting England so much is unwarranted and slightly obscure, as those kind of cultural separations don't really occur, as opposed to a country like Ireland, where provincial separation in a federal govt wouldn't be looked down on. I'd suggest more rounded regional, rather than county, separation? Feel free to disagree.

The only major gripe (after an admittedly quick scan through) is this:

No.

Just no.

I would strongly oppose this as a joint UK-ROI citizen, arguing, among other things, that separating the provinces in this way is irrelevant due to the already separation of Ulster over the ROI and the UK being problematic.

Why does the separation have to be done on a cultural basis? This is federalisation, not balkanisation.

In pre-civil war US (possibly the poster-child for federalisation), the initial borders for each state were drawn semi-arbitrarily, but subtly different cultural norms and state laws differentiated the states into the culturally seperable entities we see today.

Granted, England has been considered a united country since the days of the Saxon Kings, but we already allow recycling and public transport to be done along county lines, all this proposal does is increase the role of the county council and decrease the role of the national legeslature.

Is it? If anything it is more associated with the western isles but it is just a direct translation from Gaelic to Scotland. At least I think. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I agree in the principle of federalism and increasing the powers of local council, however I just fail to see the practicality of the counties as a form of governance.

I just sense a severe state of political apathy on the part of voters if a new, artificial connection is being created for people to try and feel a loyalty to. I get that this changes over time, but would be problematic to begin with.

I would much prefer a system of devolution for the separate 'nations' within the UK as a more practical function. Systems such as recycling and public transport could still be delegated to a district level, similar to the US.

But I accept your position.  
 
 
Over my dead body.

God Save the Queen.

Can I ask, why do we in Wales have to be beholden to the Welsh-speaking minority in the terminology of our own nation? That's no better than the London-centric vision of the British Isles we have now. I do not wish to swap rabid metropolitanism for rabid Celticism.

That's a fair point.

It depends on the reasons for the disconnect. I'd argue that the main reason is an "us an them" attitude on the part of both the voters and the politicians. I'd argue this could be alleviated by moving the politicians closer to the voters. Where the guy in charge of health policy lives down the road, and the housing minister queues behind you in the supermarket for groceries, and your vote is one of 80 000 rather than 60 000 000, it's hard to feel disconnected from politics.

I agree that it could be a solution, I am only sceptical when you consider turnout for votes such as local council elections etc. Political participation would be evident in House/Senate elections, and Executive elections (if you follow the US system), but supposed elections at district level would still suffer and popular participation at an even lower level would decrease.

This could be dangerous if power is given out over such small areas that the actions of the local politician act directly in the lives of the voters. Then again, I conceed that, when this point is made evident, popular participation may increase.

What makes you think that the turnout isn't proportional to the amount of power vested in the respective legeslatures?  

People are generally rational creatures. It doesn't cost much to go out and vote (you've only got to walk to the polling booth; no more than 30 mins opportunity cost), but if all your local authority affects are recycling and traffic, and your vote is one of 80 000, then what's the point?

I'd expect two things to increase turnout -- increased sovereignty of a legeslature, and decreased size of a legeslature (the more your vote counts for, the more motivated you'll be to get out and vote). County-sized "states" with power over everything except foreign policy and a couple of other things should expect turnouts on the same level as Swiss cantons.
 
 
I'm not against a Federal Republic of Great Britain, but I'm not a fan of splitting the government into county sized levels. It makes each individual state rather impotent, I'd rather split it it into more or less what we've got now (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) though England may need splitting somewhere to make it fair.

Depends how it is done. I'm in favour of stronger regional politics but not at the expense of being lumbered with some lump of land mass I do not feel is part of my region. This is probably why the NE devolution idea failed. Can you really see County Durham and Northumberland together politically? I can't. Rather than split it into regions, just promote counties or something. You wouldn't split England and lump Yorkshire with Lancashire saying it's north England would you?

Fine. I'm already paying for 'murderers' to have abortions anyway so I'll make do with the Queen too. You see, making a political statement based on whether something deserves your tax is not the sole exclusive of the existence of the Crown.

Liverpool has had their share of imperialism. Might as well make the capital something more historic or neutral: Durham, York, or build a new capital and call it Avalon or something. That way it stops everyone from Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Glasgow from wanting their city to be the new capital. Bad enough with putting up with Manchester and Birmingham fanboys with the debate of 'Britain's second city' on here.

Federalism need not be based on the American model. There are other models out there.
