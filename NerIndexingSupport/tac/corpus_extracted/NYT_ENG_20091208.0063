Destinations like the Chattahoochee River National
Recreation Area, the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site
and Cumberland Island National Seashore are getting some promotion
help.

The National Park Service, which oversees operations of 66 parks
and historic sites in the Southeast, and the Southeast Tourism
Society will formally join forces to push park visitation by
entering into a "memorandum of understanding."

The "agreement," which does not commit either party to any
money, is an effort by the park service to partner with
organizations to better tell the stories of America's destination
treasures from the mountains to the seas, said Chris Abbett, NPS
assistant regional director/partnerships. The group will help the
park service market the destinations to drive up visitation and
bring them to the attention of tourism society members.

The need is there.

Hundreds of thousands visit the nation's parks annually, but
those numbers have been declining over the past decade, officials
said. The park service, trying to reacquaint the public with the
destinations, offered free admission to visitors twice this past
summer. And leaders are especially worried about young adult
visitation, which has been low as today's youth eschew the parks
for computers and text messaging.

And visitation has impact not just on the parks, but the
economic vitality of the communities that serve them, said Bill
Hardman, president and chief operating officer of the Southeast
Tourism Society. Attendance is also important to the sustainability
of the parks because visitors stress the need for continued funding
and support.

Abbett said urban sites run by the park did better this past
summer than distant counterparts like Yellowstone, perhaps because
of "staycations" and also because of documentary producer Ken
Burns' "The National Parks: America's Best Ideas" series.

Visiting Yellowstone National Park or Kennesaw Mountain National
Battlefield Park is more than trees and mounuments, but stories
about the men and women behind their designation, Abbett said,
alluding to Burns' series.

And Hardman said the partnership with the park service makes
sense for the Southeast Tourism Society because the Southeast has
the biggest NPS jewel of them all: Great Smoky Mountains National
Park.

"It's the most visited national park in the country," he said.
