Musharraf makes it into top ten dictators list

LONDON: Dubbed as a shrewd and skilful manipulator by his political opponents, President General Pervez Musharraf has achieved the dubious distinction of being ranked one of the worlds top 10 dictators. Kim Jong-il of North Korea, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Equatorial Guineas alleged cannibalistic ruler Teodoro Obiang Nguema also figure in the dictators list compiled by the British weekly magazine New Statesman and featured in its current issue. Our top 10 is a selection of men - there are currently no women dictators - who combine a high level of personal power with repressive practices, ranging from press censorship to fixing elections and, in the case of Equatorial Guineas Teodor Obiang Nguema, allegedly cannibalising political opponents, the report says. According to the magazine, the top five most repressive dictators (for freedom of speech) are: Kim Jong-il (North Korea); Isaias Afewerki (Eritrea); Saparmurat Niyazov (Turkmenistan); Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (Iran); and Senior General Than Shwe (Myanmar). Fidel Castro of Cuba figures in the list along with Hu Jintao of China as the most corrupt dictators.There is plenty of kitsch excess - bouffant hairstyles, super-sized yachts and a fondness of khaki - and also plenty of suffering: despite a global fear of dictators running amok, the only people they tend to harm are their own, the magazine notes. Their misdemeanours, however, are often ignored. While North Koreas Kim Jong-il, possibly the worlds cruellest autocrat, remains beyond the diplomatic pale, the west has long-standing marriages of convenience with undemocratic rulers such as Pakistans Pervez Musharraf and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, it says. daily times monitor

The world is waking up to the reality a wee too late.

However, he is a better dictator than most.

He has done things that are positive, all said and done.
 
 
 

Certainly a step up for an individual whose government was recently characterized by the  New York Times  as :

 
....... a garden-variety military dictatorship.
 
 
 
You can accuse China of many things but calling Hu Jintao as a corrupt dictator is taking it a little too far. AFAIK his integrity is pretty tight or Jiang Zemin would have gotten rid of him at the first opportunity.......
 
 
I would like to congratulate Mr. Musharaf... atleast he made it into some top ten list... he should be proud...  
 
 
Tronic,

You are 400 per cent correct  .

Should make up for the personal disappointment of being down graded from 7 th place in  2005  to 17 th place in   2006  on Parades Dictator list  .
 
 
The Balochis feel that Tronic is a 1000% correct,
