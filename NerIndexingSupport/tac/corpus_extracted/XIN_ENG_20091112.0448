China Finance Corporation (CFC), a Xinhua-owned company, signed an agreement
with Deutsche Borse here Thursday, starting cooperation in the field of
financial information service.

Lu Wei, vice president of Xinhua, and Michael Schaefer, ambassador of Germany in
China, attended the signing ceremony.

According to the agreement, the two sides will cooperate in releasing global
financial news, analyzing market data, and providing information technology
service. Xinhua's self-developed financial information service platform "Xinhua
08," which is running by the CFC, will distribute data of Deutsche Borse.

Xinhua 08 will set up an office in Germany to collect financial information as
soon as possible, Lu said, adding it will launch a German edition soon.

He said Xinhua will write more stories on the Deutsche Borse to let more Chinese
know about it, which can contribute to the development of bilateral economic and
trade relations.

Schaefer said he hopes that Xinhua 08 can set up an office in Frankfurt,one of
the most important financial centers in the world. The German government will
continue its support to the cooperation.

According to the website of the Deutsche Borse, it is the world's largest stock
exchange organization by revenue, profitability and market capitalization. It
also operates Eurex, the world's largest derivatives market, active in Europe,
Asia and the United States.
