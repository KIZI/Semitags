Hi all

im Ruben and im trying to install Trac with Subversion in Linux
Centos. Im in the last step to finish the tutorial installation guide.
I have a doubt about mod_wsgi.

Im reading now the info about Wsgi ( http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracModWSGI
)but i dont't understand well all info.

"It is already possible to run Trac on top of mod_wsgi. This can be
done by writing the following application script.

import os

os.environ['TRAC_ENV'] = '/usr/local/trac/mysite'
os.environ['PYTHON_EGG_CACHE'] = '/usr/local/trac/mysite/eggs'

import trac.web.main
application = trac.web.main.dispatch_request"

What can i do exactly with this? If i understand well, i must put this
code in a file and then rename to .wsgi. But im not sure. Well, im not
sure of nothing.

Any help will be appreciated.

A lot of thanks.
