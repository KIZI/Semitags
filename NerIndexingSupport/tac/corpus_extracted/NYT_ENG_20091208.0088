Putting his stamp on one of the most venerable names
on Wall Street, the incoming chief executive of Morgan Stanley
announced a management shake-up on Tuesday that, for the most part,
signaled a smooth transition of leadership.

James P. Gorman, who will succeed John J. Mack as chief
executive on Jan. 1, named three confidants of Mack to important
roles, while demoting the executive who oversaw the bank's
lackluster sales and trading division.

Gorman, a lanky Australian whose ascension after just four years
at Morgan Stanley represents a potential break with the Mack years,
promoted Thomas R. Nides, Mack's chief administrative officer, to
the newly created post of chief operating officer.

He also named two executives to the position of co-president -- a
power-sharing arrangement that, in the past, has created headaches
at other banks. As co-presidents, Colm Kelleher, now chief
financial officer, and Paul J. Taubman, currently head of global
investment banking, will share responsibility for Morgan Stanley's
institutional securities operation, the bank's largest business in
terms of revenue.

While Gorman is generally following the lead of Mack, who will
remain chairman, the shake-up claimed at least one of Mack's top
executives. Michael J. Petrick, the head of sales and trading, was
demoted after his division fell behind those of rivals, notably
Goldman Sachs, as the financial markets soared this year. Morgan
Stanley said it was negotiating with Petrick about another
position.

Gorman and his team are moving to invigorate Morgan Stanley and
secure its position as a premier Wall Street bank. The departure of
Mack as chief executive was the end of an era for the bank, which
rode out the financial crisis with aid from the federal government
and a big investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan.

Ruth Porat will succeed Kelleher as chief financial officer. She
worked closely with the U.S. Treasury during the financial crisis,
acting as an adviser on the government rescue of Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac and other troubled institutions.

The current head of the institutional securities group, Walid
Chammah, will take over a previously announced position running
Morgan Stanley International, based in London.
