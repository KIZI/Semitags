Looks like Romney will win Virginia's Primary, so he can focus on other Super Tuesday states. It is beginning to look like Romney will be the main man for Republicans because of his steady base of support.

 
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has failed to qualify for Virginia's March 6 Republican primary, a development that adds to the challenges faced by the recent frontrunner in the GOP presidential race.
"After verification, RPV has determined that Newt Gingrich did not submit required 10k signatures and has not qualified for the VA primary," the Republican Party of Virginia announced early Saturday on its Twitter website.
Perry also fell short of the 10,000 signatures of registered voters required for a candidate's name to be on the primary ballot, but former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Rep. Ron Paul will be on the ballot.

He's the only one who stands any kind of chance. He's their John McCain this year.
 
 
I do hope Gingrich makes it for the book signings. I believe that's the second serious Presidential candidate to ever do that..run a book tour and campaign. Cain was probably the first.

Man..Republicans are ambidextrous!
 
 
Romney's religion is his worst enemy. Mormons aren't Christians according to the religious right. Of course, he's the only candidate that has any chance.

It ain't Romney's religion that's going to sink him. He's already populating he's "cabinent" with ex-Bush PNAC'ers and talking about attacking Iran.

That..and just about every day he says something that is just golden for Democratic ads.

Given your prerogatives, then if by some miracle, Mr. Sallow, a Republican should win, who that is left would you like to see in the White HOuse? It sounds like you don't care for any war talk, regardless of the circumstances. Early this morning, I saw on television that a firm link between AlQaeda and Iran was established and announced by the Obama administration. It sounded like war talk coming from the left aisle. What's the deal?

Just another example of the Republican Establishment trying to rig the game for Romney.

I really have to ask the question, if Romney is the strongest candidate the GOP has, then why do the party operatives have to pull out every stop to help him? And if he can't really stand toe to toe with Gingrich and Perry, both of whom have their flaws and shortcomings, what chance is he going to have against Obama, who is very charismatic, is going to have a billion dollar warchest and doesn't belong to a batshit crazy religion anymore?
 
 
Well, not to worry about politics today, Mr. Sallow...
Merry Christmas everyone
 
 credits and recipe 
I nominate The Gingerbread Man for President, this Christmas Eve's Day.  
 
 
 
Romney's religion is his worst enemy. Mormons aren't Christians according to the religious right. Of course, he's the only candidate that has any chance.

 

Well, a couple things on that. First, you are assuming that hostility towards Mormonism is the exclusive domain of the "Religious Right". It isn't. Gallup took a poll that says that 22% of the population won't vote for a Mormon. Which, by the way, should be a good enough reason for EVERY Republican to do a double take about this guy.

 In U.S., 22% Are Hesitant to Support a Mormon in 2012 

BUt if you go into the numbers, 18% of Republicans won't support a Mormon, but a whopping 27% of Democrats won't, either. The number for indepedents is 19%.

Religiously, 23% of protestants wont, with 16% of Catholics and 22% of "non-Christians".

And here's the thing. It really is a liability. Mormons believe in some truly weird stuff, and they have a really bizarre history. Things the MSM will be happy to inform us of- AFTER Romney secures the nomination.

Secondly, beyond his religion, Romney has a lot of other problems. He made his money screwing working folks, a fact Obama will not neglect to remind people of. He's stiff and robotic and generally not likable. He occassionally says insentive things like "Corporations are people, too" and "I'll bet you $10,000." and my personal favorite, 'My sons working on my campaign is serving their country".

Now if you want to argue that he's stronger than the other six dwarves, you can argue that. I think Perry would be a stronger candidate if he can rise above the media character assassination of him. I think Gingrich would be a stronger candidate because he's smart and articulate. I think both men have been sandbagged by a GOP establishment that drank the koolaid on Romney.
 
 
 
I do hope Gingrich makes it for the book signings. I believe that's the second serious Presidential candidate to ever do that..run a book tour and campaign. Cain was probably the first.

Man..Republicans are ambidextrous!

 

Cain is doing the same thing.

A very perceptive and prescient post.

Romney is the weakest GOP candidate the establishment has picked ever. This derives from their absolute fear of the social conservatives, aka 'religious right', taking over the GOP, so the establishment stiff arms the Sco-cons.

Soon the Soc-cons will take their toys and go play elsewhere and hand the national politics to the Democrats for the next twenty years, afterwhich the soc-cons will dominate the political scene for decades.

All because the GOP establishment has devolved into a bunch of reactionary, dim-witted Christ haters and cant allow the Soc-cons power for even a single term in the Oval Office. They threw a fit over Reagan and spent the four years of GHW Bushes term purging Soc-cons from the GOP national leadership.

Politics in this country has become so Byzantine the leadership groups cannot accomplish the simplest of goals that require even the slightest sacrifice of their own interest for the common good, even within political parties for their own long-term gain.

They deserve the obliteration that is coming to them.
 
 
Can't Gingrich just lie. It worked for obama in Indiana last time.

How about another democrat lie.

 Bachmann, Huntsman, Santorum fail to make Va. ballot - Virginia Politics - The Washington Post 

Republican presidential candidates Michele Bachmann, Jon Huntsman and Rick Santorum failed to qualify for the Virginia ballot, according to state GOP officials.

Four candidates — former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Ron Paul (Texas) — turned in thousands of signatures by the deadline

To be a democrat IS to lie. They will lie about anything. The entire democratic party and all of the democrat voters have lying as the very basis of their party.
 
 
 
Four candidates — former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Ron Paul (Texas) — turned in thousands of signatures by the deadline

 

Yes, they did turn in thousands of signatures by the deadline. But the reason you would read news from today instead of stopping with that cliffhanger from yesterday is that it turns out they  didn't have enough validated signatures  :

 
Former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Gov. Rick Perry failed to submit enough valid signatures to qualify for the Virginia primary ballot, state GOP officials said Friday evening and early Saturday.

The Republican Party of Virginia announced early Saturday that Gingrich and Perry failed to submit 10,000 signatures of registered voters required to get their names on the ballot for the March 6 primary.

“After verification, RPV has determined that Newt Gingrich did not submit required 10k signatures and has not qualified for the VA primary,” the party announced on Twitter.

The rejection is a significant setback for the Gingrich campaign since he is leading the polls in Virginia among likely Republican voters and is seen as a strong contender for the nomination.

Perry’s campaign told state election officials it had submitted 11,911 signatures, and Gingrich’s campaign said it submitted 11,050 signatures. State party officials spent Friday night validating the signatures.

 
 
 
Ohhhhhh! Leaving only Romney on the ballot!

Well, it works for me. ABO.
 
 
Gingrich is the guy who overuses the word "fundamentally" in all of his appearances right?      
 
 
I actually think this benefits Ron Paul more than Mitt Romney.

This crap happens every election in our office. Some candidate gathers ONLY the required number of signatures (despite us telling them to gather MUCH MORE than the required amount) and doesn't turn them in until the last minute. If they don't end up with enough valid signatures, they are left with not enough time to get them.

No, they were checked and weren't valid. It wasn't the GOP, but the State Election Board volunteers that found them invalid, not the GOP.
 
 
The GOP couldn't run a one car funeral.
 
 
It seems odd to me that the State would have volunteers checking signatures on a nomination petition. Oh well, states rights...
 
 
I think if the power brokers had their way they would just select the candidates for us and eliminate all this voting nonsense. I think most people would agree with that too and thats a sad commentary on America today because they are in effect selecting the candidate but just indirectly instead of directly. They use back room deals and money to make sure who they wants gets put forward. Pretty much everyone knows this but they figure that's just the way it is.

Funny, you guys do that all the time.... Kerry Loses? Well, it can't be because he was an awful candidate.... It must be the voting machines!

Gore loses Florida? Bush's brother must have fixed the vote.

And no doubt, you'll flood this thread with articles from crazymoonbat.com proving that was the case... but don't waste my time.

I suspect that these guys will win on appeal, but it annoys me that the GOP establishment has such little trust in its own voters that we won't have a choice. If Romney is a better candidate, let him beat these guys in a fair fight.
 
 
I think I read somewhere that Gingrich didn't get on the MO and OH ballots either.

Gingrich has no organization, little money, few endorsements, and even fewer complimentary things said about him by people who worked with him in the 1990s.
 
 
I repeat, Gingrich's campaign is a book tour.

He doesn't want to get elected.

RICHMOND, Va. - The campaign of Newt Gingrich assailed a "failed system" for his failure to make it onto the ballot for the Virginia Republican primary.

The state GOP announced early Saturday morning that Gingrich's campaign had failed to submit the required number of signatures to qualify for the March 6 primary. On Friday it was announced that Texas Gov. Rick Perry had also failed to qualify.

Gingrich, Perry fail to make Va. Ballot

The state's election board requires candidates petitioning for inclusion in the primary to file 10,000 signatures from registered voters, including 400 from each of Virginia's 11 congressional districts.

It was reported Thursday that Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman were also off the ballot. So far, only former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Congressman Ron Paul are officially on the primary ballot.

The proof is in observing who benifits from all this crap, jack-ass.

While stupid irrelevant topics get plastered across every view screen in America, Romneys serious ethics problems like him destroying government records as his term as govenor came to an end, those things are compeltely ignored by the media.

One after another the media has destroyed Palin, Bachman, Perry, Cain, and now they are working on Gingrich. The Paulbots are piling on stupidly thinking that their guy wont get the same treatment when he gets in the lead, in fact it has already started.

Conservatives have to settle on ONE anti-establishment candidate and tell the world, 'If you dont like him, piss off.'

But odds are they wont do that because most of them are easily bought or brow beat into submission. A life time of playing lapdog to Washington DC neocons will do that to a person.

Bachman, Santorum and Huntsman also got dumped.

The way the process works, the people who review the ballots will pass the favored candidates, even accepting Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in some cases, while eliminating the signatures of those they dont want on the ballot enough that the person does not qualify.

Gingrich had an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 signatures while the threshold was only 10,000. The Virginia GOP simply bent the rules to leave only Paul and Romney on the ticket and that is obvious.

So please, go grow a brain.

You're a fucking idiot. Bachman, Huntsman and Santorum didn't get enough signatures. Newt paid $1.50 per signature, got over 11,000, but many were not legitimate. That's why you have to get about twice as many signatures as needed in order to make sure you have enough legitimate ones. Which Mittens and Paul did.

You would think, as 'smart' as Newt claims to be, he would take the needed steps to get on the ballot in his own adopted state!

You're a fucking idiot. Bachman, Huntsman and Santorum didn't get enough signatures. Newt paid $1.50 per signature, got over 11,000, but many were not legitimate. That's why you have to get about twice as many signatures as needed in order to make sure you have enough legitimate ones. Which Mittens and Paul did.

You would think, as 'smart' as Newt claims to be, he would take the needed steps to get on the ballot in his own adopted state!  

 

So they only people the REPUBLICAN Party lets on the ballot are Mitt and the Crazy Guy, and you don't smell a fix? Really?

I hear Mitt Romney is going to hire Tonya Harding as his campaign director. Expect a lot of broken kneecaps in the next few weeks.
 
 
The simple fact is that to run for President you need to lay the groundwork in advance, build a network of individuals to go out and get signatures in each state where it is necessary. Everybody but Paul and Romney blew it in Virginia and this has to be a warning shot for all the others that they had best make sure they get on the states ballots that are left. Everybody knew the rules so there is no excuse. I take that back, it appears that some do not know the rules.

 
“Voters deserve the right to vote for any top contender, especially leading candidates,” Michael Krull, Gingrich’s campaign director, said in a statement. “We will work with the Republican Party of Virginia to pursue an aggressive write-in campaign to make sure that all the voters of Virginia are able to vote for the candidate of their choice.”
Virginia law, however, says that “no write-in shall be permitted on ballots in primary elections.” The state party’s decision is a setback for Gingrich and may benefit Romney as it underscores the campaign organization needed for a run for the White House.

 

 Gingrich, Perry Fail to Make Virginia Primary - Bloomberg 
 
 
 
When is Newt going to come to the conclusion that he is only a "footnote" in the 2012 GOP race to the nomination. It is over. Mitt will be the nominee. But keep signing and selling your lame book. I guess it makes up for the cash you are losing now that Freddie and Fannie are not clients.

 

Maybe he came to that conclusion even before his surge and has just been milking it for all he can. Callista wants to keep going to Tiffany's, after all.
 
 
 
Va Primary: Gingrich, Perry fail to get on ballot.

     

 

My sentiments exactl;y

 
 
 
 
Looks like Romney will win Virginia's Primary, so he can focus on other Super Tuesday states. It is beginning to look like Romney will be the main man for Republicans because of his steady base of support.

 
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has failed to qualify for Virginia's March 6 Republican primary, a development that adds to the challenges faced by the recent frontrunner in the GOP presidential race.
"After verification, RPV has determined that Newt Gingrich did not submit required 10k signatures and has not qualified for the VA primary," the Republican Party of Virginia announced early Saturday on its Twitter website.
Perry also fell short of the 10,000 signatures of registered voters required for a candidate's name to be on the primary ballot, but former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Rep. Ron Paul will be on the ballot.

 

 My Way News - GOP: Gingrich, Perry will not be on Va. Ballot 

 

 

So let me get this straight: These guys say they want to be Leader of the Free World, but they don't even have their shit together enough to qualify for the primary ballot? Rick Perry I can understand because he's an idiot. But this just confirms for me that Newt's not actually a serious candidate.

I can't believe anyone cannot see right through Newt.
 
 
 
 
 
Wait a minute. What does the "establishment GOP" have to do with the Little Dumber Boy and the Gingrich who Stole Christmas not getting the required number of signatures to be on the ballot?

 

He submitted enough signatures... the GOP is challenging their validity.

 

No, they were checked and weren't valid. It wasn't the GOP, but the State Election Board volunteers that found them invalid, not the GOP.

 

No, actually, the GOP makes teh decision, not the State Board of Elections. They can appeal to the state board, but I suspect what they are hoping is that one or both are eliminated before the appeals are heard.

Bachman, Santorum and Huntsman also got dumped.

The way the process works, the people who review the ballots will pass the favored candidates, even accepting Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in some cases, while eliminating the signatures of those they dont want on the ballot enough that the person does not qualify.

I hear Mitt Romney is going to hire Tonya Harding as his campaign director. Expect a lot of broken kneecaps in the next few weeks.

 

No. Virginia has the strictest ballot access requirements in the nation. Every candidate is aware of this, or should be.
 
 
 
 
Romney's religion is his worst enemy. Mormons aren't Christians according to the religious right. Of course, he's the only candidate that has any chance.

 

Well, a couple things on that. First, you are assuming that hostility towards Mormonism is the exclusive domain of the "Religious Right". It isn't. Gallup took a poll that says that 22% of the population won't vote for a Mormon. Which, by the way, should be a good enough reason for EVERY Republican to do a double take about this guy.

 In U.S., 22% Are Hesitant to Support a Mormon in 2012 

BUt if you go into the numbers, 18% of Republicans won't support a Mormon, but a whopping 27% of Democrats won't, either. The number for indepedents is 19%.

Religiously, 23% of protestants wont, with 16% of Catholics and 22% of "non-Christians".

And here's the thing. It really is a liability. Mormons believe in some truly weird stuff, and they have a really bizarre history. Things the MSM will be happy to inform us of- AFTER Romney secures the nomination.

Secondly, beyond his religion, Romney has a lot of other problems. He made his money screwing working folks, a fact Obama will not neglect to remind people of. He's stiff and robotic and generally not likable. He occassionally says insentive things like "Corporations are people, too" and "I'll bet you $10,000." and my personal favorite, 'My sons working on my campaign is serving their country".

Now if you want to argue that he's stronger than the other six dwarves, you can argue that. I think Perry would be a stronger candidate if he can rise above the media character assassination of him. I think Gingrich would be a stronger candidate because he's smart and articulate. I think both men have been sandbagged by a GOP establishment that drank the koolaid on Romney.

 

you understand what Hesitant means? It means that wont rule it out. nice spin
on top of that, this is a fairly old poll and people change their minds when its the lesser of two evils.

That's not "proof." That's "conjecture."

 

No, it is proof. Proof does not have to be mathematically air-tight to be proof. It can be circumstantial and/or relay on obvious observations such as 'he who profits did it.'

 Proof | Define Proof at Dictionary.com 

 
1. evidence sufficient to establish a thing as true, or to produce belief in its truth.

2. anything serving as such evidence : What proof do you have?

3. the act of testing or making trial of anything; test; trial: to put a thing to the proof.

4. the establishment of the truth of anything; demonstration.

5. Law. (in judicial proceedings) evidence having probative weight.

 

 
And it's the main argument of the twoofers on why Bush and the oil companies were behind 9/11.

 

Bullshit. The terrorists were behind 9/11 and what the twofers provide is not what they think it is, as the biggest benificiary was not Bush and the Oil companies, but the Islamacist terroists.

How stupid can you be to think that out of SEVEN CANDIDATES running only TWO could manage to get on the ballot? Usually New York and other union dominated states are the ones hard to qualify for, but I have never heard of a state dissallowing such a huge percentage of the field IN ITS OWN PARTY.

This obviously rigged and you are a dumbass.

That is the stupidest summary of anything I have ever read. In 2008 I would have been happy with either Romney or Huckabee as McCain had a long running rep as a RINO sleazebag.

This election there were six decent choices and only one RINO who couldnt even get any serious attention and that was Huntsman. The GOP establishment is backing Romney because he is the least favorite of the conservative wing, he is spawn of an old eastern elite family and he has obviously cut deals and come to some understandings with some very powerful people.

If Romney won the country would have a much better PResident.

I simply hate the way the GOP establishment is shoving Romney down everyone elses throat, and shows such contempt for the democratic process.

Oh, maybe that is why you lefties are so comfortable with all this; that is how you wish your party was so you libtards could keep running things without the hassles of the more moderate groups like Hillaries.

You are a frigging retard.

Here is what Gingrich said:
 Gingrich, Perry fail to qualify for GOP primary ballot in Virginia - CNN.com 

 
On Wednesday, Gingrich assured a crowd of supporters he had met the threshold for appearing on the ballot, saying he had gathered anywhere from 12,000 to 14,000 signatures.

Virginia requires candidates to obtain 10,000 signatures from registered voters, with at least 400 signatures coming from each of the commonwealth's 11 congressional districts.

Gingrich's spokesman said Wednesday the effort to secure a spot on the Virginia ballot was meant to showcase the campaign's ground game.

"It's a demonstration that Gingrich is outrunning Romney in states beyond Iowa," said press secretary R.C. Hammond.

 

Hell, even Keyes got on the ballot back in 2008.

The difference is that the Virginia GOP changed the proscess this year:
 Virginia’s GOP Primary Ballot: Romney, Paul… And That’s It. - By Jim Geraghty - The Campaign Spot - National Review Online 

 
Those signature requirements, by the way, were 10,000 signatures including 500 in each of the state’s congressional districts. What apparently tripped up Gingrich and Perry was the requirement that petition signers list their addresses.

A Gingrich campaign official prior to the move by the RPV said the problem is how the rules are set up, arguing that the party is, for apparently the first time, cross-checking the addresses that signature-givers gave against the electronic voter database file for accuracies. A name without a proper address match was tossed, the official said.

“What one needs to ask is ‘what percentage of valid, registered voters self-identify a current address that matches voter rolls that the voter might not have updated since 2008”? Are you 100% certain that your address you and all of your neighbors matches current voter rolls? It strikes me that this is not an accurate means to identify registered voters signing for ANY candidate, not just Gingrich,” the official wrote.

 

But guess what? If you turned in a magic number of signatures, the state would not even validate ANY of the signatures you turned in:

 VA Ballot Access – No Way to Choose a President | RedState 

 
The Washington Examiner ran a gleeful hit piece Friday night quoting an anonymous “source with knowledge of the Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) petition signature verification process” who said Perry was “dead on arrival” and didn’t follow the “simple” rules required in VA...

The article also notes that the rules were sent to “all the Republican presidential campaigns” in March, but later admits that Perry’s campaign may not have received the detailed instructions because he didn’t enter the race until August.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch informs us that the Romney campaign had their petitions personally delivered by none other than Lt. Governor Bill Bolling, Romney’s VA campaign chairman....

The blog goes on to describe the process of gaining ballot access, which is likely the most burdensome in the country:

“A minimum of 10,000 petition signatures collected statewide, including at least 400 from each of its 11 congressional districts. That’s hard enough. But then there are the additional restrictions: The petition circulators must be registered or eligible to vote in Virginia. The signatures must be gathered using the State Board of Elections’ official form, a two-page document which must be reproduced as double-sided. (Single-sided stapled forms are not accepted.) Signatures must be collected on forms that are specific to each city, county and congressional district. Only “ qualified ” voters may sign a petition. And every single petition form must be sworn and notarized.”

The blogger claims to know top political consultants who turned town lucrative offers working on presidential campaigns because they thought the task could not be accomplished.

To make matters worse, the Republican Party of Virginia appears to have rigged the system in favor of candidates who were able to gather a comfortable excess of names on petitions. Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, Pat Mullins, issued the following (undated) directive:

“ Any candidate who submits at least 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions
statewide and has at least 600 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions from each of the 11 Congressional Districts shall be deemed to have met the threshold for qualification and will be certified (provided, of course, that other requirements of State law have also been met)”

“If any candidate submits fewer than 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions statewide or fewer than 600 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions in one or more of the 11 Congressional Districts, the Republican Party of Virginia will individually verify signatures until the 10,000 signature statewide threshold and/or 400 per Congressional district is met.”

In other words, if a candidate can gather 50% more signatures than actually required, the standard for those signatures is lower than for the signatures of candidates who gather 14,999 signatures or less. It appears that the Romney campaign, which boasted of gathering “some 16,000″ signatures was able to escape the scrutiny of having every signature individually verified.

 

But hey, libtard, I did some digging and guess what? The chairman for the ROmney campaign is also the Lt Govenor of Virginia!

 Virginia and Washington, DC endorsements of Mitt Romney 

 Bolling ties 2013 hopes to Romney - Washington Times 

Yeah, no conflict of interest there! Perry was not notified of the state requirements, too damn bad for him! Since he cant read Bollings mind thousands of miles away, he is obviously not qualified to run! And Gingriches signatures were not valid, obviously since he didnt stuff enough of them to get over a 15,000 count! Yerp, the more you cheat the less scrutiny you get in Virginia.

So stop talking crap about things you obviously are not informed on.But why would I ever expect some libtard to do that?
 
 
GOP Tea Party folks need to note who in the state, like lt Govenor Bolling are establishment toadies andd vote against them in the next election. Purge these anti-democracy jerks out of their party and build a strong base, state byt state, till they have an iron-clad grip on the state party structures.

And that all starts by noting who the low-lifes are and deliver payback when the time comes.

Romney's religion is his worst enemy. Mormons aren't Christians according to the religious right. Of course, he's the only candidate that has any chance.

 

It ain't Romney's religion that's going to sink him. He's already populating he's "cabinent" with ex-Bush PNAC'ers and talking about attacking Iran.

That..and just about every day he says something that is just golden for Democratic ads.

 

Given your prerogatives, then if by some miracle, Mr. Sallow, a Republican should win, who that is left would you like to see in the White HOuse? It sounds like you don't care for any war talk, regardless of the circumstances. Early this morning, I saw on television that a firm link between AlQaeda and Iran was established and announced by the Obama administration. It sounded like war talk coming from the left aisle. What's the deal?

 

The "connections" the US is asserting now..are just as tenuous as they asserted during the run up to war with Iraq. I seriously don't like this idea of mapping the entire government to an organization simply because somebody happens to be in or traveling through their terroritory. And I basically think it's the Saudis that are driving this...and are probably the real root of Al Qaeda.

Would would I "like" to see from the right in the White House? Jon Huntsman seems like a reasonable fellow as does Buddy Roemer. I could live with either one of those guys.

get real. None of them do what they promised. Our system is designed specifically so they won't keep most of their promises.

I think the problem that we have in 2012 is the same problem your party had in 2004. When a party holds the presidency for four years, it essentially sucks all the air out of the room, especially if they took a bath in the last midterm. You have to grow and develop a new generation of leaders.

Romney, Gingrich, Perry are pretty pathetic. But so were Edwards, Kerry and Dean in 2004. Had little to do with idealogy, it had more to do with the fact that any other major leader had whithered during a long presidency combined with a house keeping a change in party had.

The problem with the GOP here is that instead of going through the soul searching a party needs to go through about what it stands for (which is what the Democrats did in 2004 and 2006), you have an establishment that is trying to suppress any rebelling faction from increasing it's influence.

So if your "chosen" candidate is vanilla, dull, and uninspiring, you take everything else off the market.

And if Newt takes this to court, he will probably prevail. The problem here is that you have a GOP that is pretty much determined it's going to cheat to get it's weird Mormon Robot nominated, rather than consider why voters aren't going for it.

 

Takes it to court??

Wow. The stupid just grows.

Gingrich has... even fewer complimentary things said about him by people who worked with him in the 1990s.

 

Which only means that Gingrich managed to get things done in DC but ruffled some feathers doing it.

 

No, it means he's a fucking asshole whom nobody likes.

 

Which is why he's been leading the polls, since no one likes him?

Oh, wait, you mean no one who counts (GOP bluebloods) likes him.

Sounds like more reason to vote for Newt.

You asswipes do realize that this is going to cement a lot of votres for Paul as simply the FU vote to the establishment? Right? I know several Perry voters who have said that they will vote anyone but Romney now, and I have seen it on multiple message boards. This will reverbate against Romney across the nation and if he gets the nomination despite the preference of 75% of the GOP for someone else, then the GOP will make the political pressures for a new party overwhelming.

If Romney gets it a third party effort will be huge this time. The GOP and Dems will have to jack the poll numbers from 15% to 30% to keep a third party out this year, lol.
 
 
 
You're a fucking idiot. Bachman, Huntsman and Santorum didn't get enough signatures. Newt paid $1.50 per signature, got over 11,000, but many were not legitimate. That's why you have to get about twice as many signatures as needed in order to make sure you have enough legitimate ones. Which Mittens and Paul did.

 

Its 50% above the minimum, dumbass, not 100%

 
You would think, as 'smart' as Newt claims to be, he would take the needed steps to get on the ballot in his own adopted state!  

 

And as smart as you seem to think you are, you might consider paying to get 11,000+signatures 'taking a step'. lololl

Your distorted view of the world explains much if you are typical for the GOP neocons or Dem libtards these days.
 
 
 
How in the hell did Gingrich allow this to happen? I highly doubt he couldn't find 10K signatures in the state of VA.

What a blunder.

Perry on the other hand, probably couldn't find 10K signatures in VA.

 

The both had more than 10k, but Bolling and his cronies in the VA GOP machine simply tossed out enough to keep them off the ballot.

Keyes got enough in 2008 and wasnt considered a major candidate, so the GOP changed the rules this year so they could legally throw out as many signatures as they want.

But whatever happened to your respect for the voters? You really think that these ridiculous rules were meant to enable the choices for Virginian voters?

Of course not, it wasmeant to hand the state over to Romney, but he might get a huge surprise in March.
 
 
 
The simple fact is that to run for President you need to lay the groundwork in advance, build a network of individuals to go out and get signatures in each state where it is necessary. Everybody but Paul and Romney blew it in Virginia and this has to be a warning shot for all the others that they had best make sure they get on the states ballots that are left. Everybody knew the rules so there is no excuse. I take that back, it appears that some do not know the rules.

 
Voters deserve the right to vote for any top contender, especially leading candidates, Michael Krull, Gingrichs campaign director, said in a statement. We will work with the Republican Party of Virginia to pursue an aggressive write-in campaign to make sure that all the voters of Virginia are able to vote for the candidate of their choice.
Virginia law, however, says that no write-in shall be permitted on ballots in primary elections. The state partys decision is a setback for Gingrich and may benefit Romney as it underscores the campaign organization needed for a run for the White House.

 

 Gingrich, Perry Fail to Make Virginia Primary - Bloomberg 

 

Its not the rules that are the problem but who enforces the rules, in this case the chairman of Romneys campaign in VA enforces the rules and no one qualifies but him and the most extreme candidate left. And you think that is how things are supposed to work?

lolol

So they only people the REPUBLICAN Party lets on the ballot are Mitt and the Crazy Guy, and you don't smell a fix? Really?

I hear Mitt Romney is going to hire Tonya Harding as his campaign director. Expect a lot of broken kneecaps in the next few weeks.

 

No. Virginia has the strictest ballot access requirements in the nation. Every candidate is aware of this, or should be.

 

No, they just changed the rules this year, duh.
 
 
 
 
 
Romney's religion is his worst enemy. Mormons aren't Christians according to the religious right. Of course, he's the only candidate that has any chance.

 

Well, a couple things on that. First, you are assuming that hostility towards Mormonism is the exclusive domain of the "Religious Right". It isn't. Gallup took a poll that says that 22% of the population won't vote for a Mormon. Which, by the way, should be a good enough reason for EVERY Republican to do a double take about this guy.

 In U.S., 22% Are Hesitant to Support a Mormon in 2012 

BUt if you go into the numbers, 18% of Republicans won't support a Mormon, but a whopping 27% of Democrats won't, either. The number for indepedents is 19%.

Religiously, 23% of protestants wont, with 16% of Catholics and 22% of "non-Christians".

And here's the thing. It really is a liability. Mormons believe in some truly weird stuff, and they have a really bizarre history. Things the MSM will be happy to inform us of- AFTER Romney secures the nomination.

Secondly, beyond his religion, Romney has a lot of other problems. He made his money screwing working folks, a fact Obama will not neglect to remind people of. He's stiff and robotic and generally not likable. He occassionally says insentive things like "Corporations are people, too" and "I'll bet you $10,000." and my personal favorite, 'My sons working on my campaign is serving their country".

Now if you want to argue that he's stronger than the other six dwarves, you can argue that. I think Perry would be a stronger candidate if he can rise above the media character assassination of him. I think Gingrich would be a stronger candidate because he's smart and articulate. I think both men have been sandbagged by a GOP establishment that drank the koolaid on Romney.

 

you understand what Hesitant means? It means that wont rule it out. nice spin
on top of that, this is a fairly old poll and people change their minds when its the lesser of two evils.

 

It doesnt matter as Romney will not win the general election, not so much because of who he is, Mormon or whatever, but because too many people are getting sick to death of GOP establsihment bullshit like this.

Right now I will vote for ANYONE, Obama, Paul, Trump, Rosie O'Donnel, but I will not vote for anyone that the GOP establishment is behind.

They can ESAD.

Dude, supporting the GOP as it bends and breaks anyrules and laws it wants to to get their annointed one on the ballot and keep all but one rival off, that is not corruption?

Yes, the whole process runs on corruption in one form or another, and most of it is far more subtle.

All you can really do these days is draw the line at how blatant the corruption can be that you are willing to ignore.

This VA ballot crosses the line as it isnt just corrupt but takes valid choices from the GOP voters and is blatantly anti-democratic.

For Christ's sake why not just have these assholes just annoint their pick 12 months before the general election and let everyone stuff it if they dont like it? Oh, because then they would have no chance inthe general election as real Americans prefer a democratic process, not this corrupt bullshit the GOP is pushing on everyone now.

The Tea Party Movement is the best chance Americans have today of taking control of Washington DC from the cronyism and coruption feeding off our tax dollars.

The GOP element that thrives on this corruption is desperate to use Romney to stop the TPM in its tracks and this is just the latest act of desperation with more and worse still to come.

There you go again with the stupid, listening to Gingrich.

This isn't something up for debate, fuckwit. The number of signatures delivered is a fixed & known number. It was 11,050.

Gingrich failed. Man enough up and accept it.
 
 
 
 
 
That's a pile of shit.

Gingrichs' camp only served up 11,050 signatures - ACCORDING TO THE GINGRICH CAMP.

Not enough. He fucked up. Big time.

The dude is so inept he didn't even know HIS OWN STATE of residency doesn't allow primary write-in signatures.

Stop pulling numbers out of your ass and stop blaming others for Fig Newton's failures.

 

You are a frigging retard.

You will lose every time.

 

That is hilarious. You have been wrong twice already in this thread, so that arrogant claim you just made would make it three times. Maybe this thought you have that you define what is truthful within that peanut brainstem you have is what keeps you from learning. Guess you figure it makes no sense to read anything when you can just make it up and WALLAH! reality then bends upon itself and immediately what you say is then true.

lolol

 
Meanwhile, you will continue to be a blithering blame machine of spectacular proportions.

Listen up Douche: Fig Newton handed in 11,050 Ballots.

NOT 12,000 to 14,000. Your problem is: You listen to Newt.

 

And you quoted a different number released by his camp that came a day or so later, big frigging deal. He turned in enough to qualify as long as the invalidations were no more than the typical 10% or so.

But Bolling and his cronies changed the rules and failed to notify PErry's camp apparently as they sent the notices out to the candidate prior to PErry's announcement.

But you couldnt give a fig as you are going to support the GOP no matter who they pick or why.

YOU AND YOUR DIMWITTED KIND ARE WHY OUR NATION IS SO SCREWED UP RIGHT NOW.

And your going to hand another four years to Obama. lol congratulations, dumbshit.

 
That's the first indication to readers of your shit how deluded you are.

Now, I'll put it in Whack-job right wing Newsmax media presentation terms, so you can grasp the nuances of words that escape you - like OOOOOPPPPS!

 

So now you resort to bald-faced lies. I did not quote Newsmax, you pathetic liar.

 
 
According to the Virginia state board of elections, Gingrich made the ballot with 11,050 signatures, which is short of the 12,000 to 13,000 he said he had at an event in Arlington, Va. on Wednesday night.

 

 Gingrich Makes Virginia Ballot; Others Miss Out 

 

 

Yeah, I guess Lt GOv Bolling who is Romney campaignchairman in VA is really giving Romney and his leash-holders all their money's worth.

But I am feeling its going to cost them more in negative publicity than anything they will get from aprimary as late as March, and they will get nothing for it if Gingrich gets the decision reversed.

"Someday, in the future, I will create fawning easily-led republican soldiers who will believe all I say and on connected computers I will teach them to give me rhetorical blowjobs."
 
 
Virginia requires candidates to obtain 10,000 signatures from registered voters, with at least 400 signatures coming from each of the commonwealth's 11 congressional districts. Prior to this year, these numbers were not hard to hit.

Hell, even Keyes got on the ballot back in 2008.

The difference is that the Virginia GOP changed the process this year:
 Virginias GOP Primary Ballot: Romney, Paul And Thats It. - By Jim Geraghty - The Campaign Spot - National Review Online 

 
Those signature requirements, by the way, were 10,000 signatures including 500 in each of the states congressional districts. What apparently tripped up Gingrich and Perry was the requirement that petition signers list their addresses.

A Gingrich campaign official prior to the move by the RPV said the problem is how the rules are set up, arguing that the party is, for apparently the first time, cross-checking the addresses that signature-givers gave against the electronic voter database file for accuracies. A name without a proper address match was tossed, the official said.

What one needs to ask is what percentage of valid, registered voters self-identify a current address that matches voter rolls that the voter might not have updated since 2008? Are you 100% certain that your address you and all of your neighbors matches current voter rolls? It strikes me that this is not an accurate means to identify registered voters signing for ANY candidate, not just Gingrich, the official wrote.

 

But guess what? If you turned in a magic number of signatures, the state would not even validate ANY of the signatures you turned in:

 VA Ballot Access  No Way to Choose a President | RedState 

 
The Washington Examiner ran a gleeful hit piece Friday night quoting an anonymous source with knowledge of the Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) petition signature verification process who said Perry was dead on arrival and didnt follow the simple rules required in VA...

The article also notes that the rules were sent to all the Republican presidential campaigns in March, but later admits that Perrys campaign may not have received the detailed instructions because he didnt enter the race until August.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch informs us that the Romney campaign had their petitions personally delivered by none other than Lt. Governor Bill Bolling, Romneys VA campaign chairman....

The blog goes on to describe the process of gaining ballot access, which is likely the most burdensome in the country:

A minimum of 10,000 petition signatures collected statewide, including at least 400 from each of its 11 congressional districts. Thats hard enough. But then there are the additional restrictions: The petition circulators must be registered or eligible to vote in Virginia. The signatures must be gathered using the State Board of Elections official form, a two-page document which must be reproduced as double-sided. (Single-sided stapled forms are not accepted.) Signatures must be collected on forms that are specific to each city, county and congressional district. Only  qualified  voters may sign a petition. And every single petition form must be sworn and notarized.

The blogger claims to know top political consultants who turned town lucrative offers working on presidential campaigns because they thought the task could not be accomplished.

To make matters worse, the Republican Party of Virginia appears to have rigged the system in favor of candidates who were able to gather a comfortable excess of names on petitions. Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, Pat Mullins, issued the following (undated) directive:

 Any candidate who submits at least 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions
statewide and has at least 600 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions from each of the 11 Congressional Districts shall be deemed to have met the threshold for qualification and will be certified (provided, of course, that other requirements of State law have also been met)

If any candidate submits fewer than 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions statewide or fewer than 600 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions in one or more of the 11 Congressional Districts, the Republican Party of Virginia will individually verify signatures until the 10,000 signature statewide threshold and/or 400 per Congressional district is met.

In other words, if a candidate can gather 50% more signatures than actually required, the standard for those signatures is lower than for the signatures of candidates who gather 14,999 signatures or less. It appears that the Romney campaign, which boasted of gathering some 16,000″ signatures was able to escape the scrutiny of having every signature individually verified.

 

The chairman for the Romney campaign is also the Lt Govenor of Virginia!

 Bolling ties 2013 hopes to Romney - Washington Times 

Yeah, no conflict of interest there! Perry was not notified of the state requirements, too damn bad for him! Since he cant read Bollings mind thousands of miles away, he is obviously not qualified to run! And Gingriches signatures were not valid, obviously since he didnt stuff enough of them to get over a 15,000 count! Yerp, the more you cheat the less scrutiny you get in Virginia.

The GOP establishment has totally destroyed one Tea PArty candidate after another: Palin, Bachman, Perry, Cain, Gingrich is sinking and the guns starting on Ron Paul now, whom the establishment apparently thinks is too extreme to really challenge Romney.

They have a surprise coming. They are alienatingmore voters than votes they can steal, and even if Romney wins the nomination, he will definately to lose to Obama because the GOP base, the social conservatives, are sick of the dirty tricks, the slander, and the cronyism of the GOP establishment. After Obama wins re-election the social conservative and Tea PArty groups will get more funding than the GOP establishment ever dreamed of. They may try to go back and fight the rigged game the GOP has now, but my bet is that they will split off and form a new party.

It worked in Canada and there is no reason to believe it canot work in the USA.

Which of them are not?

These days our choices are for the lesser of two criminals and so far the Dems have not blatantly rigged a primary like this anywhere I have seen. Hell even the Chicago Daley machine doesnt kick almost all of the candidates off the ballot.

Todays GOP establishment is no more criminal than the Dems, but this primary ballot for VA shows that they *are* more willing to openly censor the democratic process itself.

That is more dangerous for our Republic than the run-of -the-mill Tammany Hall typoe criminal machine.

This tells you how smart the 'smartest man in the room' is.

After belting loose on the "Failed System" in his own state after HIS incompetency, he said this:

"Voters deserve the right to vote for any top contender, especially leading candidates," Gingrich campaign director Michael Krull said in a statement. " We will work with the Republican Party of Virginia to pursue an aggressive write-in campaign to make sure that all the voters of Virginia are able to vote for the candidate of their choice."

Cept Newt DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE IS NO WRITE OPTION!
In his own state.

"However, state law says this about primary write-in campaigns: " No write-in shall be permitted on ballots in primary elections."

" Virginia code prohibits write-ins in primaries. He can't do it," said Carl Tobias, a law professor at University of Richmond."

Thank you & Merry Christmas, Newton, Fig.
 
 
Virginia requires candidates to obtain 10,000 signatures from registered voters, with at least 400 signatures coming from each of the commonwealth's 11 congressional districts. Prior to this year, these numbers were not hard to hit.

Hell, even Keyes got on the ballot back in 2008.

The difference is that the Virginia GOP changed the process this year:
 Virginia’s GOP Primary Ballot: Romney, Paul… And That’s It. - By Jim Geraghty - The Campaign Spot - National Review Online 

 
Those signature requirements, by the way, were 10,000 signatures including 500 in each of the state’s congressional districts. What apparently tripped up Gingrich and Perry was the requirement that petition signers list their addresses.

A Gingrich campaign official prior to the move by the RPV said the problem is how the rules are set up, arguing that the party is, for apparently the first time, cross-checking the addresses that signature-givers gave against the electronic voter database file for accuracies. A name without a proper address match was tossed, the official said.

“What one needs to ask is ‘what percentage of valid, registered voters self-identify a current address that matches voter rolls that the voter might not have updated since 2008”? Are you 100% certain that your address you and all of your neighbors matches current voter rolls? It strikes me that this is not an accurate means to identify registered voters signing for ANY candidate, not just Gingrich,” the official wrote.

 

But guess what? If you turned in a magic number of signatures, the state would not even validate ANY of the signatures you turned in:

 VA Ballot Access – No Way to Choose a President | RedState 

 
The Washington Examiner ran a gleeful hit piece Friday night quoting an anonymous “source with knowledge of the Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) petition signature verification process” who said Perry was “dead on arrival” and didn’t follow the “simple” rules required in VA...

The article also notes that the rules were sent to “all the Republican presidential campaigns” in March, but later admits that Perry’s campaign may not have received the detailed instructions because he didn’t enter the race until August.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch informs us that the Romney campaign had their petitions personally delivered by none other than Lt. Governor Bill Bolling, Romney’s VA campaign chairman....

The blog goes on to describe the process of gaining ballot access, which is likely the most burdensome in the country:

“A minimum of 10,000 petition signatures collected statewide, including at least 400 from each of its 11 congressional districts. That’s hard enough. But then there are the additional restrictions: The petition circulators must be registered or eligible to vote in Virginia. The signatures must be gathered using the State Board of Elections’ official form, a two-page document which must be reproduced as double-sided. (Single-sided stapled forms are not accepted.) Signatures must be collected on forms that are specific to each city, county and congressional district. Only “ qualified ” voters may sign a petition. And every single petition form must be sworn and notarized.”

The blogger claims to know top political consultants who turned town lucrative offers working on presidential campaigns because they thought the task could not be accomplished.

To make matters worse, the Republican Party of Virginia appears to have rigged the system in favor of candidates who were able to gather a comfortable excess of names on petitions. Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, Pat Mullins, issued the following (undated) directive:

“ Any candidate who submits at least 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions
statewide and has at least 600 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions from each of the 11 Congressional Districts shall be deemed to have met the threshold for qualification and will be certified (provided, of course, that other requirements of State law have also been met)”

“If any candidate submits fewer than 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions statewide or fewer than 600 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions in one or more of the 11 Congressional Districts, the Republican Party of Virginia will individually verify signatures until the 10,000 signature statewide threshold and/or 400 per Congressional district is met.”

In other words, if a candidate can gather 50% more signatures than actually required, the standard for those signatures is lower than for the signatures of candidates who gather 14,999 signatures or less. It appears that the Romney campaign, which boasted of gathering “some 16,000″ signatures was able to escape the scrutiny of having every signature individually verified.

 

The chairman for the Romney campaign is also the Lt Govenor of Virginia!

 Bolling ties 2013 hopes to Romney - Washington Times 

Yeah, no conflict of interest there! Perry was not notified of the state requirements, too damn bad for him! Since he cant read Bollings mind thousands of miles away, he is obviously not qualified to run! And Gingriches signatures were not valid, obviously since he didnt stuff enough of them to get over a 15,000 count! Yerp, the more you cheat the less scrutiny you get in Virginia.

The GOP establishment has totally destroyed one Tea PArty candidate after another: Palin, Bachman, Perry, Cain, Gingrich is sinking and the guns starting on Ron Paul now, whom the establishment apparently thinks is too extreme to really challenge Romney.

They have a surprise coming. They are alienatingmore voters than votes they can steal, and even if Romney wins the nomination, he will definately to lose to Obama because the GOP base, the social conservatives, are sick of the dirty tricks, the slander, and the cronyism of the GOP establishment. After Obama wins re-election the social conservative and Tea PArty groups will get more funding than the GOP establishment ever dreamed of. They may try to go back and fight the rigged game the GOP has now, but my bet is that they will split off and form a new party.

It worked in Canada and there is no reason to believe it cannot work in the USA.

Thank you & Merry Christmas, Newton, Fig.

 

Oh, bullshit, you think ROMNEY knows all the laws for qualifying for every state in the US?

Of course not. That is why he hires pros to run this kind of thing for him.

Newts rise in the last month or so has made a time crunch for him as his campaign expands and he makes his best effort with the people he has lately been able to hire.

All of which, once again, proves that you are a lying twat.

So, Cain, the magical mystery 9.99 Pizza Man came fluttering anew into their fragile, still-broken hearts. Wallets of cash opened once again. Surely, he would be the nominee, Shirley! Then the grope-a-dope came a crashing.

They didnt fail at anything, dumbass. Gingrich had between 12,000 to 14,000 signatures and all he needed were 10,000. Typically you lose about 10% from improper signatures, so Gingrich should have made it easily, but GOP establishment toadies simply tossed enough to deny Gingrich a place on the ballot.

How stupid can you be to think that out of SEVEN CANDIDATES running only TWO could manage to get on the ballot? Usually New York and other union dominated states are the ones hard to qualify for, but I have never heard of a state dissallowing such a huge percentage of the field IN ITS OWN PARTY.

This obviously rigged and you are a dumbass.

 

This has already been explained in this thread, in post #50 and #59. If you don't even bother reading other people's posts, you're no longer worth responding to.

That is the stupidest summary of anything I have ever read. In 2008 I would have been happy with either Romney or Huckabee as McCain had a long running rep as a RINO sleazebag.

This election there were six decent choices and only one RINO who couldnt even get any serious attention and that was Huntsman. The GOP establishment is backing Romney because he is the least favorite of the conservative wing, he is spawn of an old eastern elite family and he has obviously cut deals and come to some understandings with some very powerful people.

If Romney won the country would have a much better PResident.

I simply hate the way the GOP establishment is shoving Romney down everyone elses throat, and shows such contempt for the democratic process.

Oh, maybe that is why you lefties are so comfortable with all this; that is how you wish your party was so you libtards could keep running things without the hassles of the more moderate groups like Hillaries.

 

You are one dumb motherfucker. Huntsman has the most conservative record of any of the candidates.
 
 
 
Perhaps not, but being a candidate for president should.

Frankly, this is embarrassing.

 

True.

Its as if Gingrichs sudden rise in the polls surprised even Gingrich, who wasnt taking himself seriously. As already noted, Gingrich seems to lack the Nation-wide organization needed to run a serious campaign for president, this blunder is evidence of that.

And it isnt so they can repeat things that candidates should already know.

Your statement is ridiculous, these campaigns were warned on November 15th by the GOP in Virginia to get busy and get those signatures, they also recommended that they go well over the recommended 10,000 and the 400 from each of the 11 congressional districts, as many people will sign a petition and not even be registered to vote, they were thoroughly warned and they dropped the ball. Newt has lived in that state for the last 12 years and he was the heavy favorite to carry it, he again has torpeoded his own boat. They need to stop the whining, they did this to themselves. Ron Paul and Mitt Romney got it done, they were organized and they organized their volunteers the rest did not.

I know you little party establishment shills think you have explained it by repeating the legalities like some sheister lawyer.

That does not explain the obvious corruption and the rigging of the democratic process where the chairman of one candidate has his people in the government disqualify major rivals on the basis of mispelled street names, failure to change their address with the voter registration database, etc. The sheer embarrassment this Bolling asswipe is bringing to the state of Virginia will live on for years if not decades.

And that you cant see what the problem is demonstrates how ignorant, amoral, and degenerate our political process has become. Son it wont have any democratic legitimacy at all and will increasingly resemble the EU; rule by unelected technocrats and crooks.

Way to go doofus.

Romney is the only one capable of beating Barach Obama and for that reason and that alone he has my support, BTW, he is a fiscal conservative, you might try reading his record and his book, I have done both and am very, very comfortable with Romney as President of the U.S. He has gotten a bad rap, from some of the lunatics, in 08 Romney was the darling of conservatives, since Obama care and the "mandate" he has been thrown under the bus by the likes of Rush Limbaugh who was in total support of Mitt in 08. The ONLY comparison on the health care plans is the mandate and quite frankly I am pro mandate as I am sick and tired of paying for other people's healthcare with rising health care costs, higher premiums and higher taxes. I am pro-personal responsibility and if it takes a state mandate to get it done, then I am all for it.

You seem to not consider at all the fact that untill Gingrich rose to the top in thepolls he didnt have much money and couldnt afford the expense of initiating the process of getting on the ballot for the Virginia primary which isnt even h eld till March.

You are also, for some reason, ignoring the obvious conflict of interest here where the chairman for Romnuts campaign is also the lt Govenor, then ooops only two of seven candidates qualify for the VA ballot and it only just so happens one of them is his candidate.

If you cant see the corruption in this situation there is no remedy for it via fact or reason.

If you are running for President of the United States you better damn well know the election laws of the different states or at least hire a campaign manager who does. These candidates were warned on November 15th from the GOP in Virginia to get busy, they didn't, quit making excuses for them. They deserve to lose those electoral votes, they did not earn them.
 
 
This is hilarious.

Gingrich epically fails and the spin from the right is that the GOP establishment is cheating.

You guys look like a bunch of buffoons!

I'm thinking, again, I'll be right.

 
 
 
 
Your statement is ridiculous, these campaigns were warned on November 15th by the GOP in Virginia to get busy and get those signatures,

 

Rick Perry was not notified as he only declared in August and the warnings you refer to went out in April or so.

 
they also recommended that they go well over the recommended 10,000 and the 400 from each of the 11 congressional districts, as many people will sign a petition and not even be registered to vote, they were thoroughly warned and they dropped the ball.

 

But that isnt the problem. The problem is how the registration signatures were validated using a very tight process that eliminates people who can vote but who have minor differences in their voter registration data. This is the first time the state has been this anal, and it is not accident that Bolling is the chairman of Romnuts campaign in VA.

 
Newt has lived in that state for the last 12 years and he was the heavy favorite to carry it, he again has torpeoded his own boat. They need to stop the whining, they did this to themselves. Ron Paul and Mitt Romney got it done, they were organized and they organized their volunteers the rest did not.

 

And you should really ask yourself if you think a primary that is set up so that only two of seven major candidates qualify is a service to the Virginia GOP voters or is it a convenience for the GOP establishment.

The answer should be obvious. And to say that Perry and Gingrich did not organize is absurd,please.

That is a myth. You dont know that, no one can know that. And it doesnt justify bumping five of seven candidates from the ballot.

 
...BTW, he is a fiscal conservative, you might try reading his record and his book, I have done both and am very, very comfortable with Romney as President of the U.S.

 

I dont doubt that Romnuts is an economic conservative, but I want a full fledged conservative, one who is conservative on social and security issues as well.

I had considered Romuts my fourth choice for President behind PAul, Perry and Gingrich untill this Virginia fiasco took place. This proves that Romnnuts is bought and paid for by the GOP establishment and who knows what deals he has struck with those evil bastards.

That makes me completely disgusted with the way he is running for the party nomination. After this weekend I will vote for the goddamned anti-Christ before I vote for Romnuts.

No one that has any respect for the voters right to choose can rest easy with what happened with the Virginia primary. Some group who has nothing but complete contempt for democracy is behind him now and that is far worse than anything Obama might ever do.
 
 
 
If the spin is that the GOP is fixing their own intra-party elections, how can they be trusted to be fair players when they are running against the people they really hate?

 

They cant be trusted, and that is the point.

If they will use rule technicalities to disqualify five of seven candidates, then what respect can they possibly have for the voters of this nation?

Answer: none at all.

Personally, I would rather have four more years of Obama than a bunch of closet fascists behind Romnuts in the White House.
 
 
 
Looks like Romney will win Virginia's Primary, so he can focus on other Super Tuesday states. It is beginning to look like Romney will be the main man for Republicans because of his steady base of support.

 
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has failed to qualify for Virginia's March 6 Republican primary, a development that adds to the challenges faced by the recent frontrunner in the GOP presidential race.
"After verification, RPV has determined that Newt Gingrich did not submit required 10k signatures and has not qualified for the VA primary," the Republican Party of Virginia announced early Saturday on its Twitter website.
Perry also fell short of the 10,000 signatures of registered voters required for a candidate's name to be on the primary ballot, but former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Rep. Ron Paul will be on the ballot.

 

 My Way News - GOP: Gingrich, Perry will not be on Va. Ballot 

 

We're down to a Virginia ballot that will consist of Romney and possibly Ron Paul if he doesn't get disqualified too. All other GOP candidates failed to meet Virginia's requirements.

 
Republican presidential candidates Michele Bachmann, Jon Huntsman and Rick Santorum failed to qualify for the Virginia ballot, according to state GOP officials.

Four candidates  former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Ron Paul (Texas)  turned in thousands of signatures by the deadline.

Candidates had until 5 p.m. to collect 10,000 signatures from across the state, including 400 from each congressional district.

Virginia, an increasingly important swing state, will hold its primary on Super Tuesday, March

The signatures still must be certified by Republican Party of Virginia. Garren Shipley, a party spokesman, said he expects that to be completed by Friday.

If the spin is that the GOP is fixing their own intra-party elections, how can they be trusted to be fair players when they are running against the people they really hate?

 

They cant be trusted, and that is the point.

If they will use rule technicalities to disqualify five of seven candidates, then what respect can they possibly have for the voters of this nation?

Answer: none at all.

Personally, I would rather have four more years of Obama than a bunch of closet fascists behind Romnuts in the White House.

 

In this we agree.

The number one reason why I am voting for Obama is to avoid giving them a controlled government. They scare the shit out of me.

 

You all need to work with your GOP in your own states. First of all these candidates knew full well the election laws of Virginia, they were warned by the GOP in Virginia on the 15th of November to get busy or else. They did not comply.

The GOP is not and can not be responsible for collecting signatures for individual candidates, that is the entire responsibility of the Candidate's committee, the managers of the candidate and all of their volunteers. It is absolutely against the laws of any GOP at the state level to get involved with the individual candidates during the primary season, they can not show favor of any kind. It is the responsibility of the candidate to get on the ballot and to know the different state laws in order to do that and respond with an organization in place to make sure the candidate complies with that state's election laws through their state managers and all the volunteers under that state manager.

You all need to quit whining, they knew the laws and were fully aware of them,Virginia has had these election laws in place for many elections, this was no surprise to them. They failed to act and have an organization in place to respond to the requirements of Virginia election law. They torpeoded their own boats.
 
 
 
Newt knew MONTHS in advance of the requirements.

And STILL, he could not collect a measy 15,000 signatures. What the hell does that tell you?

 

1. He’s not serious about being president.
2. He lacks the resources to run a Nation-wide campaign.
3. If somehow nominated, he’d stand no chance against Obama.

Not only did he know months in advance he and the other candidates were warned about this on November 15th by the Virginia GOP to get busy or else don't be included on the ballot. What's really embarrassing for Newt is that he has lived in Virginia for the last 12 years and was the heavy favorite in that State, talk about giving it away.

He is not a serious contender, not if you can't make it on the ballot in the state you reside in, where you are heavily favored. Really embarrassing, he did not have his volunteers out there collecting those signatures, that's what this boils down to, they did not do their job. Some of the lunies on the board are trying to make this out to be some conspiracy, ridiculous.
 
 
 
 
How in the hell did Gingrich allow this to happen? I highly doubt he couldn't find 10K signatures in the state of VA.

What a blunder.

Perry on the other hand, probably couldn't find 10K signatures in VA.

 

The both had more than 10k, but Bolling and his cronies in the VA GOP machine simply tossed out enough to keep them off the ballot.

Keyes got enough in 2008 and wasnt considered a major candidate, so the GOP changed the rules this year so they could legally throw out as many signatures as they want.

But whatever happened to your respect for the voters? You really think that these ridiculous rules were meant to enable the choices for Virginian voters?

Of course not, it wasmeant to hand the state over to Romney, but he might get a huge surprise in March.

 

OK, Braniac: how many signatures did Keyes collect in 2008?

He collected more than enough signatures, but Romney's goons cheated.

This is going to seriously backfire on Romney... I think that the more they see the establishment cheat to get their pre-determined result, the more you are going to see the base rebel against it.

Probably means Obama will get a second term, and people will curse Romney's name for blowing it.
 
 
 
 
 
Perhaps not, but being a candidate for president should.

 

You really think Romnuts knows all the rules for primaries across the country?

 
Frankly, this is embarrassing.

 

For the GOP, yes, it certainly is. Bolling has proven what a sellout little whore he is.

The TPM should have his ass in the crosshairs till he leaves elected office.

 

If you are running for President of the United States you better damn well know the election laws of the different states or at least hire a campaign manager who does. These candidates were warned on November 15th from the GOP in Virginia to get busy, they didn't, quit making excuses for them. They deserve to lose those electoral votes, they did not earn them.

 

Guy, "election laws" have nothing to do with it. This was a call made by the Republican Party of Virginia, not the State of Virginia.

And seriously, invalidating 5 of the 7 candidates? Wasn't that going a bit overboard? How little faith does the Establishment have in Romney.
 
 
Funny how the liberals and the Romney toadies are on the same side on this one?

Of course he would stand a chance, but the more the GOP establishment ruins the Republican brand (as if Boner and Rmnuts has done enough already) then it will be much hard for any GOP nominee to win.

I do too, because I know *I* am sick of his bullshit already and we havent even had a single primary yet.

This is standard NE machine politics; attack, slander, ruin and bouy off.

Romneys destruction of government documents in the last days of his govenor ship is a ticking time bomb here that Obama will bang like a cheap whore.

Agreed. Romnuts might get Virginia but methinks he has dug himself a hole to deep to climb out of in most states.

What does anyone think Romnuts credibility is with the TPM now? Zilch. And that I suspect will almost guarrantee he doesnt get the nomination. But who knows? Romnuts seems intent on buying every TPM loser out there who desperately dreams of having cred again some day.

Gingrich failed to get on the Missouri Primary ballot too. Of course the Republican party in Missouri has decided to apportion delegates in a caucus and the primary is beauty contest to avoid penalties for moving the primary up without party approval.

But these people did file to be on the ballot:
U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann
Herman Cain
Keith Drummond
John Huntsman
Gov. Gary Johnson
Michael Meehan
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas
Gov. Rick Perry
Gov. Mitt Romney
U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania

Showing that Gingrich must not be serious in his bid.

Looks like Romney will win Virginia's Primary, so he can focus on other Super Tuesday states. It is beginning to look like Romney will be the main man for Republicans because of his steady base of support.

 
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has failed to qualify for Virginia's March 6 Republican primary, a development that adds to the challenges faced by the recent frontrunner in the GOP presidential race.
"After verification, RPV has determined that Newt Gingrich did not submit required 10k signatures and has not qualified for the VA primary," the Republican Party of Virginia announced early Saturday on its Twitter website.
Perry also fell short of the 10,000 signatures of registered voters required for a candidate's name to be on the primary ballot, but former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Rep. Ron Paul will be on the ballot.

 

 My Way News - GOP: Gingrich, Perry will not be on Va. Ballot 

 

This is shows a stunning lack of organization for supposed front runners in this primary. I have become increasingly disillusioned with the GOP primary. At the onset I was a stanch Paul supporter, motivated by the thought that Obama was infinitely beatable and that what was desperately needed was a candidate that would follow through on commitments to restore the Constitutional restrictions on a forever expanding federal government and unregulated central banking system.

Ron Paul will not defeat Obama. It will not be based on policy or philosophical differences, Paul vs. Obama would be portrayed as a white racist attack on the first black president.

Paul is not capable of adequately articulating his libertarian positions effectively nor will he resonate personally to a majority of Americans.

Looking at the field now I am more depressed and truly concerned for the future of this country. There isn't a candidate that I believe can both defeat Obama and actually dramatically reform the federal government.

Then youre both depressed and naïve  this was the case before the 2012 campaign even began. There was never a candidate who could dramatically reform the federal government, nor will there ever be. That can only be done by the American people through the vote  if they ever wise-up and use the franchise as designed. This search for the Messiah President is inane.

13 pages and I haven't seen anyone mention what this does to the Iowa caucaus. Folks in Iowa tend to worry about that fuzzy idea called "electability.". A headline like this probably killed Newt's chances there dead.

I'm not sold on the idea of a fix by the GOP. This isn't the first time Newt's shown some serious organizational issues and keeping most of the candidates off the ballot renders Virginia irrelevant in the primary process.
 
 
Its a conspiracy on a level with the missing plane and collapse of building 7. It makes the Roswell weather balloon look like a game of clue. This is bigger and deeper than the men on the grassy knoll. There are men behind the curtains and it is being hushed up at the highest levels! This could be the work of the Bilderbergers, and the people in the Bohemian Grove!
This could possibly be the combined work of the Soros and Kochs.
Keep your eyes and ears open, 'Merkun 'mockracy is at stake!

Or Ginreich's campaign blew it.

I'm going to go with Occam's Razor and blame ineptitude. I mean, Rick Perry doesn't even know what the voting age is. I'm not at all surprised that his campaign would be baffled by election laws and rules.
 
 
 
BUt if you go into the numbers, 18% of Republicans won't support a Mormon, but a whopping 27% of Democrats won't, either. The number for indepedents is 19%

 

Of those Democrats and Independents, how many of them are equally unwilling to support ANY candidate who presents a significant religious affiliation? I suspect that Democrats and Independents are less concerned with a Mormon candidate than they are with a religious candidate.

It has no bearing on Iowa except for maybe public indifference to Gingrich's campaign. Another aspect is that we are talking about a minuscule amount of delegates but the media's magnifying glass effect on little states magnifies their influence. Why the parties let a few states select their nominee is beyond comprehension. Talk about the tail wagging the dog!!!!

This does open the door somewhat to a Dark horse candidate coming into the race. Even though deadlines have passed for some primaries and others are approaching quickly, several others are caucuses and they usually do not have strict rules for nominations.

Romney has failed to generate much enthusiasm and even though he maintains his lead at the front of the pack the rank and file Republicans want somebody else, somebody that can generate some enthusiasm other than an anti-Obama vote. They didn't want Romney 4 years ago and even though he has been repackaged he still leaves a sour taste for most Republicans.

You know, sarcasm and mockery dont prove jack.

The Romnuts campaign chairman, Bolling, is the Lt Govenor of the state and is putting his finger on the scales here.

The establishment suck ups here are really sounding like closet Democrats implying that all five of the seven candidates are too stupid or incompetent to get on the ballot, when the fact is THE GOP IS IS USING A VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE AND DISQUALIFYING SIGNATURES FOR THE MOST RIDICULOUS REASONS.

Gingrich and Perry both had more than 10k signatures turned in but Romnuts-Bolling lackeys tossed them out for absurd reasons that are being applied for the first time.

IF Keyes could get on the ballot in 2008 with his understaffed cadre of supportes in VA, then any thinking person should realize that serious changes have been made for this year.

But thats fine by me as this anti-democratic bullshit is going to kill any chance of Romnuts winning the election, period. Real Americans dont like elite annointed toadies chaosen in rigged elections.

The GOP establishment is committing slow motion political suicide.

That is because the GOP elite would rather lose the election than let the Tea PArty Movement have any influence on who gets the nomination.

Thats fine, I am ready to toss the GOP in the trash-heap of hsitory and start over with a new party.

Hopefully, if Romnuts gets the nomination, Paul or Trump with run as a t hird party candidate.

They will lose, but maybe it will prevent the Gop bloodsuckers from having a lot of tax-payers money to use to cement their control of the party.

If not, then lets have a new third party.
 
 
 
I do hope Gingrich makes it for the book signings. I believe that's the second serious Presidential candidate to ever do that..run a book tour and campaign. Cain was probably the first.

Man..Republicans are ambidextrous!

Showing that Gingrich must not be serious in his bid.

 

And the only two that are going to BE on the ballot are Romney and Paul. So 11 people filed, and only two were accepted. And you don't see this as being the least bit fishy?
 
 
 
Ron Paul will not defeat Obama. It will not be based on policy or philosophical differences

 

Um, do you really believe this???
 
 
 
 
Ron Paul will not defeat Obama. It will not be based on policy or philosophical differences

There is no reason for anyone to think Paul cant beat Obama.

In fact, I think Paul has a better chance of defeating Obama than either Gingrich or Romnuts.

The fact that the GOP establishment loathes Paul at a level of intensity one can only compare to a force of Nature just makes him all the better in my view.

If he fails to get the nomination, I pray to God he runs as a third party candidate.

Showing that Gingrich must not be serious in his bid.

 

And the only two that are going to BE on the ballot are Romney and Paul. So 11 people filed, and only two were accepted. And you don't see this as being the least bit fishy?

 

Of course not; he has drank the Kool Aid pitcher-emptied-straight-into-his maw-of-a-mouth style. he has no analytical facilities left to him.
 
 
 
But thats fine by me as this anti-democratic bullshit...

 

Anti-democratic.   A primary doesn't have to be 'democratic.' It's up to the party. States don't even have to HAVE primaries. In fact, for most of our history, candidates were chosen by party bosses / conventions.

You can thank the progressive movement for the change in bringing about direct primaries.

(Glenn Beck won't tell you that. lol)

I never said that primaries *have* to be (whatever you think that means) democratic.

I and most Americans much prefer primaries that are fair and impartial elections, not rigged by party bosses and their sycophants to give them predetermined results, which is essentially a form of fraud.

Of course you would be OK with the hypocrisy of a fixed election, but that shouldnt come as a surprize to anyone.

I think that means allowing any old signature penned by anyone which either doesn't qualify as a valid signature, or didn't bother to write their address.
 
 
It's almost as if some are saying Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck *should* be allowed as valid signatures.

(and on any large petition rosters you will find shit like that - that's why you get lots more than the base number required.)

(and if anyone is going to bring up Indiana, better think that one through...)
 
 
The Virginia legislature took up a bill to allow write ins on primary elections but it was defeated this year. I am not sure of the parliamentary rules in the Virginia legislature but I would think that it is too late for a new law to be enacted. Of course in politics anything is possible and all rules have exceptions.

 
Speaking to News4 outside the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception Sunday, Gingrich said, "We're disappointed, but it was our fault [as a campaign]."

 

 
"We're getting an amazing number of people who believe Virginians ought to have the right to choose and shouldn't be restricted to just two [candidates]," Gingrich said. "It's time for [Virginia] to change [the law]. If something's wrong, they ought to fix it."

Really, you classify the demand for honest open elections as 'wingnut world'?

When partisan cronies rig the rules of an election to disqualify five out of seven candidates, thats OK because it is according to the rules the cronies wrote to rig the election?

lololol

You are such an excellent example of what is wrong with our political system.

Thank you for that.
 
 
 
It's almost as if some are saying Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck *should* be allowed as valid signatures.

 

But they are in Virginia if you turn in 50% more than the minimum signatures.

So whats your point?

The point of the petition is to show broad support for a candidate to get on the ballot. Gingrich has been running among the top two candidates in Virginia for a while now so to disqualify him on the basis of bad addresses for the signatures on the petition is assinine and anti-democratic.

The GOP of Virginia does not trust its membership to vote for the parties nominee in an election that includes all the top candidates.

They are a bunch of elitist crony hypocrital frauds.

It does not mean only those things but many other situations as well as when someone wrote their address on the petition as '123 Bird Lane' But someone screwed up with the voter registration and put in '123 Bird Dr.' or even '123' Bird Ln.'

When cronies work the rules of the system for their patron, logic and intent are irrelevant.

Democrat cronies have done similar things for years to toss out GOP votes, and it seems like the GOP sellouts are now using such tactics against Tea Party people and the candidates they most support.
 
 
 
There is no reason for anyone to think Paul cant beat Obama.

In fact, I think Paul has a better chance of defeating Obama than either Gingrich or Romnuts.

 

Thats delusional thinking.

 
The fact that the GOP establishment loathes Paul at a level of intensity one can only compare to a force of Nature just makes him all the better in my view.

 

Their hate of Obama is infinitely more intense.

 
If he fails to get the nomination, I pray to God he runs as a third party candidate.

 

So do democrats.
 
 
The system was put into place to dissuade people from entering the primary except for the parties choices. People running for Senator in Virginia have to get the same amount of signatures to qualify. These rules were passed by a Democratic led legislature back in the 70's and the party hacks and office holders in Virginia like the rules because it keeps marginal candidates from running for office and wasting their resources.

So the 49 delegates will be split between Romney and Paul. Florida has 50 (?) delegates this year because they were penalized for moving their primary up to Jan 29 so Virginia does carry a little more weight than usual.

Actually, I think, judging by the level of outrage I am seeing by Republicans over this, you are going to see VA relent very quickly. I think this is going to be a major black eye for the GOP establishment trying to rig the game in Romney's favor.

But to the point, whatever else you want to say about them, Newt and Perry are not "Marginal" candidates. They are major contenders. The State Party pulling shit like this just shows that they don't want the nomination to be a real contest. They know their annointed candidate is awful and are trying to rig the game.

^^^ More made up shit from out of your ass.

You, nor anyone at this point, knows the full details on how Gingrich or Perry came up short -- it has not been reported yet if it was the overall number, whether they lacked addresses completely, whether someone filled in pages on their own, how many Mickey Mouses there actually were, if some addresses were not even *in* the state, or if the specific 11 congressional district /400 signature requirement was met.

Major contenders? To be a major contender you must make sure you are on the ballot in all the states and have people from those states working and volunteering to assist in getting the required signatures. In Virginia the only person who can get signatures are Virginia residents who are registered voters. You cannot ship in hired help or volunteers form other states to run signature petitions around. Of course Paul and Romney went through this 4 years ago and that is why they are on the ballot.
 
 
 
 
 
You're a fucking idiot. Bachman, Huntsman and Santorum didn't get enough signatures. Newt paid $1.50 per signature, got over 11,000, but many were not legitimate. That's why you have to get about twice as many signatures as needed in order to make sure you have enough legitimate ones. Which Mittens and Paul did.

You would think, as 'smart' as Newt claims to be, he would take the needed steps to get on the ballot in his own adopted state!  

 

So they only people the REPUBLICAN Party lets on the ballot are Mitt and the Crazy Guy, and you don't smell a fix? Really?

I hear Mitt Romney is going to hire Tonya Harding as his campaign director. Expect a lot of broken kneecaps in the next few weeks.

 

No. Virginia has the strictest ballot access requirements in the nation. Every candidate is aware of this, or should be.

 

Arkansas = 46,913
Georgia = 27,742
California = 26,500
Michigan = 15,000
New Mexico = 11,973
Virginia = 10,000

Note: as of 2003. Only two states rated an "A" and Virginia was one of only 4 states to rate a "B+" in terms of ballot access for candidates.

What the hell do you think validating an address is, dumbass?

It can mean anything the cronies want it to mean and this type of thing has happened before.

Truth is I dont know how many were eliminated for exactly what reason, but given the difficulty of getting on the Virginia ballot and the rumors that the main problem was matching the addresses, the things I am suggesting are not unreasonable.

I am not claiming to *know* anything about the hidden innards of a crony systems 'validation'.

I do know that it is a sham election when five of seven candidates are struck from the ballot.

Nope, don't believe I am.

We have different rules for petition signatures than we do for voting, in my state anyway. If you are registered, but at a different address than where you reside, you are still eligible to vote. Depending on where you vote, your ballot will be duplicated to the appropriate precinct.

If you are not registered at the address you put on a petition however, your signature is rejected. (but we do outreach to the voters to get them properly registered)

What did Bush and Harris do to eliminate those voters? Voter caging? That's a horse of a different color.

Everything that VA did for it's petition signature checking, we would have done in California.

You are engaging in circular logic here.

The GOP decided to scrutinize the petitions of non-Romney candidates to such a degree that it was impossible for them to get on the ballot. It shows a party establishment that has wed itself to a weak candidate they know their own voters don't like.

I'm starting to think more and more that Romney is a sacrificial lamb. The GOP doesn't really WANT to win. They know the economy is going to be awful for the next few years, why not let Obama get beaten up over it? They can reap benefits downballot in 2012 and bigger benefits in 2014 and 2016 as they groom Jeb Bush for the nomination. After 8 years of Obama's ineptitude, we'll look back at Dubya as the "golden era."

I don't know if you are aware, but this is the 21st century and you can't "screw up the address" in most of the voter registration software I've encountered. The system auto corrects to the information from the USPS and from GIS.

We don't reject for differences like "Dr vs Ave" or even a slight difference in spelling in street names. We also don't reject for apartment # changes since they still reside at the physical address. Also not rejected, name changes as long as there are similarities in the signature.

Bullshit. Bugs are not a design feature unless you work for Microsoft and every software package has bugs galore.

You can't be "struck from the ballot" when you don't even TRY to get on it.

 BREAKING: Gingrich 2,000 Ballot Signatures Short? 
 BearingDrift ^  | December 24, 2011 | Shaun Kennedy
Posted on Saturday, December 24, 2011 1:20:59 AM by  Plutarch 
UPDATE (12.53am): Sources at RPV are telling me that the 2,000 signatures do not have addresses on them… meaning that they cannot be verified. Newt Gingrich may very well be off the ticket in Virginia, folks…

===========
If that's the case, then right there, we can see how 2000 were tossed right out wholesale.

Unless some are thinking they officials should allow illegitimate signatures, and open themselves up to a challenge, and maybe have to defend (without hope of winning) a court case, or lose their job for doing that.
 
 
from the sopurce this was taken from (a conservative VA magazine) - another anonymous, but I can't see why someone would lie about this:

  Josh December 24, 2011 10:20 am I was one of the volunteers getting signatures for Romney. We had nearly 500 volunteers working every parade, GOP event, metro/VRE station, mall, craft fair, etc. in VA.

We made sure volunteers qualified the signers as registered VA voters and watched them properly sign & print their name, put their address down, give the date and the last four of their SS number.

There is no VA conspiracy. It was simple hard work by dedicated volunteers and a superior organization. What does this say about the rest that failed to qualify? Maybe the big leagues aren’t for them just yet. Romney had their efforts underway at the end of the summer til December. That is why they submitted the most – 16,000. I also saw Ron Paul supporters out too getting signatures. Why didn’t the other campaigns think they might need to do the same? Maybe they didn’t think they’d be around in March 2012.

These are fair elections. The candidates had their chance to get on the ballot and they BLEW it. They're not entitled to a place on the ballot, they have to earn it.

Nothing in this is rigged. The rules were set out long ago. Gingrich doesn't even deny that he failed to collect the necessary signatures.

 

Lol, now the debate is over. Inthemiddle has pofintificated!

lol

You think that a process that excludes five of seven candidates to be fair which proves you are either corrupt, stupid or just morally lame as hell.
 
 
 
 
TWO out of FOUR who actually submitted the paperwork were struck.

You can't be "struck from the ballot" when you don't even TRY to get on it.

If he had any integrity, he'd stop repeating the lie.

 

Alright, that's it, right there! You're lying. You're being sucked into the lie, speaking in their words. This is the stuff that gives them power, don't do it!

Last week, nobody was on the ballot. NOBODY! Two of the fourt who tried to get on the ballot failed to get on the ballot. They didn't fulfill their obligations. They were never on the ballot in the first place, so they were never struck from the ballot.

 

OK, then 'KEPT OFF THE BALLOT'.

Quibbling over semantics is the surest sign of a losing arguement.
 
 
 
 
You mean like five of seven candidates being struck from a ballot?

 

You see right there.

You lied again.

Folks, there is so much shit this dude keeps flinging, most of it not even worth addressing....but THIS - he keeps repeating over and over.

IT IS A LIE.

Five of seven candidates were NOT "struck from a ballot."

TWO out of FOUR who actually submitted the paperwork were struck.

You can't be "struck from the ballot" when you don't even TRY to get on it.

If he had any integrity, he'd stop repeating the lie.

 

lolololololol

You know what I mean, jack-ass. I am talking about the GOp keeping five of seven candidates off the ballot.

Call it what you will but your semantic quibbbling is nothing more than a red herring.

Dear sweet Jesus you are just squirming around the obvious fascist intent to deny the voters of Virginia the right to vote on ALL the major candidates.

The process doesn't exclude anyone. It creates a means by which people wishing to become a party's nominee can gain a position on the primary ballot. Everyone can do it. Gingrich just failed to do it. Some people didn't even try to do it.

Getting to vote on two of seven candidates runing is not a fair election, dumbass.

And the rules have not been enforced like this 'a long time ago'. This is a new process and should be seriously over-hauled.

Any petition process that eliminates five of seven candidates is inherently goose-steppingly hostile to the popular vote.

This is hilarious.

Reminds me of the joke where the mother of a soldier graduating from basic training saw her son was out of step with his platoon then remarked, 'Oh look! Everyone is out of step but Johnny!'

Bachman, Huntsman, Perry, Gingrich, and Santorum are not nitwits, nitwit. Two spent probably millions of dollars hiring pros to get them on the ballot, got well over the needed number but got disqualified by a rigged process that threw out over 35% of the signatures. The other three knew that this game was so rigged that they didnt even bother.

And thats OK by your estimation because 'Dims da rules, Dude!'

The fact that both have rules to qualify really escapes you, doesn't it?

That and the fact you actually have to...you know, *TRY* to be qualified in order to...ahem: say you were rejected from even being allowed to take part.
 
 
Instead of making excuses for these yahoos, the real question is why didn't they know what was required of them to get on the ballot?

Doesn't matter what the excuse is, the onus in on the "candidate" to know and fulfill those requirements.

And, Newt comparing his screw up to Pear Harbor is just beyond ridiculous. When he loses, will he compare it to 9/11?

What a bunch of "maroons".

Do you have any evidence of this.

Gingrich turned in 11,050, just over 10% greater signatures then required. From that how do you determine that 35% were disqualified? The second requirement is fthat 400 qualified voters were needed from each district. That means if for one district the Gingrich campaign only turned in 300 qualified signatures, then they could have turned in 1,000,000 signatures and it wouldn't have made any difference. Failure to qualify by district is very likely since it appears they tried to gather the required signatures late in the game at a couple of DC are rallies.

So, (a) please provide the source for the 35% rejection amount, and (b) please show where he met the requirement of 400 from each of the 11 congressional districts.

Thank you in advance for your supporting evidence.

Ron Paul will not defeat Obama. It will not be based on policy or philosophical differences

 

Um, do you really believe this???

 

There is no reason for anyone to think Paul cant beat Obama.

In fact, I think Paul has a better chance of defeating Obama than either Gingrich or Romnuts.

The fact that the GOP establishment loathes Paul at a level of intensity one can only compare to a force of Nature just makes him all the better in my view.
If he fails to get the nomination, I pray to God he runs as a third party candidate.

 

I said the same thing about Obama in 2008. That turned out pretty well, so who knows?
 
 
 
The fact that the GOP establishment loathes Paul at a level of intensity one can only compare to a force of Nature....

 

Explains why a conspiracy by the GOP establishment unjustly kept Gingrich from getting on the ballot, while Paul made it.

Guy, the point is, this would not have BEEN an issue if they weren't trying to rig the game.

Romney gets 5 of the 6 opponents disqualified from the ballot, that's a rigged game.

Maybe we like our nominees to be prepared, but we also like ones with a sense of fair play.

Do you really think he's going to be able to find a "technicality" to use against Obama?
 
 
 
 
 
The both had more than 10k, but Bolling and his cronies in the VA GOP machine simply tossed out enough to keep them off the ballot.

Keyes got enough in 2008 and wasnt considered a major candidate, so the GOP changed the rules this year so they could legally throw out as many signatures as they want.

But whatever happened to your respect for the voters? You really think that these ridiculous rules were meant to enable the choices for Virginian voters?

Of course not, it wasmeant to hand the state over to Romney, but he might get a huge surprise in March.

 

OK, Braniac: how many signatures did Keyes collect in 2008?

 

Lol, was Keyes on the ballot or not?

 

Yes - he collected enough signatures.

Yet, Newt 'Superior Intellect' Gingrich couldn't figure out Virginia's requirements!

 
 
 
 
 
Looks like Romney will win Virginia's Primary, so he can focus on other Super Tuesday states. It is beginning to look like Romney will be the main man for Republicans because of his steady base of support.

 
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has failed to qualify for Virginia's March 6 Republican primary, a development that adds to the challenges faced by the recent frontrunner in the GOP presidential race.
"After verification, RPV has determined that Newt Gingrich did not submit required 10k signatures and has not qualified for the VA primary," the Republican Party of Virginia announced early Saturday on its Twitter website.
Perry also fell short of the 10,000 signatures of registered voters required for a candidate's name to be on the primary ballot, but former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Rep. Ron Paul will be on the ballot.

 

 My Way News - GOP: Gingrich, Perry will not be on Va. Ballot 

 

This is shows a stunning lack of organization for supposed front runners in this primary. I have become increasingly disillusioned with the GOP primary. At the onset I was a stanch Paul supporter, motivated by the thought that Obama was infinitely beatable and that what was desperately needed was a candidate that would follow through on commitments to restore the Constitutional restrictions on a forever expanding federal government and unregulated central banking system.

Ron Paul will not defeat Obama. It will not be based on policy or philosophical differences, Paul vs. Obama would be portrayed as a white racist attack on the first black president.

Paul is not capable of adequately articulating his libertarian positions effectively nor will he resonate personally to a majority of Americans.

Looking at the field now I am more depressed and truly concerned for the future of this country. There isn't a candidate that I believe can both defeat Obama and actually dramatically reform the federal government.

Why do you CARE who is on the ballot in Virginia if you aren't going to vote for either of them anyway and you really think Newt is the weaker candidate?

It's the kind of kibbitzing that sounds a bit suspicious to me.

 

LOL....I don't care. I'm simply pointing out the FACTS.
 
 
 
This is hilarious.

Gingrich epically fails and the spin from the right is that the GOP establishment is cheating.

You guys look like a bunch of buffoons!

Looks like Romney will win Virginia's Primary, so he can focus on other Super Tuesday states. It is beginning to look like Romney will be the main man for Republicans because of his steady base of support.

 
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has failed to qualify for Virginia's March 6 Republican primary, a development that adds to the challenges faced by the recent frontrunner in the GOP presidential race.
"After verification, RPV has determined that Newt Gingrich did not submit required 10k signatures and has not qualified for the VA primary," the Republican Party of Virginia announced early Saturday on its Twitter website.
Perry also fell short of the 10,000 signatures of registered voters required for a candidate's name to be on the primary ballot, but former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Rep. Ron Paul will be on the ballot.

 

 My Way News - GOP: Gingrich, Perry will not be on Va. Ballot 

 

We're down to a Virginia ballot that will consist of Romney and possibly Ron Paul if he doesn't get disqualified too. All other GOP candidates failed to meet Virginia's requirements.

 
Republican presidential candidates Michele Bachmann, Jon Huntsman and Rick Santorum failed to qualify for the Virginia ballot, according to state GOP officials.

Four candidates  former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Ron Paul (Texas)  turned in thousands of signatures by the deadline.

Candidates had until 5 p.m. to collect 10,000 signatures from across the state, including 400 from each congressional district.

Virginia, an increasingly important swing state, will hold its primary on Super Tuesday, March

The signatures still must be certified by Republican Party of Virginia. Garren Shipley, a party spokesman, said he expects that to be completed by Friday.

Bachman, Huntsman, Perry, Gingrich, and Santorum are not nitwits, nitwit. Two spent probably millions of dollars hiring pros to get them on the ballot, got well over the needed number but got disqualified by a rigged process that threw out over 35% of the signatures. The other three knew that this game was so rigged that they didnt even bother.

And thats OK by your estimation because 'Dims da rules, Dude!'

lol, pathetic

 

Do you have any evidence of this.

Gingrich turned in 11,050, just over 10% greater signatures then required. From that how do you determine that 35% were disqualified? The second requirement is fthat 400 qualified voters were needed from each district. That means if for one district the Gingrich campaign only turned in 300 qualified signatures, then they could have turned in 1,000,000 signatures and it wouldn't have made any difference. Failure to qualify by district is very likely since it appears they tried to gather the required signatures late in the game at a couple of DC are rallies.

So, (a) please provide the source for the 35% rejection amount, and (b) please show where he met the requirement of 400 from each of the 11 congressional districts.

Thank you in advance for your supporting evidence.

Meh, I looked but couldnt find the thing I read the other day that said Gingrich missed the minimum by like 2500 signatures. So, honestly, I dont know how reliable the info is now that I cant double check it. Sometimes I get to reading so many sites, later I cant really remember which are just comments and which are more serious blogs and which are from news sources.

But my guesstimate was based on that 2500 number, plus the 1050 he turned in that was over the 10k he needed. That would be about 3550 of 11050 which off the top of my head was about 35%.

Instead of making excuses for these yahoos, the real question is why didn't they know what was required of them to get on the ballot?

 

They are the ballot because they spent millions of $$$ and hired professionals to make sure they were there...

That is ridiculous. Gingrich and Perry both hhired pros to do a job that they failed to do.

That is not a reflection on Gingrich and Perry but of the circumstances, and the contempt the Virginia bootlicks like Bolling have for a fair vote.

Thank you for acknowledging that at this time we don't have specifics about the decision process, the only specifics we do have (at this point) are the requirements under the law. We don't know if it was a lack of addresses (required to check voter registration and from what district they are from - if qualified) or if it was a lack of complying with the 400 from each district.

Time will tell as I think this will be challenged in court resulting in more details being released to the public.

Not at all. you people claimed all sorts of paranoid bullshit about butterfly ballots (designed by a Democrat, but helped Pat Buchanan) and expunging convicts from voter rolls (ordered by a court) in Florida in 2000. But at the end of the day, when given a chance, they re-elected Jeb and they re-elected Dubya.

In this case, they don't WANT the voters to get into it. They don't want to even take a chance that Romney will lose Virginia. NOPE. Let's keep EVERYONE else off the ballot except Ron Paul.

Let everyone on the ballot, let the voters decide. Seems like a simple enough solution to me.

For a fight you have no interest in, since you won't vote for ANYONE the GOP produces, no matter how bad Obama messes up the country, you seem awfully committed to who our nominee should be.

I'm sorry Joe. You've jumped the shark on this one and I still want Newt to be your nominee.

 

Your fervor for Romnuts puts the lie to what you claim.

And to answer the question you put to Joe, Romnuts people made the GOP validation process so onerous that many pros refused to take jobs getting those signatures, and the three candidates you named simply didnt bother.

So yes, Romnuts hacks kept all five off the ballot with the machinations of the typical political crony network.
 
 
 
 
 
A mistake I learned the hard way, unfortunately.

Here's the ironic thing, guy.

If Romney's the nominee, I'll vote for Obama, and I'll be on here taking up Obama's case.

Not because I want to. Obama has been the worst president of my lifetime. Carter takes on a new dignity by comparison.

But Romney is just a scummy human being.

 

For what it's worth, I can't in good conscience vote for either of them. I have no respect for Romney at all, and Obama has been little more than a third Dubya term, in my opinion.

I suspect I will go and vote for whatever warm body the Libertarian Party puts up there in order to preserve their ballot access for the next time around, then go punish my liver at the local watering hole. What else can one do?  

 

Unfortunately, that's pretty close to my plan.

 

Same here, but I might write in 'Anybodybutromnuts'. But might not do that since his cronies will be counting the votes and might decde that looks close enough to Romney to count it as intended for him.

And a blow job isn't really sex so Clinton wasn't technically lying.

 

Actually, that was Gingrich's defense.

Actually, what I do when I don't like the GOP Candidate is I write in "Jack Ryan".

Jack Ryan was the guy who challenged Obama in 2004, but the IL GOP sandbagged him because Judy Baar Topinka didn't want him challenging her for Governor in 2006. So they got him off the ballot over utter bullshit in his divorce file. So I wrote him in in 2004. And in 2006 for Governor. And in 2008 for the Senate Seat when Durbin came up against whatever non-entity the party put up that time.

I might be writing him in for President if it's a Romney vs. Obama fight.

I saw it PV, that provides no convincing details to me to definitively determine the specifics of how Newt failed to provide the required 10,000/400 qualified voter signatures. Could be out of state addresses, not addresses as part of the 10,000 or it could be 400 from each district.

I think we will know soon, but right now we don't have an official reason that can be confirmed - either by an official of the GOP on the record, a Board of Election official on the record, or as part of court documents.

The fact is that the requirement is 10,000/400 and when you submit only ~10% over that amount then your campaign is setting itself up for a problem.

They cant. No one can.

But the really disconcerting thing about all this is that the neocons have long been of two camps when it comes to respecting the democratic process. One groups with guys like Bill Benet and Jack Kemp were sincerely advocates of democracy and freedom and wanted American foreign policy to promote our system to the world because they genuinely believed in it.

Then the second camp basically regards the common voter as cattle, too stupid to do much more than consume products for the market and vote for whom they are best manipulated to vote for. This second camp is a bunch of fascists who really could not give a rat's proverbial ass about democracy or anything else. They make profits from the wars for democracy but that is about as far as their support for democracy goes; as long as they can make money from it.

This Bolling guy seems to be of the second camp, and that Romnuts is OK with his methods simply confirms that the fascists have succeded in becoming the dominant faction of neocons at the national level.

I would rather have fifty years of Obama than these fascists in charge for one damned day.

I've been reading a lot of ca-rap lately about how the "rules were changed" for this primary.

I see some who like to take Erick Erikson at his word in his diatribes from RedState (the man is a lying idiot, but nevermind that...)

Well, well, well. Look at what we have here: From 2008 - straight from Erick Erickson himself - COMPLAINING ABOUT THE GOP checking the signatures on the petitions of presidential candidates: " Romney, Fred, Rudy, McCain, Huckabee, and Paul all filed over 15,000 signatures each  well above the recommended minimums.

So what did the Virginia GOP do? Well, they did absolutely nothing to help any of the candidates other than put out clipboards at their state fair booth.

Then they decided to attempt some kind of unprecedented verification process. Historically, forms have never been checked by either party, often they never even open the boxes.
They gave no one notice of this new process. They sent all the campaigns an email notice the Friday afternoon after theyd all filed their signatures. You can see the memo below. As you can see its a ridiculous attempt to replicate Florida in 2000.

At the time, no one had any idea who the verifiers would be or who they supported. Likewise, everyone had questions on what did and did not constitute legitimate signatures. All the campaigns had to lawyer up against their own party.

The Executive Director of the Virginia GOP had the nerve to pace the room, during the verification process, in a referee jersey. Likewise, the process for verification changed throughout the day, despite the party sending out its guidelines ahead of time in writing."

So, what's that you say? It's not a "suddenly new" set of rules?

Eh?
 
 
Virginia requires candidates to obtain 10,000 signatures from registered voters, with at least 400 signatures coming from each

of the commonwealth's 11 congressional districts. Prior to this year, these numbers were not hard to hit.

Those signature requirements, by the way, were 10,000 signatures including 500 in each of the state’s congressional

districts. What apparently tripped up Gingrich and Perry was the requirement that petition signers list their

addresses.

A Gingrich campaign official prior to the move by the RPV said the problem is how the rules are set up, arguing that the

party is, for apparently the first time, cross-checking the addresses that signature-givers gave

against the electronic voter database file for accuracies. A name without a proper address match was tossed, the official said.

“What one needs to ask is ‘what percentage of valid, registered voters self-identify a current address that matches voter rolls

that the voter might not have updated since 2008”? Are you 100% certain that your address you and all of your

neighbors matches current voter rolls? It strikes me that this is not an accurate means to identify registered voters signing

for ANY candidate, not just Gingrich,” the official wrote.

 

But guess what? If you turned in a magic number of signatures, the state would not even validate ANY of the signatures you

turned in:

 VA Ballot Access – No Way to
Choose a President | RedState 

 
The Washington Examiner ran a gleeful hit piece Friday night quoting an anonymous “source with knowledge of the

Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) petition signature verification process” who said Perry was “dead on arrival” and didn’t

follow the “simple” rules required in VA...

The article also notes that the rules were sent to “all the Republican presidential campaigns” in March, but later admits that

Perry’s campaign may not have received the detailed instructions because he didn’t enter the race until August.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch informs us that the Romney campaign had their petitions personally delivered by none other than

Lt. Governor Bill Bolling, Romney’s VA campaign chairman....

The blog goes on to describe the process of gaining ballot access, which is likely the most burdensome in the country:

“A minimum of 10,000 petition signatures collected statewide, including at least 400 from each of its 11 congressional

districts. That’s hard enough. But then there are the additional restrictions: The petition circulators must be

registered or eligible to vote in Virginia. The signatures must be gathered using the State Board of Elections’ official

form, a two-page document which must be reproduced as double-sided. (Single-sided stapled forms are not accepted.)

Signatures must be collected on forms that are specific to each city, county and congressional district. Only “

qualified ” voters may sign a petition. And every single petition form must be sworn and notarized.”

The blogger claims to know top political consultants who turned town lucrative offers working on presidential campaigns because

they thought the task could not be accomplished.

To make matters worse, the Republican Party of Virginia appears to have rigged the system in favor of candidates who were able

to gather a comfortable excess of names on petitions. Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, Pat Mullins, issued the

following (undated) directive:

“ Any candidate who submits at least 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions
statewide and has at least 600 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions from each of the 11 Congressional

Districts shall be deemed to have met the threshold for qualification and will be certified (provided, of course, that

other requirements of State law have also been met)”

“If any candidate submits fewer than 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions statewide or fewer than 600

signatures of registered voters on valid petitions in one or more of the 11 Congressional Districts, the Republican Party of

Virginia will individually verify signatures until the 10,000 signature statewide threshold and/or 400 per Congressional

district is met.”

In other words, if a candidate can gather 50% more signatures than actually required, the standard for those

signatures is lower than for the signatures of candidates who gather 14,999 signatures or less. It appears that

the Romney campaign, which boasted of gathering “some 16,000? signatures was able to escape the scrutiny of having every

signature individually verified.

 

The chairman for the Romney campaign is also the Lt Govenor of Virginia!

 Bolling ties 2013 hopes to Romney -
Washington Times 

Yeah, no conflict of interest there! Perry was not notified of the state requirements, too damn bad for him! Since he cant read

Bollings mind thousands of miles away, he is obviously not qualified to run! And Gingriches signatures were not valid,

obviously since he didnt stuff enough of them to get over a 15,000 count! Yerp, the more you cheat the less scrutiny you get in

Virginia.

The GOP establishment has totally destroyed one Tea Party candidate after another: Palin, Bachman, Perry, Cain, Gingrich is

sinking and the guns starting on Ron Paul now, whom the establishment apparently thinks is too extreme to really challenge

Romney.

They have a surprise coming. They are alienating more voters than votes they can steal, and even if Romney wins the nomination,

he will definately to lose to Obama because the GOP base, the social conservatives, are sick of the dirty tricks, the slander,

and the cronyism of the GOP establishment. After Obama wins re-election the social conservative and Tea Party groups will get

more funding than the GOP establishment ever dreamed of. They may try to go back and fight the rigged game the GOP has now, but

my bet is that they will split off and form a new party.

It worked in Canada and there is no reason to believe it cannot work in the USA.
 
 
Again, I'm truly impressed by the concern that the Democrats suddenly have for Republican rules..

Fact is, they are selectively enforcing the rules to get a pre-determined result.

they've realized that they can't get Romney nominated honestly, so they are going to cheat. Whatever it takes.

The ironic thing is, Newt's already peaked. They are making sure no one takes his place.
 
 
 
 
 
GOP voters in VA who actually give a darn have no one to blame but the candidate...

 

Lol, yeah because we all know how these cronies only screw over those who really deserve it.

So, if thhis is just politics as usual, can you name another Presidential state primary in the past where five of seven serious candidates were kept off the ballot?

And by serious, I mean they got a lot of donations, advertising on their behalf, were invited to the debates, etc?

Just name one.

I've been reading a lot of ca-rap lately about how the "rules were changed" for this primary.

I see some who like to take Erick Erikson at his word in his diatribes from RedState (the man is a lying idiot, but nevermind that...)

Well, well, well. Look at what we have here: From 2008 - straight from Erick Erickson himself - COMPLAINING ABOUT THE GOP checking the signatures on the petitions of presidential candidates: " Romney, Fred, Rudy, McCain, Huckabee, and Paul all filed over 15,000 signatures each  well above the recommended minimums.

So what did the Virginia GOP do? Well, they did absolutely nothing to help any of the candidates other than put out clipboards at their state fair booth.

Then they decided to attempt some kind of unprecedented verification process. Historically, forms have never been checked by either party, often they never even open the boxes.
They gave no one notice of this new process. They sent all the campaigns an email notice the Friday afternoon after theyd all filed their signatures. You can see the memo below. As you can see its a ridiculous attempt to replicate Florida in 2000.

At the time, no one had any idea who the verifiers would be or who they supported. Likewise, everyone had questions on what did and did not constitute legitimate signatures. All the campaigns had to lawyer up against their own party.

The Executive Director of the Virginia GOP had the nerve to pace the room, during the verification process, in a referee jersey. Likewise, the process for verification changed throughout the day, despite the party sending out its guidelines ahead of time in writing."

So, what's that you say? It's not a "suddenly new" set of rules?

Eh?

 

What is new is the scrutiny that they are using as they compare all the data to the voter registration data base.

Are you really that stupid or does it require some effort?

For the honest conservatives out there.
Read this part again: "" Romney, Fred, Rudy, McCain, Huckabee, and Paul all filed over 15,000 signatures each – well above the recommended minimums."

They all filed over 15,000 in 2007. Seems like they knew then about the buffer necessary and didn't take chances. Enough people were easily convinced to sign the petition.

And now, when Gingrich obviously failed to be aware of what his own party in the last election knew was necessary, the narrative turns to how it's the RPV's fault.

This is what Gingrich is famous for - changing the narrative. He has cleverly convinced his swallowers to focus on how the rules shouldn't apply to him and they actually should turn a blind eye to petition fraud. The focus is off him or his failures.

The real narrative here, and this should not be lost on anyone, is how this major candidate, in his own state of residency, which is a significant Super Tuesday Primary was so organizationally weak and frought with incompetence he could not even garner more than 11,050 signatures.

It's a pretty bad sign when people have to defend a guy who can't even get a.003 of those registered voters. With *months* of advance notice, he should have been able to get 20,000 signatures! The people should have been eager to sign petitions if he is so popular. Yet, they didn't. That says a lot.
 
 
newt coulda been a contender.
 
 
Gingrich: Once a cheater, always a cheater.
 
 
 
Guy, the point is, this would not have BEEN an issue if they weren't trying to rig the game.

 

Yes it would. Nobody is trying to rig the system. Gingrich failed. Why can't you understand that?

 
Romney gets 5 of the 6 opponents disqualified from the ballot, that's a rigged game.

 

Nobody got anybody disqualified. Gingrich FAILED.

 
Maybe we like our nominees to be prepared, but we also like ones with a sense of fair play.

 

Where is the "fair play" in ignoring the election laws of the state that have been established for years, all for Gingrich?
 
 
I read this ealier on the FrumForum, a comment of good merit:

" Let me make sure I understand the concern...

10,000 validated signatures are required to get on the ballot. The concern here is that the State GOP might have done something radical for this election cycle in response to the mentioned lawsuit. The alleged action? Check to make sure the signatures were valid.

Is this a shift in the rules? No — the signatures always had to be valid. This would be the shocking and radical change of actually enforcing the long-standing rules. The GOP, the party that has been screaming about voter fraud, checked to make sure Mickey Mouse didn’t sign the petition.

This is a big concern for the GOP. It is remarkably unfair to expect Newt and Rick to both understand the rules and comply with them. The long-standing occurrence of being able to file false signatures with impunity is a hallowed tradition, and the State GOP should be ashamed of itself for expecting candidates to obey the laws.

Do I have that right? Because if I do, I’d like to respectfully suggest that the GOP might want to consider if this episode indicates a perhaps slightly more serious issue that y’all ought to think about looking at."

Under that responsibility, I intend to certify candidates for the Republican Presidential and
Senatorial primaries using the following guidelines:
Under the Code of Virginia, any candidate who wants to have their name placed on the March 6,
2012 Republican Presidential Ballot or the June 12, 2012 U.S. Senate Primary must collect the
signatures of 10,000 registered voters statewide, with at least 400 signatures of registered voters from
each of Virginia’s 11 Congressional Districts.
Any candidate who submits at least 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions
statewide and has at least 600 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions from each of the 11
Congressional Districts shall be deemed to have met the threshold for qualification and will be certified
(provided, of course, that other requirements of State law have also been met).
If any candidate submits fewer than 15,000 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions
statewide or fewer than 600 signatures of registered voters on valid petitions in one or more of the 11
Congressional Districts, the Republican Party of Virginia will individually verify signatures until the

Well, howdy do-do!

Lookie there. A formal paper dating back to May of 2011.

"ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS ON MAY 25, 2011."

Sent out this summer. And the connie idiots somehow want to pretend 'it's all a con-speer-a-SEE. See?

Good find zzzz.
 
 
 
from the sopurce this was taken from (a conservative VA magazine) - another anonymous, but I can't see why someone would lie about this:

  Josh December 24, 2011 10:20 am I was one of the volunteers getting signatures for Romney. We had nearly 500 volunteers working every parade, GOP event, metro/VRE station, mall, craft fair, etc. in VA.

We made sure volunteers qualified the signers as registered VA voters and watched them properly sign & print their name, put their address down, give the date and the last four of their SS number.
There is no VA conspiracy. It was simple hard work by dedicated volunteers and a superior organization. What does this say about the rest that failed to qualify? Maybe the big leagues aren’t for them just yet. Romney had their efforts underway at the end of the summer til December. That is why they submitted the most – 16,000. I also saw Ron Paul supporters out too getting signatures. Why didn’t the other campaigns think they might need to do the same? Maybe they didn’t think they’d be around in March 2012.

TWO out of FOUR who actually submitted the paperwork were struck.

You can't be "struck from the ballot" when you don't even TRY to get on it.

If he had any integrity, he'd stop repeating the lie.

 

Alright, that's it, right there! You're lying. You're being sucked into the lie, speaking in their words. This is the stuff that gives them power, don't do it!

Last week, nobody was on the ballot. NOBODY! Two of the fourt who tried to get on the ballot failed to get on the ballot. They didn't fulfill their obligations. They were never on the ballot in the first place, so they were never struck from the ballot.

 

OK, then 'KEPT OFF THE BALLOT'.

Quibbling over semantics is the surest sign of a losing arguement.

 

And that's a good thing! It weeds out the " The Rent Is Too Damn High " candidates.

Tell me: Disney has raised it's admission to around $80. If I show up with $100, but a percentage of it is in Mexican Pesos and Korean Wan, do they have to let me in? No. They have successfully "KEPT ME OUT OF THE PARK".

It's a CONSPIRACY!!!! It's the Amusement Park Elite rigging the game!!!  

See, they only take U.S. currency. Their rules. I should know the rules and show up with at least $80 U.S.

Newt should have known the rules. Especially since he's such a brain.  
 
 
All this belly aching from the Gingrich lackeys. And we're still left with these facts:

*Gingrich did not submit the necessary signatures
*All the candidates were given ample notice of the requirements
*It is Romney's fault. Or Obama's fault. Or "the Establishment's" fault.

All this talk of signatures and addresses, I'm realizing more and more where the blame lies: GINGRICH AND HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF.

I'm sure that most of you here have never been involved in collecting signatures to get a candidate on the ballot. But I have. So let me tell you a little bit about how things tend to go....

First, there are two basic approaches one can take. You can try to get volunteers out to collect signatures, or you can try to pay people to collect signatures. The benefit of volunteers is that it's free, but the drawback is that you have to have more of them, while having more difficulty recruiting people who are willing to do the work, and you're gambling on whether they're going to put forth much effort. The benefit of paying people is that you can more easily recruit people and they are more likely to go out and attempt to collect signatures, all of which leads to more overall signatures. The drawback is that it can become expensive, you have to worry about unscrupulous workers forging signatures for extra money, and paying for invalid signatures that are collected by honest mistake which don't get you any closer to where you're going.

I'm betting that Gingrich's campaign used paid contractors to collect signatures. When I've done this, the deal usually goes that for every signature you collect, you get a small payment, say $2 per signature. But, there's an additional criterion, to help mitigate some of the problems I just mentioned. Usually, there's a threshold for your valid signatures which determined whether you get paid for every signature you collect, or only the ones that turn out to be valid. So, let's say that the threshold is 85%. That means that if 85% or more of your signatures are valid, then you'll get paid for 100% of your total signatures. On the other hand, if less than 85% are valid, you'll be paid for only your total valid signatures.

Now, in my experience, the people running the show tend to encourage collectors to collect as many signatures as possible, and not worry as much about validity. They'll tell you "If someone says they aren't sure whether they've changed their address on their registration yet, take the signature anyway. You can't get paid for their signature if you don't collect it." Of course, it makes sense that they encourage this. They want the signatures. If it's invalid, the campaign doesn't lose anything, as opposed to not having it at all. But there's another side of it. The campaign wants you to have less than that 85% validity because they don't want to pay for invalid signatures. And since they recruit by advertising things like "TEMP WORK, MAKE UP TO $500 A DAY" they tend to draw in alot of idiots foaming at the mouth for get-rich-quick BS, who just don't think about it.

In any event, when I've done this stuff, I took a very different approach. I was intent on quality over quantity, and intent on having at least 85% valid signatures. I would always firmly question people to ensure that their signature would be valid, and would decline to take their signatures if I felt there was a good chance that their address wasn't going to match, or whatever. I was in it for the money after all. And I NEVER once fell short of whatever my validity threshold was. I still always managed to average 50 signatures an hour. I was just that smart and that good.

So the point to all of this is that collecting valid signatures is NOT that difficult by any means. It just takes a little bit of effort (and I mean LITTLE) and a little bit of the right focus and priorities. If Gingrich needed 10,000 valid signatures I could have gotten him in two months by myself. Now that I'm thinking about it, too bad we didn't know in September how this was going to turn out. Maybe I should have sent him my resume. I would have given him 15,000 signatures with at least 85% validity, for the bargain price of $23,000 plus travel accommodations. Small beans in terms of campaign expenses.

Gingrich has nobody to blame other than himself and his campaign.
 
 
 
 
Okay...I'll bite. How did Romney make sure that the rest of the candidates didn't even file in VA?

 

Mormons. Can't turn your back on 'em!

Pretty funny.  
 
 
 
 
 
Fair elections are no big deal to you? Rigged votes are OK?

Shove it.

 

These are fair elections. The candidates had their chance to get on the ballot and they BLEW it. They're not entitled to a place on the ballot, they have to earn it.

Nothing in this is rigged. The rules were set out long ago. Gingrich doesn't even deny that he failed to collect the necessary signatures.

 

Getting to vote on two of seven candidates runing is not a fair election, dumbass.

And the rules have not been enforced like this 'a long time ago'. This is a new process and should be seriously over-hauled.

Any petition process that eliminates five of seven candidates is inherently goose-steppingly hostile to the popular vote.

 

There are a lot more running. Buddy Roemer, for one. None of them qualified, either. Only the serious candidates, with an organization. Newt is not serious and has no organization and has no money. Just like Gov. Gary Johnson.

The petition process didn't eliminate anybody, EXCEPT those who do not collect 10,000 legitimate, verifiable signatures.
 
 
 
 
 
You think that a process that excludes five of seven candidates to be fair which proves you are either corrupt, stupid or just morally lame as hell.

 

The process doesn't exclude anyone.

 

AGain, you try to fall back on semantic bullshit.

FIVE OF SEVEN CANDIDATES WILL NOT BE ON THE BALLOT.

That means it is a broken process.

 
It creates a means by which people wishing to become a party's nominee can gain a position on the primary ballot. Everyone can do it. Gingrich just failed to do it. Some people didn't even try to do it.

 

FIVE OF SEVEN DID NOT DO IT.

Are you just stupid or do you just want to eleminate voters choices to please the cronies running the game?

Probably both is my guess.

 

That's because they are dumbasses!

Michele Bachmann? Really? She's gonna get 10,000 fans in Virginia?

Rick "Rain Man" Perry? There are over 10,000 Virginians who have watched his debate performances and said " Yeah, that's the kind of grasp on serious matters that this country needs! "? Seriously?

Wake up, NewtBoi.
 
 
 
All this belly aching from the Gingrich lackeys. And we're still left with these facts:

*Gingrich did not submit the necessary signatures
*All the candidates were given ample notice of the requirements
*It is Romney's fault. Or Obama's fault. Or "the Establishment's" fault.

All this talk of signatures and addresses, I'm realizing more and more where the blame lies: GINGRICH AND HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF.

I'm sure that most of you here have never been involved in collecting signatures to get a candidate on the ballot. But I have. So let me tell you a little bit about how things tend to go....

First, there are two basic approaches one can take. You can try to get volunteers out to collect signatures, or you can try to pay people to collect signatures. The benefit of volunteers is that it's free, but the drawback is that you have to have more of them, while having more difficulty recruiting people who are willing to do the work, and you're gambling on whether they're going to put forth much effort. The benefit of paying people is that you can more easily recruit people and they are more likely to go out and attempt to collect signatures, all of which leads to more overall signatures. The drawback is that it can become expensive, you have to worry about unscrupulous workers forging signatures for extra money, and paying for invalid signatures that are collected by honest mistake which don't get you any closer to where you're going.

I'm betting that Gingrich's campaign used paid contractors to collect signatures. When I've done this, the deal usually goes that for every signature you collect, you get a small payment, say $2 per signature. But, there's an additional criterion, to help mitigate some of the problems I just mentioned. Usually, there's a threshold for your valid signatures which determined whether you get paid for every signature you collect, or only the ones that turn out to be valid. So, let's say that the threshold is 85%. That means that if 85% or more of your signatures are valid, then you'll get paid for 100% of your total signatures. On the other hand, if less than 85% are valid, you'll be paid for only your total valid signatures.

Now, in my experience, the people running the show tend to encourage collectors to collect as many signatures as possible, and not worry as much about validity. They'll tell you "If someone says they aren't sure whether they've changed their address on their registration yet, take the signature anyway. You can't get paid for their signature if you don't collect it." Of course, it makes sense that they encourage this. They want the signatures. If it's invalid, the campaign doesn't lose anything, as opposed to not having it at all. But there's another side of it. The campaign wants you to have less than that 85% validity because they don't want to pay for invalid signatures. And since they recruit by advertising things like "TEMP WORK, MAKE UP TO $500 A DAY" they tend to draw in alot of idiots foaming at the mouth for get-rich-quick BS, who just don't think about it.

In any event, when I've done this stuff, I took a very different approach. I was intent on quality over quantity, and intent on having at least 85% valid signatures. I would always firmly question people to ensure that their signature would be valid, and would decline to take their signatures if I felt there was a good chance that their address wasn't going to match, or whatever. I was in it for the money after all. And I NEVER once fell short of whatever my validity threshold was. I still always managed to average 50 signatures an hour. I was just that smart and that good.

So the point to all of this is that collecting valid signatures is NOT that difficult by any means. It just takes a little bit of effort (and I mean LITTLE) and a little bit of the right focus and priorities. If Gingrich needed 10,000 valid signatures I could have gotten him in two months by myself. Now that I'm thinking about it, too bad we didn't know in September how this was going to turn out. Maybe I should have sent him my resume. I would have given him 15,000 signatures with at least 85% validity, for the bargain price of $23,000 plus travel accommodations. Small beans in terms of campaign expenses.

Gingrich has nobody to blame other than himself and his campaign.

 

Killer post!

 
 
 
 
Actually, what I do when I don't like the GOP Candidate is I write in "Jack Ryan".

Jack Ryan was the guy who challenged Obama in 2004, but the IL GOP sandbagged him because Judy Baar Topinka didn't want him challenging her for Governor in 2006. So they got him off the ballot over utter bullshit in his divorce file. So I wrote him in in 2004. And in 2006 for Governor. And in 2008 for the Senate Seat when Durbin came up against whatever non-entity the party put up that time.

I might be writing him in for President if it's a Romney vs. Obama fight.

 

Bullshit. He was done in, ala Gary Hart, by his reckless and kinky sexual demands made upon his wife Jeri Ryan (of Star Trek fame), in public places.

 
 
 
 
^^^^^ WRITTEN IN MAY. MAY 2011.

Clear as the little pimples on the end of your nose.

So, try again with the new spin that "they changed the rules" just a week before...it's a conspiracy!...the fix was in....blah blah...

Try it.

If you can.

 

I find it amusing that you Democrats who fought against poll taxes and literacy tests and other things to disenfranchise voters are going along with this nonsense... because you are more afraid of Newt than you are of Mittens.

Fact remains, the voters should have the choice, NOT an unelected board of political hacks.

Well, that's the point. The woman appeared in Star Trek Voyager.. What could possibly have embarrassed her after that?

Incidently, the judge rejected her claims, because they were bogus. She was banging one of the producers and was making crap up to avoid joint custody. The judge ignored her claims and granted joint custody. And that should have been the end of the matter, until the Chicago Media started digging around.

Oddly, they never found the videos of Reverand Wright saying "GOD DAMN AMERICA!" with Obama in the congregation. They were too busy digging into old divorce files.

That so totally misses the point.

It's fair game to fight over the rules before they are set. But once they are set, everyone plays by the same rules. Instead of bitching about it after the fact - and whining about conspiracies - the candidates should have done something about it beforehand.
 
 
BTW Gingrich doesn't have much of an organization. Or money. So why is anyone surprised this happened? He's not on the ballot in OH an MO either.
 
 
 
 
 
Okay...I'll bite. How did Romney make sure that the rest of the candidates didn't even file in VA?

 

Mormons. Can't turn your back on 'em!  

 

They're like Ninjas!

And won't be on the ballot in Nov. 2012.

But he will be out selling books to the gullable concerning how the election was stolen from him.

How was the elction stolen from him? Winning Virginia is not that important, in and of itself.

If the TPM can get one leading candidate, the others may withdraw, allowing that candidate to sweep the other Super Tuesday states.

The outrageous part of this is the blatant cronyism the GOP establishment is using to keep all but two candidates off the ballot.

To hell with them; if Romnuts gets the nomination I will vote for Obama.

Better to have a socialist in there than fascists like the people behind Romnuts.

Might as well get used to having President Obama till 2016.

Better that than the man with the magic underwear.

Or you can JUST LET THE VOTERS DECIDE!!!!!

What a concept!

It's not a matter of the rules, it's a matter of the refs.
 
 
All democratic decisions are made according to the rules, JoeBigot, and Newt's gang failed.

Grow up.

Nope, I'll just support a third party.

Your boy really stepped in it this time, judging by the level of outrage I'm seeing in the RW blogosphere. This is the kind of Chicago Dirty tricks we might expect from Obama, but we really ought to be better than this, don't you think?

A party that doesn't trust its own voters really can't expect their loyalty, can it?
 
 
More precisely, some are just upset the refs are following the rules they warned the players about months in advance, Years to most) --- screaming HEY! YO! These are the rules.

Now, pussy's get all pouty cause the ref called foul when they didn't follow the rules.

Works for me...

They seem to have enough signatures, let's let the voters work it out.

Considering how badly recalls have gone for you guys up to this point, I'm not worried.

Everyone is on the ballot. Everyone has a fair shot of getting a vote.

Sounds completely fair to me.

I mean, not to Mitt, who is hated by 75% of republicans and 26% don't even think he's a real Christian, but to any sensible person, that's fair.

Why not just use the debate rules. If you are polling at more than 2%, you are on the ballot. It works well enough for the debates, why not the vote?

 More trouble for Gingrich as Iowa campaign quickens - Yahoo! News 

 
Gingrich's critics said many of his problems are of his own making due to a lack of discipline, pointing most recently to his inability to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot for the Republican primary in Virginia where he lives.
"What has to worry voters most is that Newt and his campaign are failing even the most basic tests," said Kevin Madden, a former spokesman for Romney and an informal adviser to the campaign.
"How can you argue that you're equipped to take on Obama's billion-dollar attack machine when you can't even get on the ballot in your home state of Virginia," Madden said.

 

         
 
 
Joe's entire argument seems to be "let the voters decide." He keeps throwing that out there, as if disagreeing with his bellyaching is a disagreement with voter empowerment. Which is completely false. He abandons any attempt to put forth a system by which voters can be presented with a ballot from which to decide. Which is what this issue is actually about. Everyone here agrees that the voters should decide. But Joe here is being deliberately ignorant. While he doesn't say it, what he's really getting at is that he believes that Gingrich should be magically entitled to appear on the ballot instantly, without any consideration for the need to have an organized system in place. This kind of entitlement complex leads to all kinds of faulty thinking. Like camping out in public parks for months on end, pissing and shitting in the daffodils, and petitioning one's government for a redress of grievances. And who would want that? Not Gingrich, that's for sure.

Once again, moron. Let the voters decide. It's a simple enough concept.

The Party hacks don't trust the voters. They might do something unexpected.

The real problem here is the hacks want Romney, but the rank and file don't. The guy has been mired at 25% for a year as one challenger after another has popped up and had to be smacked down. So unable to win the voters over with his personality, they decide- Let's cheat.

Because nothing a plutocrat hates more than a fair fight, wouldn't you agree.
 
 
The voters will decide...they just won't be deciding on Gingrich because he couldn't follow the rules.  
 
 
The gnashing over this Gingrich fail has to be one of the weirder cases of butthurt I've encountered here.
