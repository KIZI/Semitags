WASHINGTON -- Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., on Kennedy's easy manner:

"When were negotiating the No Child Left Behind bill, we did most of the
negotiations in the top floor of the Capitol in his hideaway, and he'd
always bring Splash, his dog, along. The dog was great, because it always
distracted everybody and gave everybody something to talk about. It would
just sit on his lap while the discussions were going on."
