President of the Hellenic Republic Karolos Papoulias has accepted the proposal
by Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou to serve a second term in Greece's
highest post, as it was formally announced on Monday afternoon.

"I accept the nomination for my re-election to the Presidency of Greece,"
Papoulias said.

Both ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) party and the main opposition
New Democracy party endorse Papoulias' second term at the post. The election is
due in parliament in the forthcoming March.

Papoulias was elected by an overwhelming parliamentary majority of 279 out of
300 votes to serve a five-year term in February 2005. He was sworn in as the 7th
president of the Third Hellenic Republic on March 12, 2005.

Papoulias, born in 1929, was a founding member of the PASOK and a close
associate of its leader Andreas Papandreou.
