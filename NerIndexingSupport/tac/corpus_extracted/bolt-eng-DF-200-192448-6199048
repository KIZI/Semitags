He's regarded as the most brilliant intellectual alive etc. etc.

I am wondering what people here think of him, and also what books they can recommend as his output is unbelievably high.  
 
 
He is not regarded as anything of the sort by many of those familiar with his political views. Put simply, it's not surprising he's regarded as the pinnacle of academia, because academics are generally substantially to the left of the average person and he's so far to the left he's giving Michael Moore a run for his money. Your average person with a crumb of respect for their own country and civilisation, who's not dedicated to placing enemy dictators - no matter who - on pedestals, regard Chomsky as the deceiving, ranting moonbat he is. He's basically Michael Moore with a talent for linguistics. That's it.
 
 
What Chomsky have you read JonathanH ?

No, he's not. He's regarded as being on the lunatic fringe by just about every professor I've ever talked to. His crap might be good for the leftist common masses, but it's absolutely horrendous for works that are supposed to be academic.
 
 
People don't like dissidence i guess
 
 
He was voted a the No.1 Gloabl intellectual. He's won numerous academic awards, so he is regarded as that actually.

His works with Herman do have a lot of evidence to back them up.

Why? Go and check out some of his major works and forget what some students on an itty bitty internet forum think.

You deleted it? My quote defeats the point of that surely?    
 
 
Well I think that what he has suggested about acquisitions of languages and grammars is pretty good tbh.

You've not heard the Chomsky quote?
"I choose to live in what I think is the greatest country in the world"

hardly.

I think he's a hypocritical and money-grabbing, I don't much care for him personally or politically.

Fair enough. I am not familiar with Chomsky's works so I shall refrain from comment; however, I think it is important to note that an intellectual and an academic are not the same, nor are they mutually exclusive.
 
 
Amazing if you read his book on Terrorism published in the late 80's in response to the Noriega and Panama affairs under Reagan, that it actually rehashes most of the sentiments he made later in publishing work about 9-11, Bush and the Middle East.

What this says about Chomsky himself or the continual gaucheries performed by western nations when it comes to terrorism is obviously a question or more pertinently a statement that needs to be pondered over.

As a linguistic myself, I enjoy most of his work.

Most professors, especially those in linguistic departments almost hate him by default - because every single psycho-linguistic or socio-linguist approach has some witty aphoristic statement attached to his name.

I think its highly impossible to give a lecture on linguistics without mentioning Mr Chomsky's name.

Because of his political opinions, he's basically a ten foot mutant Albert Einstein who is not universally recognised in the academic world as forming any rudimentary opinions on his subject matter, despite cognising what half of the language professors have already studied via Chomsky's own work.
 
 
As I understand it from the books of his that I've read, the reason he's a permanent thorn in the side of the centre-right in America is because although he rarely offers a solution to the problems that he argues exists, he's nigh-on impossible to argue against.

Chomsky has an unquestionable "let me point out the problems without offering solutions" approach to his books, which are pretty much him gathering and presenting facts for you. There isn't a whole bunch of opinion in there to give the text bias or sway you and it is for that reason that the neo-conservatives really struggle to debate with him - usually resulting to "Well why do you still live here if you hate America so much?" type statements.
 
 
Chomsky is clearly regarded as one of the world's foremost intellectuals: look at how many honorary doctorates and awards he's won, not to mention the revolutionary impact he has had in his field (universal grammar; linguistics).

He is also most definitely not regarded 'as being on the lunatic fringe' by most professors. Go and watch the debate against Harvard's Dershowitz if you need evidence that his arguments are based on fact and academically defensible.
 
 
I've seen that debate, he utterly destroyed Dershowitz!
Oh no, Thud says he isn't regarded as the foremost intellectual, she's obviously right.

Last time I checked, one's credibility wasn't decided by one's rhetorical skills.
 
 
He's a very very good linguist, but not so hot on the politics.

His works are very biased and sometimes quite factually incorrect.  Here  you can find some of these statements that have been questioned. I think the authors probably go too far (I'm always wary of claims of "antisemitism") and they have their own axe to grind, but it demonstrates the point. Also his writing is very dull.
 
 
What numpty gave me anonymous neg rep for the first post?

Er no, and you obviously aren't referring to Chomsky, because it's well-known that he actually lacks retheorical skills, along with a fairly monotonous style of speaking.

Don't bother. 'Facts and academically defensible' mean nothing to him.

Hah. Yeah, people like him often profess to love their country whilst demeaning, insulting and undermining it at every opportunity, whilst praising it's enemies.
 
 
Talking purely about his political works, he writes with the most palpable biased and agenda of everyone i've ever read. He makes some valid, intersting points especially in manufacturing consent then absolutely udner mines them bu screaming SHOCK HORROR A COUNTRY ACTED IN ITS OWN NATIONAL INTEREST.

I find that unlikely, so why dont you put a link to the debate.

What a surprise that a Zionist says that! Shocked!

Go to youtube, and type in "Chomsky" and "Dershowitz". It's in 10 parts.

If you actually find yourself siding with Dershowitz's hysterical rhetoric then I suggest therapy.

Chomsky likes many aspects of American society etc.
That doesn't mean he shouldn't point out where they are going wrong. Though i wouldn't expect an ardent zionist to listen to him in the first place.
 
 
He's one of those academics I despise (there are right wing ones too) who instead of attempting to look at the facts and analyse them in an erudite manner instead is only to be concerns with endlessly bashing out his opinion endlessly. There is a place for such people (politicians and revolutionaries) but not in academics.

He is probably one of the greatest linguists alive though. His generative grammar is now almost universally accepted and his theories proved by many case studies (not least Creole languages and feral children).

Well after watching it, i have concluded 2 things, if you think that Dershowitz got destroyed, there are 2 options, either i watched a diffrent debate or you have gon to planet chomsky where the two of you can be live happily ever after.

If you think he got destroyed you missed the point of the debate which was about a solution for peace, and as ferrus correctly pointed out chomsky simply likes to critisize and never come up with a solution, he just makes every comment he can selectivly claim to think a certian way, he has tryed to equate perez to Hitler but also said he is a man of peace, he has writen a book on how there will never be peace and another on how a 2 state solution is possible. He mis quotes people and makes lots of small factualy incorrect statements hoping no one will realise, just look at his shamefull way of trying to justify his comment of the Jewish highway by talking about Jews in diaspora. Is the M4 a Christian highway?

All Chomsky ever did in his speech was confirm deshowitzs opening statement, pro Israelis welcome a two state solution and pro palestinians are too busy attacking and delagitamizing Israel, something that stands true on this forum.

If he was really interested in the palestinian situation would he not mention how Arafat rejected the camp david accords, it was latter found that the 2nd intifida was pre meditated and planned since before the accord, i mean to belive sharon visting the temple mount caused it would be like beliving that the assasination of arch duke ferdinand was the reason for ww1 rather than an excuse.

What about the arab states who told the palestinians to reject the 1947 partician and attacked israel with in a day of its independence, they blame Israel for not listining to certain UN resolutions when they dont listen to UN Resolution 181 that created the state of Israel.

The balfour decleration promised Jews the whole madate land, they have about 10% of it, the arabs got most of it, its called Jordan now and most Jordanians are palestinians. 800,000 Jews had to flee arab land due to increased persecution in light of 1948, and no one talks of them because Israel absorbed them. 1000's of palestinians died under Egyptian and Jordanian rule but know one cares about that either, they used them as pawns and the palestinian leaders are more interested in trying to beat Israel then to create a state, where do you think it has been said that the palstinians never miss an oppertunity to miss an oppertunity its because every time someone has tryed to spoon feed them peace and an independant state they spit it out again, you try and say its because you make palestinians compramise too much, but lets look at the main points

They dont want to recognise Israel, well why should Israle recognise them if they dont Recognise Israel, not recognising Israel is just another way of saying give us a state but we dont want to accept peace with you.

They want palestinians to have a right of return, well every single palestinian, depsite most are not even desndants of people that lived there before 1948 but actualy came to the camps due to free food, will come back to Israel, firstly its another way of them trying to beat Israel, why would they even need a state, no one is going to stay there if they could go to Israel.

This is cemented with other ridiculous claims such as all of Jurusalem and Bersheva.

Abbas had one point that was actualy reaosnable and that was to decide upon a permanent border now not after the state is created, but Israel simply couldnt do this since it was impossible to do this and keep the palistinians happy with their riduculous claims of major Israeli cities.

He did? That's strangely constructive for Ferrus.
 
 
Planet Chomsky sounds quite appealing.

you have way too much free time!    
 
 
Right wing neocon corporate fascists, religious zealots and the blue rinse brigade tend to despise Chomsky the most.

Those of us who actually know a thing or two about history, law and human rights take a different opinion.

He has taught scores of graduate seminars at the finest institutions in the country, full of students and professors who'd love to take him down a notch. The list of individuals he has debated reads like a whos who of political thinkers and philosophers. Over the course of the last thirty years he has encountered and destroyed the likes of Agamben, Foucault, Derrida, Habermas, Said, Bhabha and Buckley (often in areas far outside his areas of expertise).

And for the record, at 80 years old he could still decimate Hitchens (considered by many to be the top public intellectual alive).
