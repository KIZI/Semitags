Georgia surrounds rebel capital

Georgia says its troops have surrounded the capital of separatist South Ossetia as Russia warns further aggression would lead to retaliation from Moscow.

My Opinion is South Ossetia has a RIGHT to self determination, bravo for Russia to support it!  
 
 
Russia supports self determination? *cough* Chechnya *cough*

What is your opinion on Ingushetia and Chechnya's right to self-determination?

I support it.

Though I apposed Kosovo, as that's an entirely different situation. My stand on Tibet was in support of China. But after careful pondering, I've decided should the majority want self-determination, it should be allowed. But aknowledge not all situations are the same.  
 
 
WW3?

nobody gives that much of a **** about Georgia mate.

OK, so why are you so supportive of Russia in this situation? Surely you can see that it is not intervening with the South Ossetians' best interests at heart, but rather in order to advance its own sphere of influence.
 
 
Hopefully the Russians can crush the Georgians quickly and without bloodshed.

Everyone has the right to self-determination - that does not mean 'nations' can simply secede from larger states when it takes their fancy. You appear to have completely misunderstood the meaning of that right.

Well they support them, which I know is hyporcitical as they have issues with Chechyna. If USA can support Kosovo, to serve their own interests (as with Iraq, Afghanistan) then why can't Russia. Bare in mind USA have issues in regard to Alaska and Texas. Of course not to the same extent we see with Ossetia.

South Ossetia is a province of Georgia that wants to be independent, and has effectively been so since 1990 although it is still technically part of Georgia. Russia wants it to be independent too, so that it can then come under Russian influence, thus weakening Georgia. Recently, tensions in the area have increased, and Georgia and the rebel South Ossetian administration are effectively at war; moreover, the South Ossetians are heavily backed by Russia.

I think that's a reasonable summary...

You're missing out that many South Ossestians are actually Russian citizens and Russia does have an obligation to its citizens.

I didn't ask "has the US ever been guilty of the same thing", I asked why you are so in favour of Russian meddling in Georgian and South Ossetian affairs.

Er, hardly. The Texan and Alaskan independence movements are tiny and insignificant. They don't exercise de facto control over half their claimed territory the way the South Ossetian administration does. Or did until about 48 hours ago, anyway; Tskhinvali seems to be about to fall, unless a lot of Russian tanks suddenly pour over the border.
 
 
BTW - Lib, South Ossetia was never part of Georgia. It's after the collapse of the USSR, it was taken, and that was by force.

An obligation, yes, but that doesn't extend to supporting Russian citizens who are attempting to overthrow a sovereign government. The UK Government would hardly support British expats trying to replace an African government just because they were UK citizens, now would it? See: Mark Thatcher.

I was making a fair point. South Ossetia wants to be affliated with Russia, that's thier perogative!

Putin has already made a statment in regard to that. He's ready.

Isn't the same true of all the ex-Soviet states? They seized the opportunity to grab what they could from the collapse, and bugger the legality of it. That's the outlook that seems to have been dominant, in my view.

Um, no it isn't. If I and my street decide we want to be affiliated with France, does that mean it's OK for the French to give us weapons, for us to declare independence and start killing Britons?

I hope Russia doesn't intervene; but I think it probably will, because the South Ossetians are so hopelessly outweaponed and outnumbered that there's no way they could ever win without Russian help. However, NATO and the US almost certainly won't pile in on Georgia's side because (a) the political will doesn't exist thanks to Iraq and (b) Georgia isn't on their doorstep as it is on Russia's.

Look, you seem to be alien to the concept of not ALL situations are the same. I judge by the individual case, you obviously don't!

Do you not think the fact that Tibet is historically it's own country, and not part of China should have anything to do with it?

(sorry for hijacking your thread)

No, that was illegal - no two ways about it. But at least it had the justification of a difficult constitutional issue, an ethnic conflict and international involvement to support it. Even so, I was against it then and I'm against it now: creating independent nationalists states is usually a way of denying self-determination rather than enhancing it: the way to achieve the latter end is to have an inclusive, multi-cultural state that addresses minority issues instead of issuing declarations of independence.

Last time I checked the Georgian government exercised no sovereign authority over South Osesstia. Claiming land as your own is different to it being soverign land.

Well, what's so different about Georgia's seizure of South Ossetia compared to, say, Moldova's seizure of Transdnistria?

Well it either is or it isn't: if it was 'taken' then it is, surely?

Either way, it is recognised the world over as part of Georgia at the present moment: even Russia must acknowledge that, and before that I believe it was an autonomous region within a Georgian SSR, yes?

Mm, only half true. The Georgian government exercises some, but not total, authority. But again, there are plenty of analogous situations; who exercises full "sovereign authority" over Kashmir? Over Iraq or Afghanistan? Or closer to home, over Chechnya, Ingushetia or Kosovo? If you're going to argue that de facto makes de jure, I think you have a long and complicated hill to climb. Enjoy your Waziristan.

Cool.

I think I'm more in favour of it because Russia supported Serbia over this against the USA. And me being not USA policy friendly, I support this more so because once again the USA are hating this. Condi made a statment, saying Russia should not get involved. Which I found ludicrious, considering how many places they stick their oar in, and do so still.

It is recognised internationally as a part of Georgia: South Ossetia is Georgian, regardless of whether it 'exercises sovereignty' there or not. Indeed, it rather seems to me that putting its army in to quell an insurrection is very definite evidence of sovereign authority being exercised by the central government.
 
 
Saw this coming month’s ago, Russia has been throwing so much money and hardware at South Ossetia that Georgia had to act in some form.

I don’t see Russia getting involved in an open conflict, but if Georgia doesn’t successfully end its operations in quick time this is all going to head south.

Begin a liberation movement then. Though your scenario isn't feasible. As I know of no place that this has occured.

I never cease to be amazed how much people use "the US isn't perfect" as justification for, or rather a distraction from, the misdemeanours of other countries. Iran stones gays? Cry "Gitmo" and run away. Russia tries to undermine the Georgian government's authority? Cry "Kosovo" and run away.

Get this. Just because the US does bad things, doesn't mean it's OK forother countries to do bad things too. It's a playground level of logic.

Yes it was, now they want it back. It's not going to be absorbed by Russia. It'll remain as it is just not part of Georgia.

"Violation of national sovereignty", I hear you cry? Not to mention support for terrorism.

Well, yes and no. Supplying weapons is one thing, but there are only so many South Ossetians to wield them. Georgia still has a big advantage (and in any case, has better weapons than the Soviet crap the South Ossetians are getting). If Russia doesn't want all that support to have been wasted, it will be forced to intervene - protecting its investment, in the time-honoured investors' mistake of not knowing when to cut your losses, piling on greater and greater stakes in order to protect a relatively insignificant initial sum.
 
but if Georgia doesn’t successfully end its operations in quick time this is all going to head south.
 

South? As in, literally south into Loyalist Georgia?

Indeed. But this is a matter Georgia and South O, but as the latter have no military support it's only right Russia wade in. They only have about 70.000 people I read, so if Georgia wanted, they could kill them all and end this conflict quite quickly. (not ideal)

Not officially, perhaps - that sort of thing is a bit unsubtle for this day and age (as those who argue that Iraq has been annexed by the US Empire would happily agree). But it'll go the way of Belarus and in particular Chechnya: Russia in all but name. Tomorrow, Transdnistria...

I just think the costs are too high here, and Russia has missed its window with regards to using the Georgia/South Ossetia situation to its advantage regarding Kosovo and Chechnya.

Georgia has a massive advantage in conventional arms, but unless they can capitalize on this advantage very quickly they will have (the owe so popular) insurgency on their hands, especially if Russia decides to finance one.

Er, Georgian forces will take Tskhinvali. Like I said, short of a massive Russian incursion there's effectively nothing that can stop them. Holding it might be a different matter.
 
 
Ossetians want independnce just as Georgians wanted it from Russians. Why the resistence eh.

What costs? Russia is the regional Great Power, and it knows nobody will stand in its way. I can see where you're coming from - and I rather hope you're right and I'm wrong - but I think direct Russian intervention in some form is inevitable. I mean, they've already got all those CIS "peacekeepers", ie Russian regulars, sitting there; a couple of them were killed the other day by a Georgian missile hitting their barracks, so there's your casus belli.

The S O holding out from Georgia, or Georgia holding onto it?

Realistically the SO have no chance against Georgia, Tskhinvali isn’t a very defensible position and its not big enough to give many policing problems (if properly garrisoned, which I think it will be.)

Saakashvili acted like Hitler, first stating that Georgia wants peace and 3 hours later attacking sleeping civilians at the eve of Olympic Games. Russia has sent in troops.

For the same reason Russia opposed Georgian independence: The preservation of national sovereignty.

The rights and wrongs of the mass secession from the USSR are in the past. Maybe Georgia shouldn't be independent, but the fact is that it is. And that's the issue here: We are dealing with what is, not with what should be.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev vowed that Moscow will protect Russian citizens.

"In accordance with the constitution and the federal law, I, as president of Russia, am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of Russian citizens wherever they are located," Medvedev said in televised remarks. "We won't allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished."

I just don’t see the objective. I mean they can’t annex Georgia, the international community would go crazy, not to mention the Georgian people!

So what, they 'free' S.O. and have them as a puppet? This will weaken Georgia, but I think this would also force Georgia (not to mention other nations in the area) further into Americas hands. Russia wants influence in Georgia, and conducting any form of overt action will have the opposite effect.

Having said all that, Russia could give up on trying to win Georgia and instead seek too make an example out of them... That is a worrying thought!

Indeed. I think the main objective here is one of pride, actually - there's little else to be gained from bringing S.O. back into the Russian fold, but it will bolster Russian patriotism, which has as we all know been smarting since 1990.

Bit like the Georgia and S.O...

Just to get back on track, if Russia did throw some troops into S.O, what do you think the response from the international community would be?

Personally I think unless Russia start rolling into other Georgian territory (other than S.O) the international community will just use some harsh words and then chip off early for a game of tennis, how about you?

"Boo hoo we condemn this horrible nasty act". Standard Millibandry and nothing more. That's exactly why Russia is at liberty to do what the hell it likes here, up to a point; the West has expended all its political capital on Iraq and Afghanistan, and to a lesser extent Kosovo, leaving little for things like this that arguably matter more in some ways.

Nail. Head.
 
 
Today Russian troops have moved into the region on South Ossetta in northern Georgia. The Georgian PM has called for help from the USA.

Should Britain be worried about this? If the US were to come to the aid of Georgia then Britain would undoubtedly be drawn into the battle aswell, as allies of America.

Our relations with Russia are already low at this time, would it really be beneficial to Britain to get involved in this battle that really doesn't concern us?

You'd have thought that WWI would have shown us how a dispute between two small nations (eg. Serbia and Austria-Hungary) can escalate into something much bigger when other countries get themselves involved. I hope that the US and the UK have more sense than to make this mistake again!

Ok, so Russia is actually sending more soldiers into S.O and calling them peace keepers, clearly there is no peace to keep!

After doing some more digging many believe Russia is actually going to try and defend Tskhinvali from Georgian troops, which is news to me!

Im getting more and more worried about all this!

  that seems to be his stance.

This action really sends a message to NATO and the US. No one is going to support expansion of the alliance to a nation and region where it may actually have to called upon to invoke its mandate of mutual defense.

The political balance of forces in Central Asia may just be in the balance if this conflict does not end soon.

But boy do I wish I had been wrong. "Moscow sending the tanks in" is the sort of phrase that should stay firmly in the past where it belongs.

Everyone knew the Caucasus was unstable before this. I think perhaps Georgia took the gamble that the world would too preoccupied with the Olympics to pay attention to this conflict, giving them a few weeks to end it. I'm not sure if that was a smart decision on their part.

 

Regrettably I think you're right.

And what of the ramifications for Georgian-Western relations? Whatever the facts underlying it, this is going to look very much like a Western betrayal in Tbilisi.

Hmm, OK - not sure there's that much to talk about there, though. Russian expats and Georgian expats will fight on the streets, I suppose, but there aren't many of either so it won't affect us much. The price of oil and gas will probably jump, David Milliband will come out with some insipid piece of flummery as the Government's Official Position, some unlucky diplomats might be expelled and Alexander Litvinenko's glowing corpse will do another lap of the media circuit.

So do you think there is no chance of the US getting involved in the conflict?

I know I shouldn’t expect much from the Russian's, but it just all seems a bit cheap.

On the other hand, it's not like Georgia can rely on anyone else to reclaim these territories over the long term. I think what is more likely is the overthrow of Saakashvili (whether through constitutional means or not) if this goes badly enough.
 

It's a likely consequence, yes. Saakashvili will probably go and Georgia will follow him down the pan.

Lose a battle? Fire all your generals and wonder why you go on to lose the war. It's one of the oldest political mistakes there are.
 
 
The US won't get involved, never ever ever. They've let Russia do as they please in Chechnya long enough, so I fail to see why Georgia would be much different? It's sad to say but Georgians are worthless to us and there would be nothing to gain financially or politically from fighting with Russia on their behalf that makes it worth their while.

What's new?
 

Well, quite. But coupled with rampant anti-Americanism it allows countries such as Russia to couch invasion in terms of "peacekeeping", just as China calls the oppression of ethnic minorities "anti-terrorism".

America has given the world's, shall we say, "differently free" countries a whole bundle of fun new words and catchphrases to play with.
 
 
Can't we just let them fight it out and then come in and claim the reminants for the Empire?

None. It and the West in general have blown their political capital on Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. Now, you might argue that the latter two were justified, but the fact remains that the political will just isn't there. After all, Georgia isn't on America's doorstep the way it is on Russia's. It's simply not worth Uncle Sam's while.
 
 
I'm very much a Russian patriot, but in this case it would be laughable to claim that there is a reason for Russian involvement other than its hatred of Georgia.

Mind you, I think it's very unlikely that Russia will take any military action, and provided that doesn't happen a bit of pressure on Georgia is no bad thing. Saakashvili is a prick who just wants increased status on the international stage and is constantly looking for a fight with Russia - accusing it of fictional air raids, spying, sabotage etc. - to boost his case for acceptance into NATO. He is in no way representative of the wishes of his people.
 
 
It seems the Georgians killed several Russian troops there on peacekeeping duties. If I was Russia I'd be pissed off too.

How about the Georgian artillery killing Russian troops in the area on peacekeeping duties? Is that cause for Russia to send in more troops?

watch the us media on this one, russia will be framed as the red menace - fox news already captioned images of georgians shelling an ossetian city as "russians shell georgian military base"

Ah, but it's not drawing them in, is it? Because they're not getting involved! In any case, I don't think assurances like that are ever taken seriously. I'm willing to bet that most alliances include a clause to the effect that "we won't make trouble for you or waste your time fighting our wars". But nobody actually believes a word of it.
 
I don't think Georgia will fall apart, but this is going to devastate its economy.
 

Yes, if either Saakashvili falls or Russia crosses the Rubicon. Or both, because obviously the latter would make the former a certainty.
 
It goes back to at least the 1400s.
 

I'll believe you. There's something of a gap in my knowledge from about 1000 up to 1830ish. And don't say "that's because that's the times you're awake between"

But honestly, that's ridiculous. Surely that now means there's no going back and Russia and Georgia are at war. When was Russia last at war with an actual country?! Not counting Chechnya as a proper country...

(That's a rhetorical question. I know the answer is Afghanistan)

With regard to  #88 , I just checked: Saakashvili said any Russian incursions would result in a state of war, so I assume no formal declaration is now required - as with Britain and Germany in 1939, all that is needed is for one party to satisfy the stated criteria, in this case Russia entering Georgia. That box is now ticked, ergo a state of war exists. I think.

Certainly have - but it's Russian:  www.lenta.ru  again. You can trust it though, it's essentially the Russian equivalent of the BBC. And you'll just have to trust my translation, but don't worry, my Russian is perfect.

 http://www.lenta.ru/news/2008/08/08/bolnisi/ 
'As the result of a raid carried out by Russian planes against the Georgian Marneuli air base, several Georgian service personnel have been injured and several planes have been destroyed. (N.B. Russia is not disputing the validity of this information). In addition to this, the Georgian Foreign office is claiming that the Russian air force has also carried out a strike against the Georgian airfield in Bolnisi.'

In addition to that,this
 http://lenta.ru/articles/2008/08/08/ossetia/ 
is a page that constantly updates the course of events in real time, in a 'who shot who' level of detail, every few minutes. It's by far the best place for live updates on the internet, way ahead of all the other sites. Again, it's obviously in Russian, but you can try pasting the latest posts into a translator, you'll get the general gist. Note the times are Moscow time, i.e. 3 hours ahead of us. And it might be quite slow to load as it's constantly being updated. Not to mention it's a popular page right now.
For example, the latest update is that the Russian 58th army has crushed Georgian resistance in areas where Russian 'peacekeepers'
(I'll put it in inverted commas to keep you happy) were being attacked.
 
 
What a gross overjudgement; WW3?
 
 
For around 150 Years until 1990, Georgia was a part of Russia. Its withdrawal was from the Soviet Union, and truth be told its been standing on a bit of a shody limb. Its ethnically mixed, with lots of Russians, and Georgians have been 'Russian' for a quite a while. Joseph Stalin was 'Georgian' for heaven's sake.

The US maybe a paper ally of Georgia, but they aren't going to make an enemy out of Russia this time.

Georgia is a Western ally and a prospective NATO member, there are also one thousand US personal in Georgia and the moment and Georgia has troops in Iraq. If potentially a US serviceman was killed then all hell would break loose.

What the hell is going on? Why haven't I heard about this earlier?
 
 
I sense another World War...
 
 
Oh dear. I wonder if Russia will take the opportunity to annexe Abkhazia as well? It's a little bit akin to the annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938. What's revealing is that Medvedev hasn't really said anything, it's all been the Russian 'Prime Minister'.

That said, this isn't an excuse for another World War. You lot think the United States wants to engage in a conflict with barely 4 months left of a second-term presidency? Not on your nelly. There'll be some hand waving in the Security Council and Russia will say that it's looking after "it's own" in a spurious way. Then again, perhaps if Russia called it Operation South Ossetian Freedom it'd be alright. Hell, Putin would love to dance ontop of a tank, right???
 
 
I am watching a Russian news channel "Vesti" and RussiaToday right now and it looks like Russia will intervene soon! Russian citizens are in real danger!

Interesting piece Bismarck; although the use of the word 'terrorist' irks me somewhat. It doesn't really imply a balanced sense of journalism. The other article there on the Medvedev - Putin split provided for some interesting back-politics on the Russian side too.

Cheers for the website as well. Will bookmark it and keep a track.

The photograph was probably taken at a summit meeting; besides, photographs in journalism are used for specific effect. It is a clear reminder that the Georgian President is a friend of the EU and a friend of the West. Politics, my friend, politics.

No, there's a news video of him speaking about this very issue today, with an EU flag behind him.

I just find it a bit strange of him pulling the EU in this.
 
 
I was about to say, actually, that it does largely appear that Russia is actually attacking the Georgian army, and not civvies.

Well, then, for the same reason I suggested above. Georgia wants powerful friends, the EU is reasonably well placed to 'talk' to Russia and mediate because, after all, it is not the US. Perhaps Angela Merkel would be in a good position to lead the negotiations because of her working relationship with Moscow. I think the British should stay well out of it, after all we've pissed off the Russians somewhat recently.
 
 
Russian peacekeepers are being killed and captured

more than 1,400 Ossetians are dead

the majority of Ossetians are passport-carrying Russian citizens

I'm open to any sources that I can read. English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, etc.

"The BBC, for example, are reporting Moscow as saying:

"more than 10 of its peacekeeping troops in South Ossetia had been killed and 30 wounded in the Georgian offensive. At least 15 civilians are also reported dead."

 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7548715.stm 

It would be interesting to compare news stories as they're being developed to gain an overall picture.

-------------------------
Edit: Le Monde are saying the following:

Le président sud-ossète, Edouard Kokoïty, a affirmé à l'agence russe Interfax que 1 400 personnes étaient mortes dans les combats..."

 http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article...ens_id=1036786 

Basic translation - Edward Kokoity, president of South Ossetia, has told the Russian Newsagency Interfax that 1400 people have been killed in the fighting.

I think that's a bit strong. There are, unquestionably, certain countries which Russia (both the government and the people) feels betrayed by on a basic - intuitive and emotional - level, for breaking away from it at the moment it was weakest, taking with them a considerable part of the infrastructure it had invested in them, and proclaiming their undying love for the West. You have admit that's understandable. These countries are chiefly the Baltic States, Ukraine and Georgia. As such, there is no question that now that it has regained some of its strength, it is trying to squeeze them in every way possible - from cyber-attacks to economic measures using its position in the energy market. And there is also no question that it will take every opportunity to use any internal crisis in any of these countries to its own advantage. That's exactly what's happened here - they've seen an opportunity to get rid of or at least seriously weaken Saakashvili, who they hate. Nobody in Russia is fooling themselves that this is a peacekeeping measure, I can assure you.

But speaking of instability in this particular scenario, your comment is hardly fair. Clearly Georgia has done far more to make the situation unstable than Russia. Their government has taken a region in an obviously Russian sphere of influence, where the vast majority of the population still has very strong ties with Russia and feel part of it (in Ossetia most are Russian citizens in fact). They have then proceeded to set an aggressive course for joining NATO and Europe, trying to pick a fight with Russia at every opportunity. How is that encouraging stabilty? Even if Saakashvili claims he is trying to create democracy (which he isn't - human rights are infringed way more in Georgia than in Russia), democracy is about giving people better lives, not something you achieve at all costs just for the sake of it. It's a means to an end, not an end in itself. As such, Georgia's actions have been a pure provocation throughout, and Russia deserves only a small portion of the blame for the current instability.

EDIT: I'm not the neg repper lol.

If Russia didn't actively encourage South Ossetian and Abkhazian separatism, there would be no need for Georgia to attempt to reclaim its own territory. The passport claim is ludicrous. The passports were given after Russia helped the two territories achieve de facto independence as a way ensuring that Georgia doesn't attempt to reclaim them. It would be akin to America giving every Scotsman American citizenship, encouraging Scotland to declare independence, and then send in American troops to protect the Scots if England decided to do something about it.

 

I prefer the scenario where America gives its passports to Canadians in case Britain tries to reclaim its former colonies.

Huzzah.
Err, concerning the actual conflict, I really don't think there's sufficient information to conduct a proper analysis. From what it sounds like, the Georgians struck out first and Russia simply came in to defend it's S.O allies. The suggested strikes on areas out of the warzone... well. It would be understandable if that was limited to purely airbases, however the fact that there are reports of attacks on civillian villages unrelated to SO casts doubts - although I can't find any evidence backing these claims.

Did you happen to catch the Dimbelby programme on Russia that was on recently? His interviews with young Russians in Petersburg revealed a distinct distaste for democracy, which is telling given the more Westernised attitudes of Petersburg [including in its origins!]. That sort of politic is even more pronounced in the Russian countryside, where belief in spirits is more widespread and strong leaders are common in folklore.

Best books on this in recent years (in English) I think are:

Geoffrey Hosking, Rulers & Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union (London, 2006)

Margaret Paxson, Solovyovo: The Story of Memory in a Russian Village (Bloomington, Indiana, 2005)

Catherine Merridale, Night of Stone: Death and Memory in Russia (London, 2000)

Really do bring out the resiliance of a strong leader figure in Russian nation-mythology. In this regard, not being a Russian speaker has its drawbacks since I can't engage in the same kinds of work that these historians and anthropologists do but they do hit upon similar types of conclusions so something must be consistent.

I have often wondered whether this has had a telling impact upon the distaste for (Western-style) democracy in Russia?

No, it's just that Russian professors often take bribes...their salaries aren't US$200,000.

Plus, Medvedev talked about bring in more foreign professors in order to bring new ideas/ teaching methods into the country. In turn, this should work to imrove global recognition.

anyway, cant belive they lauch the military operation and kill ppl at the day of Olympic opening ceremony...
 
 
 
No they won't, russia and china are very close allies, if they're going to, which IMO is BS, they'd wait.
Edit: i just looked at the guardian site and apparently both sides have been bombing, but it'd never be a real war anyway.

You don't "have to be like in the Western world". Basic human rights e.g. the right to life, freedom from cruel and usual punishment and etc are universal human rights that transcend civilizations. It just happens to be the case that the countries which most strongly adhere to such principles - at least within their borders, happen to be Western countries.
 
 
Russia have sent in some tanks. Hardly qualifies as war yet.

Although we haven't had a big war in Europe of nigh on 60 years so maybe it will "kick off" if the US go to Georgia's ad (which I doubt)
 
 
Oh. My. God.

I am so tired of Russia being villianised: you are aware that they do have good arguments on their side, yes?

The regional conflict that I think you speak of has also American interventionist roots, etc. Russia cannot be blamed for this conflict, nor can they be blamed for supporting a close ally. Furthermore, this ally is an autonomous region aiming to earn freedom: shouldn't Westerners be for this freedom-driven idea?

I'm more concerned with the whole China - Taiwan - America deal, I need to find out what's going on. I'm so behind on my world wars.
:hurries to reuters:
 
 
It pisses me off how the Western media constantly accuse Russia of being evil, war mongering, etc. Actually, Russia are simply preventing Geogia from waging genocide on the people from the break-away state of South Ossetia; yet the American-led, British media wouldn't dare tell you that.

It's no different to what the Americans claimed to do going into Iran. Americans are such ****ing hypocrites, it really pisses me off. By warped American logic, the Russians are simply "defending freedom". The more the media tells out right lies about Russia, then more my respect grows for Russia; it seems to be a level-headed nation, unlike others, mentioning no names, of course!
 
 
I thought it was Georgia that started with the hostile action by killing some Russian soldiers in South Ossetia and trying to take the territory back? Russia are just responding because of the deaths...

Or is this wrong? The news websites say so many different things...

If anybody is interested this is what the UK news channels are saying

"Georgia's national security council says the Georgian president is going to declare a state of emergency and Martial Law in the next few hours" According to Sky News.

"Georgia's national security council says the Russian's are bombing civilian targets" According to BBC News.

Showing Georgia as the victims. I've not really followed it, so I'm not really sure so everything I said could be rubbish.
 
 
russia dont like us atm. russia needs to be stopped! stuff the moral/intellectual approach its them or us!!!

they support iran, they are holding us to ransome with their gas, they are forcing british business out of russia, they are all together not acting in our interests.

If we play "who has the moral high ground" i think youll find no one does...
 
 
Convenient how many people forget that Russia used to be the Soviet Union not long ago.
 
 
It's not really a "war" is it? I also very much doubt it will escalate to the extent of western intervention (SC maybe as far as it goes). I also don't see the problem of it being on the day of the Olympic ceremony. If Russia wants to support an ally, they should do so as soon as they can.
 
 
Georgia have one of the best equipped armies in the Baltics. They have (unlike the Russians) fully equipped units who are well trained.

They should be able to hold their own for a while at least.

No I think US F-22's will be downing your Migs in the dozens, bare in mind the US has several airbases in the region and the Reagan Carrier Battle Group in the Caspian Sea and B-2 bombers at Diego Garcia.

Russia's airforce would be ****ed if it went against the USAF. Georgia is asking for the US to airlift its troops back to Georgia from Iraq now.

Chechyna must be governed by Russia, cos otherwise it would get lost. South Ossetia is different, since it knows that it has somewhere to go which is russia. Once it reaches mother russia, it should be freed from the self determination.

Ì don`t know about everything the Russian military has and I especially have no idea what the US has up its sleeve. The only way we can ever find out for sure is if they both reach a point of no return and start using everything that can be useful to them. Then, and only then...

I think the Russian military budget is probably on par with Britain's. Obviously, the US budget is astronomical and dwarfs the rest of the world.
 
 
It's actually about half:

False pretemces yes but its a little different. Russia has invaded Georgia because it wants to destroy it and if recent reports are to be believed has began targetting civilians.

As much as I also despise the US, I don't believe they are/were trying to destroy Iraq.

Do you deliberately choose the unpopular sides in conflicts?

Its more on who can conduct a first strike first and the US and NATO can do that easily with our Trident II SLBM's and combined with nuclear JSOW's launched from B-2's then the US could safely wipe out 90% of Russia's nuclear arsenal leaving Russia to target only counter-value targets i.e. cities and civilian populations which if they did would mean retaliation against Russian cities.

I'm not as pathetic as yourself and others, to jump on the bandwagon of those percieved to be the 'winning' side. I see a conflict, I see who is behind it, and what the reason is, and I support it on that merit.

Russia has not invaded anything, these are biased reports by CNN, BBC.

Russia has tried peaceful means of debate with them, but lastnight Georgia killed civillians. That's not an issue to somebody as cretinious as you, but to me it matters.

The US invades a country with a radical dictator, Russia invades country with a stable democracy, which just happens to have a territory seeking independence, a territory which would be quite peaceful if it wasn't for Russian intervention.

How you can compare these two things is beyond me.

No, you are correct. Georgia started violent action on the Georgia/South Ossetia border a few days ago. Any response by the Russian government was due to South Ossetia's cry for help from their ally. They did not randomly barge in, going about shooting at civilian targets.

Furthermore, Georgia was targeting civilian targets as well: they were shooting at the multi-level flats that stand at the border. That's as civilian as it gets.

No Russia haven't invaded anything, because Georgia isn't a recognised state.....

Add Sky news, reuters and the AFP to the list of biased reporters - you do like accusing the media of being biased don't you.

Russia has also killed civilians, but I suppose that was accidental after being forced to fire?

If a group of people don't want to bow down to the ruling majority, then their peaceful subjugation is not a peacful life I believe the said group would prefer.
 
 
Reuters isn't biased, not from what I read. They've mentioned Russian peacekeepers are killed by Georgia, and Russia has had to act. This was on the BBC News report.

I'm not disputing that, its hard to get facts during a war but your claim that russia hasn't invaded is laughable.
 
 
I can't even comment on all of this.  

I...wow.

You do realise that the chances of this turning into the level that you have been warning of are slim? Such regional conflicts, backed by larger, more powerful governments for idealogical means aren't exactly uncommon...

Which publication have you being using to get your information? On which merits did you decide which newsgroups were biased, and which weren't?

The BBC reports I read seemed fairly unbiased. There was comments from both sides of the border (i.e. Russians and Georgians) as well as comments from the people living within South Ossetia itself. I also didn't notice the reporters leaking in any of their own opinions. In fact, the article has more quotes from the Russian president than quotes from Georgians.

I should make it clear, that since I've only read the BBC reports so far, I haven't actually taken a 'side', since I have insufficient information, so I'm not replying to you because of your pro-Russia stance. I am however interested to find out why you believe the BBC's reporting on this to be biased?

I don't think the BBC has been biased. Its just a tactic people who "support" the "unpopular" side use to justify their stance.

So far both the UN and NATO have failed, or waivered, in declaring a consensus over potential action as a result of the conflict. Equally, the US has been quite guarded in outwardly throwing their weight into the arena. Certainly, Russian forces would likely win a conventional conflict against Georgian forces in the region, but it's highly unlikely that other NATO forces would support Georgia in its defence; consider that, over the 'Zimbabwe issue' recently, UN and NATO members were unanimous in urging a diplomatic solution. To offer troops this early in another conflict, just weeks later, would raise more than a few eyebrows. Perhaps, because it's "closer to home", it may influence some European states to offer some form of support, but it's unlikely that they would do so outside of NATO or the EU (that is, they would not 'act alone').

However, that doesn't rule out the possibility that the US will support Georgia by proxy : as an Americanising influence in the region, the US are likely to offer logistical, strategic and financial support under the veil of previous diplomatic agreements (i.e., Georgia's NATO application). I doubt they'll hesitate for long in shipping Georgian units from Iraq.

It's interesting to note that both Russian and American rhetoric seems to be saying similar things: i.e., protecting regional 'integrity'. Ultimately, it boils down to the same "regional problem" that "Great Russia" has been dealing with throughout the 1980s onwards (that is, greater regional autonomy rubbing against the Kremlin's centralising bent). One academic of note has observed that it's the very fact that there are many Great Russians' within CIS nations -a conscious product of Soviet Russification- that will provide the catalyst for conflict in the future. That's been confirmed by the Kremlins' promise to protect "Russian citizens" wherever they may be found.

Equally, it makes me wonder whether or not Georgia will take the opportunity to 'wrest' back Abkhaz territory in the same sweep: there's still a lot of bitterness between Georgia and the Abkhaz region, where many resent the historic influence of 'Georgianization' (i.e., Georgian language teaching, as one indicator of this relationship) up until the 1980s, and the economic/political monopoly had by many Georgians up until now. Perhaps, with Russian military support in-the-field, both Abkhaz and Ossetian territories will declare greater actual autonomy from Gerogia (more-so than the 1992 settlement gave them).

You said "Russia didn't invade". They did. I know they had a reason for it, whether it was a good reason or not is debatable.
 
 
Haven't read the thread but just wanted to say OP, no wonder you are in the red. WW3, honestly? Yes... in that case.

WW3! - Iran and USA
WW3! - Russia and USA
WW3! - Israel and Iran

and so on.

I'm not sure who to support in this madness. I suppose I am more inclined towards Georgia, as Russia will just take this opportunity to gain political leverage on South Ossetia and I think given the context it is rather unfair.

Also 26,500 troops versus 680,000 (approximately) is hardly fair game, so it would be suicidal for Georgia to call a full blown war against Russia.

Why are you so sure about the news that is updated every few minutes? How accurate can it be with bullets flying over reporters' heads?

I have also seen many reports without bullets flying over reporters heads (not that I said it was 100% accurate anyway, all I said is Russia invaded and I have seen video evidence to prove that).

Russian forces battle Georgians

Russia engages in fierce clashes in Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia region, reports say, amid fears of all-out war.

Why can't it say Georgian forces battle Russians? BBC makes it seem as if Russian soldiers are fiercely killing Georgian civilians without actually saying it.

After the colapse of the soviet empire and the emergence of the rupublics of the ex-soviet states, russia has been atepting to reconsolidate. Remeber chechnya, the soviets leveled it and quashed that uprising by force. I fear the same type thing is going to happen in Georgia. Luckily they are not members of the UN yet or this could seriously spark ww3. This is a big deal and it will have to handled with care. Georgia is a soveriegn country whether russia recognizes that or not. They are not subservient to russia and they don't owe them anything, This invasion cannot be tolerated.

Hopefully UK, France, Germany, US etc will do nothing as this would only escalate the situation at present.

The only thing that we should do is to allow people to volunteer to fight, rather like what happened did in Croatia, Kosovo and in the Spanish Civil War for example.

However, I don't know if the 'war' if it will indeed become one will go on long enough for this to happen.

Thats ridiculous, they would get slaughtered. I don't know how this can be resolved peacefully as neither side seems to be interested in stopping but encouraging people to fight, especially in a war they can't possible win, isn't the answer.

Admittedly I don't have much of an idea of military tactics, but I fail to see how Georgian volunteers could win a war against Russia.

And UGeNe, using the Iraqi war as an example of creating stability isn't a great example.

Yes for 3 reasons:
1). Volunteers would do it out of their own conciousness and we would not have to account for them.
2). Regular troops would just aggravate a political situation between NATO and Russia
3). We don't have enough troops to send to the region anyway.

Well, it has been done before. In Kosovo for example there were large groups of volunteers, many from the UK.

Also a classic big country versus small force is the Vietnam War.

Hypocrisy at its finest!

They support South Ossetia right to independence but object to Kosovo and Chechnya having the right to self determination.

Don't be fooled by both sides.

South Ossetia has been de facto independent since 91' - the new Georgian president is just trying to cause a fray and ease his passage into Nato and get their support.

Do not believe for one second that Russia is doing this to support the SOs. They are doing it to cause a rammy - show their muscle and intimidate the EU and NATO for supporting Georgia.
Like I said above, if Russian are showing support for them then why objects to Kosovo and Chechnya?

This is old business dressed in new clothes - stuff that should have been done and dusted after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Both sides are trying to score points domestically and internationally.

It's ridiculous volunteers will be target practice for trained well-equipped soldiers.

Plus, don't forget that Russia has mandatory military service, which used to be 2 years a couple of years ago (now, it's was changed to 1 year), so Russia has a large pool of soldiers

1). If a country encourages its citizens to fight in a foreign war-zone which they do not believe is important enough to warrant official army support, then I would say that they very much do have to account for them.

2). True, this is a good argument for not sending troops in.

3). Again, this is a good argument for not sending troop in.

Really do bring out the resiliance of a strong leader figure in Russian nation-mythology. In this regard, not being a Russian speaker has its drawbacks since I can't engage in the same kinds of work that these historians and anthropologists do but they do hit upon similar types of conclusions so something must be consistent.

I have often wondered whether this has had a telling impact upon the distaste for (Western-style) democracy in Russia?

 

Yeah, it's the same in China to an extent. They don't want to be free, it seems. Or at any rate, they don't yet; possibly they will once a middle class has arisen and become reasonably powerful. That's arguably how we got there in the West.

You're right that the leader-dominated approach is a very Russian thing - small wonder every form of government Russia tries, be it Socialism or democracy, rapidly flips back into a dictatorship.

They backed the Georgians in taking control over Adzharia just so that it could be built. Russia on the other hand want as much influence over their ex soviet neighbours as possible because they sit on so much natural resources and Russia wants as much of it as possible to flow though Russia.

This is also the reason why you won't see anyone in the west trying to "bring freedom" to Azerbaijan, despite the elections being about as corrupt as Zimbabwe, since the pipeline also runs through there.

The Georgian president (who is a CIA man) is getting out of control and trying to deal with S. Ossetia the same as Adzharia.

I don't think the US or UK would intervene for S. Ossetia, the Georgian army have been trained by the US to deal with such things as this. BUT If Russia, or any rebels groups, set foot in Georgian controlled areas or anywhere near the pipeline our troops will be in there so fast it would make your head spin.

And gimme a break about the self determination stuff, no one, neither the pro-Russia people or anti-Russia people, gives a **** about S. Ossetia and never has.

Perhaps this is coincidence, but this doesn't seem to say limited strategic value to me.
 
 
There is a theory about NATO encirclement of Russia, which includes the colour revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia, the missile defence in Poland, the central asian bases and even the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions. Some people might say it goes beyond something more than pet projects and is really part of the cold war endgame.

The vietnam war was completely different to this. I'm not sure about kosovo but a group of barely armed Georgian volunteers will not defeat the Russian army.

No, it more than likely would have been blown out of the sky, but Georgia's doctrine has always been too hustle an invaders air force so the its ground forces could take less punishment.

Seems like the Russian's got the Georgians on the ground, bit of a cock up there.

As far as I've understood it, the Georgian military claimed that (as of last night) four Russian fighters had been downed by ground-fire. Presumably this is an exaggeration, including any incidents where there may have been a hit (i.e., not a confirmed 'downing'). Equally, I'd heard that this was over Georgian territory, where Russia did confirm that they had been conducting bombing operations.

Yes, put words in my mouth. I know that's the best you can do.

Russia is not a completely different country from what it was 20 years ago. It's moving, yet again, towards authoritarianism, and it's growing stronger and more belligerent for every day that passes. Russia is not a cuddly little bear as people, like you, seem to think (same can be said about Iran and China).

And oh, have you already forgot about the little dirty war next door? The, what's it called, Chechen War. My, my. What a teddy bear, eh?
 
 
the russians are doing right in defending the territory and the people of the region, however at risk of stepping over the line by attacking georgian towns and bases miles away from south ossetia.

Russia have had a thousand peacekeepers in the region for years, they have given russian passports to its people, an independent region with no international recognition, no doubt russia have been trying to help the south ossetia for some time because they are a pain to Georgia, a Georgia who have strong links to the US, the west and want to be part of NATO, something russians cant stand in their backyard.

But Georgia are full scale invading which is totally out of line, these people fought for the right to be free in 1992, now Georgia wants them back. Lets not go down the moscow media of attempted "ethnic cleansing" though.

The world stands around saying "everyone stop fighting, peace, peace"

then there is the american leaders saying "get out Russia"

its an absolute joke, cold war 2 because of a combination of Russia's policies towards those around them and ensuring they dont become like the west and the typical yanks anti commies, ignorance and such.

Nothing will happen from anyone else in the world, once Russia have control global talks will take effect, but there will never be peace in this region under Georgian rule, its too late to just stop now, its began, recognised independence or russian rule is all that will be good for the people of these areas. Georgia are in the wrong, they are the invaders, will the US recognise and accept this, i think not, they could never swallow their pride and agree with russia.

These people dont want to be part of Georgia, they are ethnically different, so why should Georgia be allowed to bomb them and invade them, claim to invest in the region if they just become part of their nation, very old school, no surprise of eastern europe, we've been seeing it in Kosovo's independence, land means more than peace in this part of the world, nationalism is far too prominent.

It all depends on how many troops Russia send in.

I don't know a huge amount about the Vietnam war, but I understand a lot of it took place in the jungles where the vietnamese were skilled at guerilla warfare. In Georgia it is just one army against another with, as far as I know, neither having a terrain advantage. (Someone who knows more may want to correct that though?).

The vietnamese army also had the support of the vietnamese people, something Georgia hasn't got.

To anyone who says this is not a war "The Georgian parliament has meanwhile approved a presidential decree declaring a state of war for 15 days. " from :  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7550804.stm 

Once again the US and Russia are using proxies for a mini war. America supplying arms and intelligence for Georgia, Russia supplying arms and military support for South Ossetia. Sad occurrence for all those civilians caught up in this.

There is as much oil in the caucuses as there is in Saudi Arabia. Russia has to move now on Georgia before it ascends to NATO. If it does then the NATO clause about attacks on their members will mean Georgia becomes untouchable and then it will be too late.

How true is that these days? Would NATO really send the cavalry in in such a situation?

Also, regarding oil - that may be true, I don't know, but it's surely harder and therefore more expensive to extract, otherwise Georgia would be a rich OPEC country already. I'm guessing the Caucasus is like the Alaskan reserves in that it won't be cost-effective to exploit until the price of oil has gone quite a long way up even from its present level.

Not really. The Georgians just weren't banking on such a hammer-blow from Russia, that's all; but from what I can tell the Russian Air Force hardly had to lift a finger to gain total air superiority. Which means it's looking grim for Georgia.

Damn, and after all that hard work training the Georgian army just to take control over it and get the pipeline built. The Georgian president has really screwed up this time, he took the bait and now the whole thing is falling apart.

Well, the even more fundamental thing is that when Stalin was younger and training for the priesthood he used to be quite proud of his Georgian heritage.

The other key point about Abkhazia is that it was for a while an independent Soviet Republic (in the 1920s) because Stalin sought to teach the Georgian Communist Party (i.e. a Menshevik Party) a few lessons about the importance of loyalty to the Bolshevik cause. The same, indeed, goes for South Ossetia. The Menshevik Georgians invade both and it was only the intervention of the CPSU(b) that enabled independent Abkhazia to form.

As Robert Service notes in his biography of Stalin:

"They [the Georgian CP] insisted that the Abkhazians were a Georgian tribe despite the fact that their language is entirely unrelated" (p.205.)

As far as I understand it Abkhazian isn't related much to Russian either so this is a case of politics over any other ties.

The incorporation of civilians into war has been a feature of numerous conflicts right through history. It would be difficult to hold a moral high ground there even if a government wanted to. It doesn't take a genius historian to cite Dresden for example and point to Western hypocrisy on that score.

Deplorable, yes, but unfortunately such things are in the nature of modern warfare.

Well yes indeed but much of Georgia's claim on these lands is also based on historical inclusion in Georgia so I was trying to see a good reason why Russia would have gotten involved in that sort of a context as well as looking for a parallel demonstration of might over the same region.

It's moving against towards authoritarianism because the shock therapy in the 1990s caused rampant corruption, high criminal activity, and two economic collapses.

Though corruption is still commonplace in Russia, no longer do I fear getting shot during mafia proceedings. There is a level of stability that has been reached due to centralization. I do not think that Russia is cuddly bear, by far, nor do I think it should be. Were it a nation that did not have global interests that were being stepped on, it could do well to sit quietly. However, NATO's interests often collide with that of Russia. Furthermore, NATO's interests too often align solely with that of America's. I prefer the international arena to be less unilateral. I do not agree with everything that Russia does, but I understand the reasoning and logic behind it.

If you cite the lack of free and fair elections that has been seen, I must agree that I find that worrying. However, I think that there are trends towards worrying authoritarianism, not authoritarianism in place. There is growing control on the media, but not complete control. As a citizen and someone who has lived there, I must mention that there are a number of radical newspapers and television programs available, that do not experience any sort of government control and censorship that I can see. Yes, there is some censorship, but the Western media villianizes this aspect of the Russian Federation, not mentioning the censorship in America - the West's so-called, oft-mentioned ideal.

The Chechen War is a war with long historical roots. There is more to it than simple territory.

A couple of years ago Putin retrieved troops from that region, simply keeping the basis on the border. The result was a serious of terrorist attacks on the region. Hence, troops were once again brought in.

Chechnya isn't exactly cuddly either.

I disagree. Take your own reasoning a step further - what purpose is there in retaining leverage over Georgia? Georgians will resent it, and it will be costly and bothersome. The only thing that could make that worthwhile is the prestige factor - the pride associated with Russia's asserting itself on the world stage not just economically or defensively but aggressively. You know as well as I do that Putvedev basically feeds on nationalistic fervour.

Putin as maybe, but Medvedev hasn't really demonstrated his position yet. I don't wonder if this is a war coming straight out of the Prime Minster's office rather than that of the President? It certainly feeds into the rhetoric of the United Russia movement and as is clear: that's a Putin-esque movement rather than one in which Medvedev has any real say.

But it makes no sense for Georgia to join NATO - it's not anywhere near the North Atlantic!

Less pedantically, the continued expansion of NATO up to Russian borders demonstrates the desire of the West to continue fighting a proxy Cold War on the ideological front. If we didn't piss Russia off all the time, perhaps something more constructive might occur? Just a thought?

The regional conflict that I think you speak of has also American interventionist roots, etc. Russia cannot be blamed for this conflict, nor can they be blamed for supporting a close ally. Furthermore, this ally is an autonomous region aiming to earn freedom: shouldn't Westerners be for this freedom-driven idea?

 

Like Chechnya, yes.

Since about roughly 1990! But even still most of the member countries are either in North America or in Europe, which have obvious ties to the North Atlantic. The very fact that NATO troops are stationed in Afghanistan is testimony to the fact that the United Nations is increasingly being sidelined by the leading Western Nations.

A name is just a name. As for the UN, it's not meant to have an offensive role.

 

The United Nations, in which case, serves a much better purpose than having yet another organisation demonstrating Western might. If NATO has outgrown its North Atlantic composition then it no longer serves a use and might as well disband. But it will not because, as I said, it is the perfect excuse for a UN-sceptic US government to sideline the UN.

As for the case of expanding the EU to include Turkey - well part of it is in Europe but the case is far more complex than that and well you know it. Turkey's entry into the EU is being blocked because of its human rights record and the fact that it can't accept the Armenian Genocide has been acknowledged by certain EU countries, e.g. France. Those are the bigger stumbling blocks than a geographical boundary of the 'continent' of Europe.
 
 
I knew Russia would go for Georgia. There's been so much unrest between those two after the NATO announcement. Russia have been giving Georgia money to keep quiet but they've stepped out of line and have asked to join NATO (Which I think they've been conditionally accepted for?). Russia being the only country which isn't allowed in NATO, is pretty pissed off. Damn I would be, Georgia stabbed them in the back!

It's not about 'ethnic cleansing' at all, it's just putting them in their place. Russia won't cease fire, and they won't listen to reason until the Georgians understand that its Russia which have been protecting and funding their country all this time. I think Georgia are to blame for this, they're taking the lions share and the lion is definetly not happy about it.

I expect WWIII, because America will just not stand and watch!.
 
 
I don't know much about world affairs, so excuse me if this question sounds daft, but am I right in thinking that Russia's using South Osettia simply as an excuse to wipe out Georgia? If so, why isn't anyone doing anything about it ?!

I know Russia didn't need a precedent but it hardly makes any NATO or western calls for peace worth any salt (not that russia would care anyway, but it would make any intervention very unlikely).

And please don't be high and mighty with me (unless of course you aren't and I'm reading it wrong, then just ignore that bit)

Not at all. Russia is using South Ossetia in order to expand its sphere of influence in the region and demonstrate that the Georgian President isn't as strong as he thinks he is. It's a similar sort of situation to the Sudetenland annexation in 1938 when Edvard Beneš made much of standing up to Hitler only to see his bluff called.

As for why no one's doing anything... because we can't! Diplomatic channels are about all there is.

I think he massively underestimated the size of the Russian response. I would have done too, in his position, because the Russians have been supplying weapons to the South Ossetians for fifteen years, and you'd have thought their reasons for doing so would be so that they wouldn't have to get heavily involved directly in the event of conflict. It was an understandable error, but boy is he going to regret it.

But it's one of the few modern day comparisons that would make much sense. I suppose, erm, the Serbian tete-a-tete with Kosovo in 1999 but that's not quite the same kind of situation since Kosovo was part of Serbia at the time.

Given the insistence that the South Ossetian's are Russians and their seeming desire to be Russian then surely it's a fair comparison?

Possibly, although there was no certain course of events surely? Saakashvili could have backed down rather than fighting back or sought a way ought that indeed, called the Russians' bluff. In this situation, he's fighting against a superior military power with few people backing him up.

Unless a US jet happened to get in the way... I don't see what good standing up with nothing behind you has done.

That is a fair point. But looking at recent "retaliations" by Russia such as Litvinenko and the Ukranian Pipeline issue, shows they aren't too worried about getting their hands dirty. Maybe the idea of giving Russian citizenship to South Ossetians was carried out to realize this situation?

Yeah, almost certainly. As Bismarck said, the Russians have probably been planning this for a while, and Saakashvili has taken the bait bigtime - possibly knowingly, but he's taken it all the same.

I just wanted you to be a little bit closer with your language. It does no one any favours to speak of attacking troops as an invasion of territory. The things are distinct phases in military conflicts. Russia, in some ways, has invaded Georigan territory; Georgia, on the other hand, has not invade Russian territory (as far as we know).

More seriously, the issue is that the 5 permanent members don't have a great working relationship together so no matter what happens in the SC, it ends up being:

*That (for once) is not me being anti-American just that we've had Clinton and Obama talking up a potential Iranian conflict; McCain on Iraq and Afghanistan. We simply don't need more needless talking up of war between the West and the Rest.

Well, you exaggerate. But I love this bit: UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the fighting risked incurring "civilian losses on a large scale".

Oh really? Did you work that out all by yourself, Milly? How much does he get paid again?

He's an embarrasment to the British Government and should be sacked for his poor performance as Foreign Secretary let alone for his shocking behaviour in the (Labour) Party.

Why, oh why, did Robin Cook have to die?

Can someone explain it to me, I'm a bit confused.

I read this:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7549736.stm 

So Russia support the sepratists, and Georgia wants to reclaim full control of the breakaway states. So Russia started bombing parts of Georgia, so Georgians stop their war with South Ossetia right?

And has Georgia declared war on Russia?

Thanks
 
 
Declaration of war was signed by the Georgian Parliament at about lunchtime today, ish

This is an interesting development, particularly when, as you indicate, Gori is many miles within Georgian territory. Does this suggest that Russia are likely to not only to ensure Ossetian territorial coherency, but to penetrate Georgian territory as well?

So far, my thoughts have focused on a semantic point, but an important one none-the-less. It concerns how we define a war, where we're so used to one that is asymmetrical (i.e., the "war on terror", or the conflict in Iraq against insurgents). Now that two conventional military forces are facing-off, does this indicate a return to more conventional warfare? I suppose all of the old proxy tactics are being deployed, however.

No, I meant "isolationism coming from a Socialist". Oh, and obviously Socialists the world over are linked in some gigantic hivemind, yeah. But like the Zionist Conspiracy, I'm not supposed to know about that

I'm starting to come round to an extent to what you guys are saying in general, but this is just too hard to believe. I'm not sayng it's directed against Russia specifically, but it's just generally a major military object that gives the US a big strategic advantage in that part of the world. How would the US react if Russia built one of those on Cuba and said it was to protect itself from Mexico? The Iran thing is just as unconvincing for two reasons at least:

1) The complex is supposed to be against ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead. Iran is nowhere near acquiring these. Even if it was, it would immediately become apparent - you know better than me that you can't hide one under a bush. And if concrete proof was given that Iran was on its way to getting one and had the facilities for it (which is easy with satellites and constant UN inspections), the whole international community would instantly jump on it. After all, it happily jumped on Iraq even without any proof (or indeed any weapons of MD either).
2) If the US is thinking only of containing Iran, why did it reject Russia's offer to co-operate using Russia's existing anti-missile radar station in Kazakhstan, which is far closer to Iran?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for the thread in general, I agree with oriel historian and Agent Smith pretty much entirely, but with you less so. I appreciate that our position wasn't helped by the other Russian mentalist on this thread, but I think you're too one-sided and don't have any empathy for the position of Russia and its people, when in fact a lot of its actions are perfectly understandable. With the typical American 'we're flawless and Russia is 100% evil', some of the stuff you say is just going too far, and you don't notice that you yourself are biased. E.g.:

- You constantly criticise Russia for lack of democracy, yet conveniently ignore the even greater human rights infringements of Saakashvili's regime, which were reported even in the Georgian media - such as the arrest and beating up of opposition activists. This sort of thing has never happened in Russia, whichever media you trust.

- You triumphantly pasted in an article about how a Russian bombing raid killed Georgian civilians. Firstly, the inaccuracy of any air raid means this is virtually inevitable in a city. The Americans did it in Iraq. Secondly, the Georgians have been killing Ossetian civilians for days now, with many more dead than as a result of Russian actions. (No, I don't need a source to back that up. Just from looking at TV pictures, with Tskhinvali lying in ruins, it's obvious they killed more than just a couple of dozens....)

I think your points are valid and informed, but too one-sided and you stereotype too much.

Well, it makes it even more impossible to deny that it's a "proper" war, if that's what you mean.
 
 
Watching BBC News, the Georgian leader is getting all the air-time giving his side of things. I don't see any spokesman for Russia being given a voice.

Ah..a Russian analyst is now speaking. She says that the Georgian speaks with forked tongue [my paraphrasing!]

Here's the report on the situation from another country's point of view.

 

 
Russian and Georgian troops move into South Ossetia
08/08/2008 - 14   04

  Russian and Georgian troops were heading towards a clash in the breakaway province of South Ossetia today.

Russian columns moved into the area hours after Prime Minister Vladimir Putin warned Georgia it faced retaliation for its attacks there.

Meanwhile Georgian troops launched a major military offensive to regain control of the region.

Russian television showed a convoy of Russian tanks which it said was expected to reach the provincial capital Tskhinvali in a few hours.

The move followed a series of statements by Russian leaders pledging to protect Russian citizens in the region in the face of a massive Georgian military attack on South Ossetia where most of the population have Russian citizenship.
 

Seems Russia is protecting the interests of it's own citizens...just like we or the USA would actually.

Um, yes it has. I assume your "never" means "post-1991", but even then Kasparov would beg to differ.

Difference is, they only became Russian citizens because Russia gave them all passports as part of its bid to undermine Georgia's sovereignty.

Oooh...you're very defensive, my little yankee friend! I'll have you know that I love the USA and it's people...apart from Georgie porgie of course...but then, most Americans I've spoken to in the last few weeks whilst staying there don't care too much for him either.

How do you know why these citizens were granted Russian citizenship? Do you have access to the mind of their leader? No, I thought not.

Your analogy is too daft to even give a thought to, much less serious consideration.

I represent the voice of reason...a voice that is not bound up by partisan politics, unlike you.

And it seems that your thoughts are in the minority - at least as far as the rest of the outside world is concerned...and certainly as far as the newspaper I quoted from.

Please try to view the situation objectively and without a measure of war mongering.

Fair enough, but I meant at the level of political parties. And anyway I'm not sure Kasparov got beaten up.

And yes, of course I meant post-1991. Using post-1936 would be a bit silly.

That's a flawed analogy, for the sheer reason that many South Ossetians wanted to be allied with Russia, as it appeared sympathetic of their cause. The inferrence of your argument is that SO was forced into the position of forcibly wanting their independance by big, bad Russia. However, from what I can tell, the majority of South Ossetia has wanted independance all along.

Russia sure hasn't helped anything, but it's surely not to be blamed for everything either.

Since it's 'breaking news' maybe you ought to at least listen to Putin's words in their entirety before you give a biased knee-jerk response.

After all, we have all had to listen to Georgia's leader holding court thus far.

I think without NATO air backing Georgia is a bit F-ed in the A. It's almost certain that South Ossetia will fall into Russian hands now, as the US and Europe cannot afford a confrontation with Russia. Russia controls Europe's gas supplies, whilst the US is bogged down in Iraq and Afganistan.

Then of course I can't oblige. You think this was done through open, public sources? That's not how Russian diplomacy works.

But as Bis said: If you can provide an alternative explanation for why a load of Georgian citizens of Turkic, not Russian, ethnic descent suddenly have Russian passports, I'd be delighted to hear it.

OK, if the election had been completely fair, Putin (and his party 'United Russia') would have gained, say, 55%, not 65%. Does that change anything? In the last general election the 3 top candidates - Putin, Zyuganov (communist) and Zhirinovski were all sharply anti-western. I can assure you that is a true reflection of the mood of the masses, not rigged.

I mean, what are you trying to tell me? That if the election had been fair, the person who would now be Russian president is the Democratic Party guy who was the only pro-European, and in the end gained barely 1% of the vote? Lol, I can assure you that is not true. I have walked the streets of Moscow countless times, and I can tell you that the overwhelming majority of common people genuinely support Putin and Medvedev - there is absolutely no question about that. And that's Moscow - the second most liberal place in all of Russia after St Petersburg.
 
 
I fully support georgia in this matter. Just imagine if a large chunk of your country suddenly decided they wanted to be independent - thus weakening your country.

The real reason why Russia intervened are the pipelines going through Georgia - this makes the west partially independent from Russia supplying their energy - and this just makes the Russian government really angry.

This whole "Russia is there to help" sounds very similiar to the 2nd World War, when the Soviet Union invaded, pillaged and occupied Poland, all while saying to the west that they are just defending it from the invading Germans. This "liberation" meant that Poland was later occupied by USSR for nearly 50 years.

You are inclined to be extremely offensive and you give a very poor example of the standards one should expect of a mod.

So you admit that neither holds the high moral ground...both are as bad as the other? Well at least that's a start...So get off your high horse and debate properly and with a degree of measured consideration rather than wading in to attack a former enemy of your country, simply because they are an old adversary.

Do you always act in such a blinkered and apparently brain washed manner? Now, how does it feel to have accusations that are suggestive of stupidity thrown back at you?

Just stand back...take stock...stop agitating and watch events unfold, without assuming that WWIII is about to start.

Everything you've described is the country's internal problems. The people basically have said that that is how they want it, and if this isn't democracy, they don't care - they would rather have this than a rating of 1 and people getting shot in the streets by the mafia, as they did in the 90s. I totally understand them. And the people have got what they wanted. What's the problem?

What I agree is unacceptable is if this type of government is then transferred outside of Russia onto other countries Russia tries to gain influence over, as in the case with Georgia here. Which is why I said in my earlier post to you that to a considerable degree, I agree with your points and have changed my opinion with regards to the topic on which this thread was originally started.

A poster referred to Russia wanting to take over the pipelines in Georgia (those pipelines that supply oil to parts of Eurpope - right?)

The comparison with that accusation is the same accusation levelled at the US when they invaded Iraq...that they wanted to have control of the oil resources and use it to supplement their own dwindling reserves.

OK?

Oh, of course. Brain a bit slow there!

But yeah, I don't think the parallel works. Were the Iraqi pipelines feeding the West, the way the Georgian one was?
 
 
The Georgian president was on channel4 news accusing Russia of solving all of its geopolitical problems in on fell swoop. Including the problem of the pipeline and Russia's desire to dominate flow of oil and gas in that region.

But controlling the pipeline is only part of the problem. Internally the oligarchs whom Yeltsin sold the franchises too in the 1990s are still present - albeit less of a problem than before Putin's cull - so there's most definitely internal politicing in Russia as well.
 
 
erm, first, youtube does not serve as proof on this forum.........

secoundly, a "state of war" is different from "declaring war", in fact the Geogrians are trying to get a ceasefire.

What? Of course it doesn't. What it needs is cold, hard cash, and the way to get that is to buy up/poison/bomb all the rival suppliers to the West so it can have us literally over a barrel, like the OPEC cartel did during the Oil Crisis.
 
 
 
The conflict erupting in the Caucasus has set alarm bells ringing for many reasons, not least Georgia’s pivotal role in the supply of Central Asian oil to the West.

While it has no significant oil or gas reserves of its own, Georgia is a key transit point for oil from the Caspian region destined for Europe and the United States. Crucially, it is the only practical route from this increasingly important producer region that avoids both Russia and Iran.

The 1,770-kilometre (1,100mile) Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which cost $3 billion (£1.55 billion) to build and was partly underwritten by British taxpayers, entered full service last year. It is the world’s second-longest oil pipeline and pumps about a million barrels a day from Baku, on the coast of the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan, to Yumurtalik, on Turkey’s Mediterranean coast, where it is loaded on to supertankers. The route also avoids the congested Bosphorus shipping lane.

About 250 kilometres of the route passes through Georgia, with parts of it running only 55 kilometres from South Ossetia. It also runs close to another secessionist Georgian region, Abkhazia.

The security of the BTC pipeline has been a concern since well before it was built. The first big attack on the pipeline took place last week in Turkey, where part of it was destroyed by Kurdish separatists.

Output from the pipeline, which carries more than 1 per cent of the global supply, has been cut and is likely to be on hold for several weeks while a fire is extinguished and the damage repaired.

The threat of another attack by separatists in Georgia is very real. Georgian rebels in the breakaway regions have threatened to sabotage the pipeline in the past. The BTC pipeline, which is 30 per cent owned by BP, is buried throughout its length to make attacks more difficult.

It was first conceived in the 1990s as a way of cutting the West’s dependence on energy supplies from the Middle East and Russia, and was always a politically charged project. Russia, which views the Caucasus as its own sphere of influence, wants Central Asian oil to be exported through its own territory and always opposed the pipeline’s construction.

The BTC pipeline was one of the largest private construction projects in the world and is controlled by a consortium that includes BP and the American groups Chevron and ConocoPhilips, Total of France and the state oil company of Azerbaijan.

BP said it was confident that the BTC pipeline was secure and was not under threat from the current fighting in South Ossetia. It said that the fire in Turkey meant that current supplies of oil were being diverted through other pipelines and by rail to ports on Georgia’s Black Sea coast.

I think Belarus probably would if it thought anyone cared. Don't know about Armenia. I didn't think it was that pro-Russian, except in the same sense the Ossetians are of having a shared enemy.
 
It's just overly simplistic, and clearly written by someone who doesn't know what they're writing about (i.e. just citing experts and putting in some filler in between).
 

It's a national newspaper, not a PhD thesis. The more people read even such simplistic analyses of things, the better informed Joe Public will be.

Russia has the 8th largest oil reserves in the world!

Now that also states that the Russian economy is dependent on oil and gas exports. How does pissing off the West serve its interests? I can't see that it does.

They are not Russians, nor do they claim to be Russians. Their main preference is also independence, but they'll accept being part of Russia simply because a distant devil is preferable to a nearby one.

 

They (most) have Russian passports and speak Russian (with a distinct accent) if that doesn't make them Russian I don't know what can.

But then again I don't really know much about either situation.

I guess it depends on one's view of what citizenship is. In France's case that is most true - the language and the possession of the passport are key aspects of Frenchness.

Others see it through ethnic lenses which is more problematic.

That dichtomoy is not easily breeched.

No matter how much it pisses us off, we will still need oil. If it can cut down the amount we get from sources other than itself, Russia will be in an incredibly strong position economically. The West (by which I mean principally Europe here) might grumble, but there is almost no price that we wouldn't pay. We'd have to. And some of the newer EU countries might start having second thoughts about the long-term wisdom of having hitched their wagon to the Western horse.

Haha, so possession of a passport plus speaking the language equals proof of nationality now? My passport says "European Union" on it, and I speak four European languages. Do I have quadruple nationality? If I were to give my passport to a Canadian, would that make him British (and French, if he was a Québecois)?

Your passport isn't issued by the European Union, however, it's a British Passport that has the rights and privileges of a European Citizen attached to it. Hence the colour. The definition of citizenship is so complex to tie down.

As silver linings go...

Anyway, arguably it's a proxy clash between the Eastern Orthodox model and the Western quasi-secular one, even though Georgia is superficially Orthodox. I bet at some psychological level the Russians would love to Russify Georgia as far as they could just to make sure it didn't turn Westwards.

Hmm, true. However, I don't think the South Ossetians are Russian in any meaningful sense, except as far as the Kremlin is concerned.

Well, to reinforce it then. Anyway, you know what I mean - the fear is that Georgia has started down the road away from the Russian cultural model, and clearly the logical way to turn it round is to bomb the crap out of it.

I don't doubt that Clash of Civilisations is a load of useless rubbish in general, but I think that as long as one one keeps that in mind it applies more than you'd think to this situation.

Russia doesnt want the Georgian pipelines to fill their own oil needs. The pipelines just have cut out Russia roles as the middle-man. Not only does this impact their income, but makes the west somewhat independent from Russia. Without these pipelines, if Russia would want to start a WW3 and invade the west, they wouldnt really need a big army - just turn off the oil/gas and wait a few months (most preferably in winter).

Also, when you've got the time and space to absolutely destroy someone's argument, doing so at length and in depth is much more fun than just saying "yeah, it's a pile of crap because x y z, next point". I found this with my own essays and such.

Hypothetically, yes, but in practice I think big wars went out of fashion for the foreseeable future as soon as the Arms Race got going. Russia wouldn't want to conquer us - after all, what would be the point? - it would just want to gouge us for as much money as it could. And it could name its price.

Clue's in the name. Also, we'd all better watch our mouths otherwise zealous Russian nationalist script kiddies will DDoS TSR into the ground like they did with all those Georgian Government sites.

I'd be interested to see what LiveJournal's moderation has been like on this issue. They were bought up by some Russian company that was definitely not affiliated with the Government at all last year, and everyone got terribly dramatic about it.
