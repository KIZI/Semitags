China's defense ministry said recently that the removal of missiles and miliary
deployments  targeting  Taiwan will be a negotiable issue under the "One China"
principle. Taiwan later responded by urging Beijing to remove the missiles,
based on the "1992 consensus" -- which means agreeing to disagree on what "one
China" means.

The differences between the sides lie in the content of "one China." Therefore,
redefining "one China" is an issue that Beijing needs to deal with seriously.

Beijing must realize that the so-called "Taiwan issue" is one concerning the
status of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The main problem here is that Beijing
has been denying the ROC and trying to eradicate the ROC.

In this case, applying a "rooftop theory" that defines "one China" as a "third
concept" can provide a resolution. This is our suggestion: "There is only one
China in the world. Both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of
China are parts of China. China's sovereignty and territory must not be
separated." (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 7, 2010)
