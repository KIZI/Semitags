Tonight is the first game of the Bruins journey to the Cup. Depending on what is going on in the game there may be many profanities in my statuses. You have been forewarned. I usually try my best to be on my best behavior on FB, but playoffs are a completely different story.
 
 
GOOD LUCK BRUINS! AND THE BOSTON BRUINS! ;)

Oops, Canucks!

My cousin does this and it makes me want to hide her.

YAAAAAAAAAAY! Go B's!!!
 
 
 
 

I am usually really good about it, but sometimes in the heat of the moment I get a little out of control. I usually delete the posts shortly after I write them because I feel foolish, but my passion runs pretty deep for the Bruins. That is why I am issuing a warning. I realize it is obnoxious!

haha I feel bad about it, but she posts about every.single.play. It's like I'm at the game with her (which is bad for me, since I don't like hockey).
However, being from MA originally, go Bruins!
 
 
Wouldn't expect any thing less

Yes! I love the support! I don't post about every single play! I usually write a status if Chara scores, or if there is something crazy happening. I am not one of those, "Oh, I must prove my love by writing everything that happens!"
 
 
I will take that under advisement.

Does that mean I can send you a FR?

I love that you're warning us about this! I look forward to seeing your status updates!!

Luckily, I have been able to control myself. They get progressively worse depending on what series we are in. Also, I have started to write then quickly deleted about 8 already haha!

We're not FB friends, but I can't imagine you've said anything bad tonight. It's hasn't been a really exciting game.

You'd be surprised at what a game like this will do to me. I have almost been out of line a few times tonight, but I didn't hit enter... yet.

I will admit I did yell at the tv a couple of times. And I always tell Jack to shut up.

  Jack is my most favorite ever! I love Jack! Although, he is cursed. I have been flipping out on my TV. My neighbors must think I am nuts!
 
 
Well, That was a bullsh*t call. I friggen hate losing Chara. He is our best Penalty Killer.
 
 
I have a love/hate relationship with Jack. I love some of the things that just randomly come out of his mouth, with the exception of the dee-to-dee it drives me insane!!
Yeah totally a bad call, and Holtby is standing on his head tonight, they can't seem to get anything past him.
 
 
Corvo should be taken out of the lineup and when his line is on the ice they should just play 5 on 4. It would be better for us.
 
 
Corvo hasn't been one of my favorites.
 
 
Eff yes! 15 more baby!

I know to have respect for the playoffs and not text message anyone during a game (unless it is about the said game!)
