In fact, I'm sure the President will apologize for the fact that YOU even said something so inflammatory.

Let's see if we can locate Iraq in relation to Syria.

 

Now, HOW might ol' Saddam have gotten the WMDs that he didn't have out of Iraq?

Hm.

Yep.

It's a puzzlement alright.

What a lying POS you are!   Clinton says nothing about WMDs, and the 2008 report linked to by your source says the mustard gas came from Iran, not Iraq!!!

From your link:

 
In her prepared remarks in Tunis, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she supported more sanctions on the Assad regime but she declined to endorse any direct help to the Syrian opposition without the consent of the Syrian government, saying only, "We all need to look hard at what more we can do."

Yes...as do I. I recall the libs going hysterical and concluding that there could not be any WMD because we couldn't find them. I recall saying that that proves there is no such thing as a black swan because nobody has ever seen one.

What was the name of that valley in Syria where many suspected the WMD were moved?

I bet we already have some people in the country. Obama is being urged to give aid and technical assistance to the rebels. It won't be long 'til we have troops on the ground.

The Clinton quote came from your foreignpolicy.com link and the below quote comes from the report linked to from your same foreignpolicy.com.

 http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pub..._syrianwmd.pdf 

 
Syrian Chemical Weapons
Syria has chemical weapons, and most experts believe it has mustard agents and at least
ordinary nerve gas. It may have persistent nerve gas as well. It is believed to have cluster
warheads for delivering chemical weapons, and it probably has chemical bombs and
rocket warheads as well. It may have chemical artillery shells.
There are other reports that Syria has benefited from sales and technology transfers from
Iran. Some reports indicate that Syria is undertaking ―an innovative chemical warfare
(CW) program in cooperation with Iran.‖ i Syria‘s CW program began in the mid-1970s,
and its facilities are known to have successfully produced VX and sarin nerve agents as
well as mustard blister agents, but not independently. The Scientific Studies and Research
Center (CERS) runs the facilities in Dumayr, Khan Abou, Shamat, and Furklus.ii There
are reports that Syria imported hundreds of tons of hydrochloric acid and ethylene glycol
(MEG) from Iran. These chemical agents are precursors for the production of mustard
blister agents and sarin nerve gas. The precursors would be used and mounted on Scud-
B/C warheads and/or on aerial bombs. Construction of the chemical facilities was said to
be due to start in late 2005, with what was then estimated an estimated one-year to
complete construction. These reports have not been confirmed, but Syria has long sought
to end its dependence on other countries for the precursors and other components of
chemical agents.iii
The same reports did not indicate that a contract had been signed, but that the draft
agreements would lead Iranian scientists from the Iranian Defense Industries
Organization to assist Syria in establishing the infrastructure and location of the new
chemical facilities. It will also supply Syria with reactors, pipes, condensers, heat
exchangers, and storage and feed tanks as well as chemical detection equipment for
airborne agents. Then Iran will assist in producing and piloting the first four or five CW
facilities throughout Syria, producing precursors for VX and sarin nerve agents and
mustard blister agents.

 
 
 
Bingo.
let me tell you one thing.
I was on gulf war one.
my army group stumbled on sooo much.unknown chemical shit it wasnt funny.
this was in 1991.
some guys and gals came back with skins eating away and blisters.
Commanders told us to shut up,and get treated.
 
 
Was in kuwait and iraq,southern.
 
 
I think that at this point we should all just give up, convert to Islam and beg for mercy.

Because the only way that WMD could have been moved from Iraq to Syria while Iraq was saturated with U.N and American weapons inspectors AND while we had constant satellite and air survallence over Iraq is if God were truly on Saddam's side.

In which case the situation is hopeless.

Try again fool!
 
 
Bottom line,they came from iraq. That nutcase was manufacturing everything under the sun there.we saw it firsthand,and even surveillance showed trucks of chemicals and weapons being shipped over the border.

So Bush knew that there were no WMDs in Iraq BEFORE the invasion of Iraq because they were moved to Syria and he chose to waste American lives looking for WMDs in Iraq anyway.

Hey, who cares. All we're after here is an excuse to exercise our American Exceptionalism and bomb the living snot out of another sovereign country in the Middle East. Maybe we can move a few hundred thousand troops in there, too. We need to shown them who owns this planet. After all, we're Ammmuuuurrrica!

I am tempted to be overtly sarcastic.

But I kinda like Kiki. So, I'll behave myself. <<grumble grumble>>

First off, there is information (which I already posted a little portion of) suggesting that our eyes in the sky DID see some of what was happenin'. But at the time, you see, Syria being a separate sovereign nation probably would have said "no" if we had asked to inspect the stuff that was getting shipped over from Iraq.

Secondly, our reticence to act on what we were observing (if our spies in the sky were properly directed at the relevant times) MIGHT have had something to do with a notion of restraint. Preparing to go in and kick Saddam's ass was one thing. But opening up the entire middle east might have seemed -- imprudent.
 
 
 
Funnier than that,i watched that map real time last night,and there were 3 iranian bomb blasts...

 

Apparently? The iraqui's were equipped to deal with it as we were told by Obama as he took credit for something Bush had scheduled before he left office.

Because the only way that WMD could have been moved from Iraq to Syria while Iraq was saturated with U.N and American weapons inspectors AND while we had constant satellite and air survallence over Iraq is if God were truly on Saddam's side.

In which case the situation is hopeless.

Try again fool!

 World Threats » Did Iraqi WMD Go to Syria and Other Countries? 

IT was said way back in 2002 and 2003 that our satellites did observe the movement of suspected WMD from Iraq to Syria. Various intelligence analysts reached the same conclusion.

But Richard-Aytch finds that improbable, so they must all be wrong.

 

 

So Bush knew that there were no WMDs in Iraq BEFORE the invasion of Iraq because they were moved to Syria and he chose to waste American lives looking for WMDs in Iraq anyway.
Thank you for that revelation.

 

Knowing that SOME "things" were possibly being shipped from Saddam's regime to Syria does NOT constitute knowledge of how much of it was WMD.

So, no.

As always, you can't think straight due to the effect of having your head squarely up your own ass.

The key word is 'suspected'. Official U.S. intelligence 'suspected' WMDs all over Iraq. They were wrong.

Holy shit!

When John Kennedy suspected that nuclear missiles were in Cuba, he ordered low level reconaisnace flights in order to obtain absolute proof, nothing less could justify military actions.

The Bush adminitration suspected every factory in Iraq - and probably every truck and half the private homes of having WMDs. Even though years of inspections had never turned up anything. There was no feasible proof

Sure, they 'suspected' that Iraqi's were stuffing WMDs in their back pockets and carrying them to Syria...sure it was happening all the time.
 
 
 
 
 
Agreed.

VERY perplexing.

This might call for some visual aids.

Let's go old school. Let us start with a "map."

Let's see if we can locate Iraq in relation to Syria.

 

Now, HOW might ol' Saddam have gotten the WMDs that he didn't have out of Iraq?

Hm.

Yep.

It's a puzzlement alright.

 

Actually, I'd like to know Liability. How did the mightiest strongest most powerful military and intelligence agencies NOT see this transport as it [prepared] to invade the country?

 

I am tempted to be overtly sarcastic.

But I kinda like Kiki. So, I'll behave myself. <<grumble grumble>>

First off, there is information (which I already posted a little portion of) suggesting that our eyes in the sky DID see some of what was happenin'. But at the time, you see, Syria being a separate sovereign nation probably would have said "no" if we had asked to inspect the stuff that was getting shipped over from Iraq.

Secondly, our reticence to act on what we were observing (if our spies in the sky were properly directed at the relevant times) MIGHT have had something to do with a notion of restraint. Preparing to go in and kick Saddam's ass was one thing. But opening up the entire middle east might have seemed -- imprudent.

 

Imprudent certainly. Residual for another day? Same. How will Obama respond is the question...a REAL World international question looms for Obama and the Hildebeast to handle...

Caution or Iron fist? We see how Libya turned out...same with Egypt...third time a charm for the O ?
 
 
The dumbass libs here trying to claim they know there are no WMDs in Syria are going to look dumber than usual......  
 
 
 
Damn! Now we have to spend another trillion and thousands of lives to invade them too?

 

We can't afford another screwball R in the White House.

Instead of getting into another dumb R war, killing thousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands of civilians and then having to clean it up...

Why don't we spend that same money the way President Obama wants ?

Rebuilding America.

so,now libs,are you going to say yiur old XXXXX hero is a liar?
bush did fuck up. Announcing his intentions so this lot was moved from iraq to syria.

 

What a lying POS you are!   Clinton says nothing about WMDs, and the 2008 report linked to by your source says the mustard gas came from Iran, not Iraq!!!

From your link:

 
In her prepared remarks in Tunis, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she supported more sanctions on the Assad regime but she declined to endorse any direct help to the Syrian opposition without the consent of the Syrian government, saying only, "We all need to look hard at what more we can do."

 

 

Guess AGAIN. Syria aided the US in the Gulf War. No love lost until Saddam WAS O-U-T.

Hostility between Syria and Iraq started in the 1960s when both were ruled by the Baath Party. Syria closed its embassy in Baghdad after Saddam Hussein took power in 1979.[3] Later, Syria joined the anti-Saddam coalition that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation in the 1991 Gulf War. Up until the renewal of diplomatic ties in 2006, Iraqi leaders often accused Syria of trying to destabilize their country by allowing Sunni Arab foreign fighters to cross the border Iraq shares with Syria.
Relations with Syria have been marred by traditional rivalry for pre-eminence in Arab affairs, allegations of involvement in each others internal politics, and disputes over the waters of Euphrates River, oil transit fees, and stances toward Israel. Syria broke relations after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and joined other Arab countries in sending military forces to the coalition that forced Iraq out of Kuwait. Relations remained cool until Bashar al-Asad became President of Syria in 2000.

Syria assisted the US in Bush's War, capturing one of Saddam's sons. But Bush was later angry Syria did not do more. The problem NOW is Syria slaughtering its own people:
************************************************** *
Syrian officials are hoping that the aid they gave in the arrest will help restore them to the good graces of the Bush administration, which has been divided on what to do about Damascus. In recent years, U.S. intelligence officials have praised the assistance they have received from Syria in tracking and nabbing Al Qaeda terrorists.

No, those did not exist, Syria has its own, and has had for YEARS. They sucked up to Bush to gain US support, we let them get more than Saddam had. Saddam could not keep electricity on in Baghdad by the time we invaded.

So, support the opposition, now with HAMAS by our side, or Assad, the mass killer of his own people? A LOSE/LOSE situation for Obama.

Liability, Saddam was on his way DOWN when we invaded. He had NOTHING. But Syria HAS, and is using it to kill the Syrian opposition which HAMAS now supports. So does Obama side with the Hamas backed opposition or a mass murderer? Syria lifted not one finger for Saddam, except the al Qaeda sympathizers Assad was HAPPY to kill. Syria caught Hassan. But now is a really tough choice, Obama cannot please many in the US, whatever he does.

With saddams weapons....

 

No, those did not exist, Syria has its own, and has had for YEARS. They sucked up to Bush to gain US support, we let them get more than Saddam had. Saddam could not keep electricity on in Baghdad by the time we invaded.

So, support the opposition, now with HAMAS by our side, or Assad, the mass killer of his own people? A LOSE/LOSE situation for Obama.

 

See the libtard round about. This post just proved the libtard stupidity.

Syria never signed the Chemical Weapons Treaty, and hot all they needed from INDIA:
************************************************** *
American diplomatic cables revealed that Indian firms had aided Syrian chemical and biological weapons makers with obtaining equipment. The cable reminded India that it "has a general obligation as a Chemical Weapons Convention State Party to never, under any circumstances, assist anyone in the development of chemical weapons".[38]

Vampiric, I posted the FACTS: SYRIA GOT WMDs from India, Turkey AND Russia. Israel bombed their nuke plant but there is plenty of WMDs to go around. As HAMAS is supporting the opposition, the US may have a REAL WMD problem, not fantasies. The idea that Saddam shipped his weapons to Syria rather than USE them when invaded is BIZARRE.

That others may have sent shit to Syria hardly constitutes evidence that Iraq (under Saddam) did not do so, too.

And I deny that the US is trapped. I do concede that the nature of the problems in that region are as thorny as hell. So, what else is new?

Wrong.

Assuming our eyes in the sky were trained on the right locations at the right times, we might have had some reason to believe that some of Saddam's WMD was being sent to Syria.

That would not constitute sufficient basis to believe that he had entirely divested himself of all such WMD.

And there never was any reason to deem Saddam's regime to be pacifistic. Just ask all the dead Kurds.

From Syria TODAY:

Syrians demonstrating Friday condemned the positions of Russia, China and Iran — countries whose governments have stood by the Assad regime.

"Iranian and Russian bullets are tearing apart our bodies," read a large banner unfurled in the town of Tibet el-Imam just north of the central city of Hama.

 Page 2: At Least 50 Killed in Syria as Regime Pounds Homs - ABC News 

Again, the fantasy that Saddam had anything to give & sacrificed his rule by shipping weapons OUTSIDE Iraq is alarming. It has been in the news since Bush was in office Syria was being armed by Turkey, India & Russia. Iran also contributed. This words are from a Syrian fighting Assad, no mention of Saddam of course.
 
 
 
 
No,they did not.

And the link from the source in the OP says the nuke technology came from North Korea, pakistan and Iran, so it seems like Syria got their WMD from just about everyone EXCEPT Iraq!!!

 http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pub..._syrianwmd.pdf 

Syrian Nuclear Weapons
Syria has long had an interest in acquiring nuclear weapons.iv Its primary partner seems
to have been North Korea, although it may have acquired some of the technology and
weapons designs sold by the A.Q. Khan network, possibly though Iran, and may have
acquired technology and design data from other sources.
However, new evidence surfaced in 2007 that Syria had a far more active nuclear
weapons effort than had previously been reported. On September 8, 2007, the Syrian
Arab News Agency reported Israeli air strikes and dropped ―munitions‖ in Syria without
any reports of damage or casualties.v Unclassified satellite photographs later made it clear
that an Israeli air raid had struck deep into northeast Syria on September 6, 2007, at a
target that the imagery strongly indicated might have been a covert Syrian effort to build
a nuclear reactor. The images were similar to those of facilities that could contain North
Korean designs and that could be used to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.vi
 
 
 
 
 
That others may have sent shit to Syria hardly constitutes evidence that Iraq (under Saddam) did not do so, too.

And I deny that the US is trapped. I do concede that the nature of the problems in that region are as thorny as hell. So, what else is new?

And there never was any reason to deem Saddam's regime to be pacifistic. Just ask all the dead Kurds.

 

Sarcasm. And all sources are reporting the weapons were supplied by Turkey, India, and Russia, now Iran also.This from those fighting. Saddam hadn't enough electrical or other power sources to produce much in the way of weapons; we learned that shortly after the invasion. Nothing would explain his giving weapons away rather than USE them. He knew we would invade, Bush let the world know; he could never control his ego. Saddam's few troops fighting with 20 year old guns, homemade bombs, and knives. That is why Baghdad fell so fast; the JCS termed Bush's war plan faulty as NOTHING was planned for after the invasion. Obama shares the blame with Bush for allowing Syria to become such a threat; most of the WMDs came in while Bush was President, but Obama has not done enough to reverse the power obtained.

By the way, I do not blame Bush I as much as many do for not going into Baghdad in the Gulf War; American opinion was against further action.

*I* am one of the best in my field...Government contracts MY services becuase they have no other choice.

That must bother the HELL out of YOU.

Good.

 

Not really. Frankly, I don't care. You must have served when you could still get away with being illiterate.

Thank God your stupid ass wasn't in my platoon.

And, God bless Government spending, huh?

As a taxpayer, you're welcome

 

Nothing Illiterate here baby...especially when it comes to High Technology Communications.

*TRY AGAIN*

Asswipe.

 

Rock on,brother.

You are the biggest statest on the board!

So be honest, you don't really want to lower government spending do you? That's your paycheck!

Your use of the word against me shows that YOU have no earthly idea what it means...

Long of the short of it?

*You Lose* In the venacular,

I used to have some respect for you...you torpedoded it.

Awesome job dimwit.  

You have relegated yourself to the stack of forgotten or soon to be idiots...Gee? that's TWO high honors from me that YOU have garnered.

Cool accomplishment.

Your mommy must be so proud. Almost like a gold star to be hung on your icebox...TWIT.  
 
 
 
 
 
Nope. Not going to wade through shit to find your corrobative evidence. It's your thread and the edit function exists for a reason.

If you can't support your own bullshit, you are more worthless then I thought.

 

Translation:" I am not going to find fact...I am more interested in looking as stupid as I am portrayed...and I won't lift a finger to defend it..."

YES you are a fucking idiot. I did correct his link. YOU are too fucking lazy to find it.

The EXIT out of this thread is that way===>

Use it before you hurt yourself.

 

Look, dipshit:

I don't have the patience to do Eddie Boy's scut work. His sorry ass made the claim, now it's his job to support it.

I can only guess that, since you have been blasted for 10 pages, it didn't say what his dumbass thought it did.

How in the can are you? Because if you are sauced enough to start tossing threats around, I might find this banality entertaining enough to stick around and watch.

 

You got that exactly right, but I would go farther and say that he deliberately put a bad link up precisely because he KNEW Hillary never verified WMDs in Syria as his lying title says. I actually took the time to find his story and posted what Clinton actually said earlier in this thread. Here it is again from the working link to his source in the OP.

 Exclusive: State Department quietly warning region on Syrian WMDs | The Cable 

In her prepared remarks in Tunis, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she supported more sanctions on the Assad regime but she declined to endorse any direct help to the Syrian opposition without the consent of the Syrian government, saying only, "We all need to look hard at what more we can do."

I had addressed that also earlier in this thread and included the link his source used that provided the countries Syria got its WMDs from. Actually I posted it more than once.

But again, nowhere does the story linked in the OP say that Syria's WMDs came from Iraq!!!!! The lying   made that up just like the phony claim that Clinton verified WMDs.

Here is yet again the report the Link in the OP cited as the countries that provided Syria with their WMDs. Show me where IRAQ is mentioned. As I pointed out earlier when I posted the link, Syria got their WMD capibility from just about everyone EXCEPT Iraq!!!!!!

I'm sorry.... Just the thought of them playing in the "Special Olympics" under Their Own Flag, separate from Us, and I lose control. How effective were they again in Iraq, after the Initial Invasion??? You know, when all civil authority vanished??? Yeah, really credible source.   Let me know when you figure out who's interests they serve. I mean, I know we pay them, but who do they really work for???

             
 
 
Oh well, we better rush off to War i guess. Boy, the Globalist Elite & Military Industrial Complex really want that War with Syria huh? Looks like they're willing to do or say anything to get it. How long before they label Assad 'Hitler?' 'Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace.' Isn't it great?

Damn! Now we have to spend another trillion and thousands of lives to invade them too?

 

An Invasion is unlikely. But we will fund and help with the bombing & killing. They should be labelling Assad 'Worse than Hitler' any day now. So stay tuned.

Click the middle east/Iraq tab and then go to the older documentation. It reveals a lot of reality in script before it ever happened.

Then one has to consider who put Saddam in power, who sold him bio weapons and advocated his nuclear programs...that is, until he invaded Kuwait without the green light from his handlers (or did he??)

Then, there is this guy here, written by a Brookings Int. thinktank.

Rumsfeld and Reagan bolstered for Saddam's attack on Iran. They gave him weapons and support for that endeavor.Before that time, the CIA was involved in the coup (1969) that brought the baath party into power and in subsequent years, Saddam in power.

 Iraq 

U.S. government authorized the sale of dual use chemicals and biological material to Iraq
A review of thousands of declassified government documents and interviews with former U.S. policymakers shows that U.S. provided intelligence and logistical support, which played a crucial role in arming Iraq. Under the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, the U.S. authorized the sale to Iraq of numerous dual use items that had both military and civilian applications, including chemicals which can be used in manufacturing of pesticides or chemical weapons and live viruses and bacteria, such as anthrax and bubonic plague used in medicine and the manufacture of vaccines or weaponized for use in biological weapons.
A report of the U.S. Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs concluded that the U.S. under the successive presidential administrations sold materials including anthrax, VX nerve gas, West Nile fever and botulism to Iraq right up until March 1992. The chairman of the Senate committee, Don Riegle, said: "The executive branch of our government approved 771 different export licenses for sale of dual-use technology to Iraq. I think its a devastating record."[13] According to several former officials, the State and Commerce departments promoted trade in such items as a way to boost U.S. exports and acquire political leverage over Hussein.[14]

Lastly, disrespecting a 4 star general on unfounded and complete bullshit charges only solidifies that you're a nut. But, if it works for you, go for it.
 
 
Oh, well then lets go right to War. I mean if Hillary Clinton said it, than it must be true. It's not like the Clintons ever lie or are corrupt in any way. Seriously people, to Hell with Hillary Clinton. She's full of shite, just like her husband.

bush did fuck up. Announcing his intentions so this lot was moved from iraq to syria.

 

why would anyone trust Hillary anymore than Bush ? they are both corrupt to the core

 

 

Not the bastion of integrity that President Obama represents?

Or is it just that both are human and you are offended by that imperfection?
 
 
Hillary may be able to resolve this crisis by using every diplomatic tool available, continuing to isolate the Syrian government diplomatically and working to tighten international sanctions. The Friends of Syria conference in Tunisia was successful and Saudi Arabia is now backing the idea of arming the rebels.
 
 
 
Oh, well then lets go right to War. I mean if Hillary Clinton said it, than it must be true. It's not like the Clintons ever lie or are corrupt in any way. Seriously people, to Hell with Hillary Clinton. She's full of shite, just like her husband.

 

he fucked an intern with a cigar at the whitehouse and saved it to smoke later..spunked all over her blue dress...lied about it and tried to throw her under the bus..and this crazy bitch is still with him because shes a psychopath too

Bottom line,they came from iraq. That nutcase was manufacturing everything under the sun there.we saw it firsthand,and even surveillance showed trucks of chemicals and weapons being shipped over the border.

 

And in the 2nd excursion over there, they found residual amounts. So the claim that NONE were found is simply wrong...just not in the quantities we knew they had.

 

Bullshit

 

You are full of it. BUSH WAS RIGHT!!! Idiot.
 
 
 
 
 
Oh well, we better rush off to War i guess. Boy, the Globalist Elite & Military Industrial Complex really want that War with Syria huh? Looks like they're willing to do or say anything to get it. How long before they label Assad 'Hitler?' 'Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace.' Isn't it great?

 

These warmongers are the people you stand side by side with politically. You only differ in that one area.

 

Partisan hackery isn't going to do it. The "liberals" have been taken over in policy and practice by communists. This story isn't about that though. We're talking about the other side of the aisles hijacking.

 

Taken over in policy and practice by communists?

Good god... why are you stuck in the cold war still? News Flash... Communists are not very prevalent in the United States, let alone in congress.
 
 
Communists have taken over the lib party. Read  marxist.org: The Leading Marxist Site on the Net . Obamas following everything according to the communist manifesto.

Oh boy; Syria got these weapons from India, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Assad & Saddam BOTH proclaimed themselves the TRUE leader of Ba'ath, relations were a bit better after 1990, but that did not stop Syria from capturing Hassan, and turning over to new Iraqi government for execution.
************************************************** *****

The Syrian government, under intense pressure from the US and others in the international community, made its first significant concession yesterday by handing over to the interim Iraqi government Saddam Hussein's half-brother and former head of the Iraqi secret police, Sabawi Ibrahim al-Hassan al-Tikriti.
Iraqi officials said the move was an apparent gesture of goodwill on the part of the Syrian president, Bashar Assad.

Mr Hassan is the last of Saddam's three half-brothers to be captured and was 36th on the US list of 55 most wanted members of Saddam's regime. All but 11 of the 55 have been found.

The article seems to indicate that this has nothing to do with Iraq at all - that Syria has had their own program for years. It actually seems to indicate that Bush was wrong about Iraq and in contrast, this is to be taken "Syria-lessly" (sorry, couldn't help it!).
From the article you cite: "We are talking about legitimate WMDs here -- this isn't Iraq. The administration is really concerned about loose WMDs."

Thanks for the link though. This just adds to the long list of reasons we should not listen to the Republicans who are importuning for us to get more involved. Instead, we should listen to Obama and Clinton - Stay TF out of it.

Okay maybe so. But I'm sure you're aware that everyone here claims to have graduated from Harvard with a specialty in Constitutional Law, MIT with a PhD in Physics; oh yes and an LLM in Tax from NYU; received six purple hearts during their TOD's in IRaq, Afghanistan and of course the places they can't mention and so on...
So I'm not sure what you saw but I'm very confident there were no WMD's in Iraq. Except the ones we gave them, which went inert long before the first Gulf War.
The evidence is overwhelming to this effect.
I in no way am saying I believe you to be a liar, btw.

I think taht you hit the nail on the head with that one....

It seems that wingnuts are desparately trying to get public sentiment for invading Syria, despite the fact that it's militariliy unfeasible.

They're hoping to get us embroiled in a disasterous military engagement so that Obama loses the election.

All because they're too cheap to pay their fair share of the taxes. Great patriots ain't they!

Sleeze bags!
 
 
WMD's in Syria! lol! Clinton is such a corrupt asshole.
 
 
 
 
Sooooo.........Syria has wmd's but Iraq didn't? I'm deeply flummoxed.

 

Agreed.

VERY perplexing.

This might call for some visual aids.

Let's go old school. Let us start with a "map."

Let's see if we can locate Iraq in relation to Syria.

 

Now, HOW might ol' Saddam have gotten the WMDs that he didn't have out of Iraq?

Hm.

Yep.

It's a puzzlement alright.

 

WOW Color me shocked.

Syria has WMD's??

No. We don't need to invade them.

Hillary Clinton is a corrupt idiot. Keep in mind, she voted in favor of the Iraq War. There are no WMD's in Syria. She's a liar. Period, end of story.

CONZ are so STUPID, even YEARS AFTER it's all too apparent they were lied to and played for CHUMPS by Bushco and the neocons, they STILL cling to the lies the Bush administration told them rather than admit they were wrong. Not to mention their apparently willingness to send our young men and women into battle because of shitty intelligence, poorly interpreted. AGAIN!

Is there any lesson so painful, you CONZ might actually LEARN it? Or does pretending you didn't go to war for nothing and wreck the economy through your agenda of deregulation work to inoculate you from your dismal failures?

This guy said so:

The man who served as the no. 2 official in Saddam Hussein's air force says Iraq moved weapons of mass destruction into Syria before the war by loading the weapons into civilian aircraft in which the passenger seats were removed.

The Iraqi general, Georges Sada, makes the charges in a new book, "Saddam's Secrets," released this week. He detailed the transfers in an interview yesterday with The New York Sun.

"There are weapons of mass destruction gone out from Iraq to Syria, and they must be found and returned to safe hands," Mr. Sada said. "I am confident they were taken over."

Mr. Sada's comments come just more than a month after Israel's top general during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Moshe Yaalon, told the Sun that Saddam "transferred the chemical agents from Iraq to Syria."

Gotta love Liability! Um yeah. They're close to each other. oooh! I guess that means that Iraq is pals with Saudi Arabia? Hey, Israel is pretty close! They must be buddies too! Un f-ing real how stupid people can be when they want to believe something because of political blindness.

The article cited indicate that this has nothing to do with Iraq at all - that Syria has had their own program for years. The article indicates that Bush was wrong about Iraq and in contrast, this is to be taken "Syria-lessly" (sorry, couldn't help it!).
From the article you cite: "We are talking about legitimate WMDs here -- this isn't Iraq. The administration is really concerned about loose WMDs."

And for those completely blinded by party to the obvious, Syria supported the coalition against Iraq in the Gulf War. When Saddam took power, Syria closed their embassy. These weren't "pals" folks.

But even then, as the article claims, the ONLY concern revealed is because we know Syria has had their own program.

This just adds to the long list of reasons we should not listen to the Republicans who are importuning for us to get more involved in Syria. Instead, we should listen to Obama and Clinton - Stay TF out of it.
We don't know who is behind the uprising.
We don't have access to 1000 miles of shoreline as we did in Libya.
We know at least 20 - 30% of the population still support al-Assad and it could be more.
Heavy collateral damage would be impossible to avoid, so we'll end up looking like bad guys.

Having a conversation with you is not unlike having one with a retarded syphilitic chimp who incessantly masturbates into his OWN mouth.

Glad you went there, amateur?
Did you like the part where I cap'd "OWN" to let everyone know with EXTRA EMPHASIS where your manjuice goes?

Carry on. Like that chimp, you certainly don't need ME here for you to continue what it is you do.
 
 
 
Yep, India, No. Korea, Russia and Iran sold them all they needed.

 

Well the article states clearly they had their own program for years but it would be reasonable to speculate that Iran might have helped them. While Iraq was Sunni under Saddam, Iran and Syria were Shia Allies.
Of course, once Bush put in a Shia government, that barrier was eliminated and now all three share the same radical flavor of kool-aid. Wonderful.

The point, of course, was not that their spatial proximity made them friends, you sub-moron.

You have an error in your Obama-Bot programming. Hillary Clinton is claiming Syria has WMD. She is 'Warning' about their WMD. So how do you take her 'Warning' to mean she's stating we shouldn't get more involved? Looks like you got lost in the translation somewhere. What do you think her 'Warning' will lead to? Think about it.

I give you credit for this post and I remember those rumors. I have friends in NIS, ForCon and Cal. There was a lot of speculation and then excuse making but zero was ever substantiated. The thing that I'm sure will be in there somewhere, was all the confusion and obfuscation over whether Iraq was sending WMD's to Syria or they were getting help from Syria's WMD program for their own but again, this never panned out.
The one thing that will be verified if you do searches like that, is that we knew that Syria had their own program - which is my assertation.
 
 
 
 
 
Damn! Now we have to spend another trillion and thousands of lives to invade them too?

 

An Invasion is unlikely. But we will fund and help with the bombing & killing. They should be labelling Assad 'Worse than Hitler' any day now. So stay tuned.

So how do you take her 'Warning' to mean she's stating we shouldn't get more involved? Looks like you got lost in the translation somewhere. What do you think her 'Warning' will lead to? Think about it.

 

So again I do not insult but you do. Not surprising here.

Clinton is not claiming anything. We have known about Syria's WMD programs since the 90's.
The only people suggesting we should get involved are Republicans. From the article cited by the OP:
"Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Joe Lieberman (I-CT), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who issued a statement today urging the administration to start directly aiding the Syrian rebels and protecting Syrian civilians."

The article cited also stated:
"Hillary Clinton said she supported more sanctions on the Assad regime but she declined to endorse any direct help"
So the official stated position of the president and Clinton is that we should not get involved. There are many good reasons for this.

So while you sling little jibes about "others" getting lost in translation, it seems you are projecting.
But I could be wrong. Do you have any evidence whatsoever that Obama or Clinton have said we should get more directly involved?
