MIAMI - Want to know how Sharon Gless scored her 10th Emmy
nomination this year after nearly four decades in the business and
10 series?

Consider the cigarettes.

Onscreen as Madeline Westen, the mother of superspy Michael
Westen on USA Network's Burn Notice, Gless deploys her cigarettes
with style. She soothes herself with a handy drag one moment and
waves a smoldering Marlboro like a weapon the next.

Offscreen, the former Cagney & Lacey star handles cigarettes
the way some people heft a highball at the end of a challenging
day, firing one up during a 45-minute lunch break in her dressing
room-size trailer (though she's nice enough to ask a visiting
reporter before striking the match).

Let those wimps on Mad Men swagger through scenes with
clove-stuffed fabrications in hand. When Gless heard her character
was a smoker, the one thing she knew was that Maddy was going to be
puffing the real thing while helping her superspy son dodge bullets
in the Magic City.

"I've seen some of those other shows, like Mad Men, and you can
tell they're not smokers," said Gless, who preps her scenes with
an acting coach, choreographing exactly how she'll deploy her
cancer sticks in each scene. "I love using this cigarette, because
it says volumes."

Gless must know her business. This month, she became the first
actor on the show to be nominated for a major Emmy, midway through
its fourth season. And her honor came despite a curious habit she
has broken only once in the show's history.

She never watches the program. Or much of anything she has acted
in over her decades-long career, from her role as a quirky mom on
Showtime's gay-centered 2000-era drama Queer as Folk to her last
Emmy-winning performance as NYPD Detective Christine Cagney in the
classic '80s cop show.

"Some people say it's a mistake, but I just try to live in the
moment that I'm playing," said Gless, who broke her longtime rule
just last month during a promotional event for Burn Notice that
featured a screening of the third season finale.

"The older I get, the less I can look," said the star, who
fears she'll see only her shortcomings. "When I saw it, it wasn't
as painful as I thought it would be. But I didn't realize how many
things we blow up."

Showbiz pioneer

Gless, 67, has become the quirky, sentimental heart at one of
cable TV's most unlikely hits. She is an engaging burst of emotion
and comic relief in a role that could easily have become a
stereotypical Florida senior citizen bugging her grown kid when he
gets stuck in God's waiting room.

Instead, Maddy Westen is a flawed mom who couldn't stop her
husband from beating her son as a child. She's often the character
who reminds Jeffrey Donovan's "burned" operative Michael Westen
that there is a human cost to his spy jinks in Miami, most notably
when FBI agents grill her about his activities in scenes from the
third season finale that likely secured Gless' Emmy nod.

On the show's set in mid June, Gless is a down-to-earth pro,
joking with longtime hairstylist Romaine Greene (herself a showbiz
legend who worked on Woody Allen's films for 30 years) and loosing
a choice curse word after the occasional flubbed line.

You'd hardly know she was a bona fide Hollywood pioneer, teaming
with Cagney & Lacey partner Tyne Daly to create the kind of
independent, personally dysfunctional female cop characters viewers
now find everywhere on cable, from TNT's The Closer, Saving Grace
and Rizzoli & Isles to USA's In Plain Sight.

"We were canceled three times," Gless says of Cagney &
Lacey. "Some of our episodes, certain affiliate stations would not
air them. It was a very controversial show in its day," said
Gless, who eventually married the show's executive producer, Barney
Rosenzweig.

Indeed, Gless was the third woman to play Cagney, following
M..A..S..H star Loretta Swit's performance in the original 1981
made-for-TV movie and Meg Foster's incarnation in the show's first
season. For years, the series struggled with low ratings and
accusations that CBS was uncomfortable with the show's messages of
female empowerment. One reported reason Gless got the role is that
network executives feared Foster wasn't feminine enough to counter
impressions the two women were gay.

It took a protest led by the National Organization for Women to
save the show from one of its cancellations.

"Two women in a serious role . . . nobody touched that format
in a cop show but us," Gless said. "Barney said at the time,
women and minorities are always considered amusing. But never do
you see an hour drama carried by them."

Gless enjoyed a brief reunion with Daly last season when her old
acting partner came on Burn Notice to play a woman bamboozled by
Michael Westen and befriended by Maddy. "When the two of us walked
onto the set together, I cannot tell you the reverence and hush
that fell over," she recalled. "I said, ' (Sheesh) guys, I don't
get this kind of attention when I walk in' (laughing). But it's
just the two of us together that does it."

Keeping it real

Viewers will see another big-name cameo Thursday, when actor
Burt Reynolds guest stars as a retired, hard-drinking spy Michael
Westen helps out of a jam. Gless gets one scene with him, where
they improvised ogling each other briefly as they crossed paths.

She plans to continue her special way of working, occasionally
avoiding parts of scripts in which her character doesn't appear.
Gless figures she shouldn't know what Maddy doesn't know. While
filming the pilot in Miami, she didn't even tell producers she and
Rosenzweig had lived on nearby Fisher Island for years, so she
could hang with the cast at the hotel.

For Gless, it's all about keeping the performances as authentic
as possible, because you never know what will resonate with the
audience.

"I've done more series than anyone in the history of the
television academy, and I have no idea what makes a hit," Gless
said, laughing. "Actors . . . we can't take credit for (cast)
chemistry, and we're nothing without the writers. So I've been very
lucky."
