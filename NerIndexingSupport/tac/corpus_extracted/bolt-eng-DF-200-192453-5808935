Before and after satellite images provide evidence of the destruction of villages in Darfur.

I saw the above image and I just felt bad. I know it doesn't add particularly to the facts but, as cliche as it is, it makes you actually realise the facts that little bit more. For those who don't know anything about the whole conflict, see the  BBC's Q and A  which does a pretty good summary. 2.7million people have been displaced and 300,000 killed.

Have we failed Darfur? If Tony Blair had supported intervention in Sudan in 2003 instead of Iraq would you have been behind him?
 
 
We haven't "failed" anybody. It annoys me how people are quick to criticise the government when we get involved in foreign matters, yet many of these people are also the first to complain when those matters inevitably descend into anarchy/genocide. The number one priority at this moment in time should be ensuring economic recovery of our country, and until that is done, foreign aid can take a seat on the sidelines as far as I'm concerned.
 
 
yes the worlds failed darfur.

we have quite a few family friends in NGOs / the UN. we have definitely failed. i dont get how the international community is so crap.
 
 
It isn't our problem at all!

If they want our help they should accept their sovereignity is at an end; and return to colony status.

there wasn't any oil to gain so it wouldn't have mattered to tony... wasn't big on his list of things to do...
 
 
And do what? Half the world would turn around and say the same as they have in Iraq and Afghanistan. You cannot win ether way.

And it annoys me how people are quick to worry more about someone losing a job and having to live on JSA etc. than people dying just because they are British.

Just because you think our comfort is more important than their lives doesn't mean you are right.
 
 
Yes we have failed them. To answer your question I would have and still do support intervention in Darfur.

Excuse me for looking out for the interests of the British tax payer over those whom we have no jurisdiction over...They wanted independence from the British empire 50 years ago, and they got it, end of story.

I really don't care if we have jurisdiction over them or not and I was taking issue with your attitude implying you know best more than anything.

The difference is I wasn't claiming I was right (well I did, but in an obvious mocking way).
 
 
No one failed Darfur except for the Sudanese government.
 
 
We have no business in Darfur. We are not the world police.

Sudan has a lot of oil reserves and refineries LOL.
 
 
People who support intervention in Sudan, but not Iraq - are stinking hypocrites.
 
 
This police mentality were you think you have the responsibility to fix things in this world is detrimental and hypocritical. The UK (and the US) only intervene if they have something to gain.

What did they gain in Iraq and Afghanistan? If you say oil I'm gonna facepalm.

On a very basic level, they have now added to their list of puppet governments who they can control from Washington (probably not London).

They will have forces stationed over there for an eternity, both countries on the doorstep of Iran.

They now pretty much control the financial sector in Iraq, which now deals in Dollars again after it changed it to Euros right before the invasion, this is a huge gain for the USA.

You might facepalm at the mention of oil but if you think it had nothing to do with it then you need to open your eyes.

You know Coalition troops are sort of pulling out of Iraq, and will soon in Afghanistan, yes? You also know that Iraq has relatively free elections, yes? Hence there's no such thing as a puppet government, as it changes every few years.

Also, the long-term bill for Afghanistan and Iraq is estimated at $2.4 trillion. I have a hard time seeing how a switch from euro to dollar in an economy valued at around 66 billion dollars currently (Iraq) could justify an invasion in economical terms. Especially since the total GDP of Afghanistan and Iraq is roughly 80 billion dollars. And that's the total value of the economy, which is not even remotely near what could be extracted hypothetically.

 http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2450753720071024 

Your arguments fail.
 
 
No. They're not our responsibility. We're not Team UK - World Police. We have our own problems without intervening to sort out problems everywhere else in the world.

LOOL  

please don't drag me into an argument  

If you really want to see who profits from war just read the article below:

 http://www.businesspundit.com/the-25...ar-profiteers/ 

First thing I Google'd but I'm sure there are more accurate articles out there, this one seems to be belittling their profits and have left out some important companies.

yes you're right, but I would say that at the time of intervention the exploration had just started and the far more lucrative oil industry in the ME had its economical and geo-politcal advantages.....

who knows what will happen in a few years... the british government may decide to "liberate" the people of sudan!
 
 
The supposed crisis in Darfur is an internal issue for The Sudan. The world has no right to try and destroy the nation, and to force its agenda on Khartoum.

Long live President Omar Al Bashir.
 
 
Darfur? It's about the control of oil, right?

No. And your quote from the Jerusalem Post about Churchill is distorted. Do you ever stop using hate sites? When I googled it, it was Stormfront, Jew-watch and FPP. Now to disect your false quote'

The whole of Kohn's first paragraph, directed at the 'revisionists', is written in a mode of sarcasm. (The rest of the article is a defence of Churchill, who is presented as a model for hard-line Israeli politicians.) Kohn evidently suspected that the revisionists had an underlying anti-semitic motive, and his reference to Churchill's Jewish ancestry may be nothing more than an allusion to some pre-existing anti-semitic rumour or fantasy. On the assumption that Moshe Kohn himself was Jewish - which seems a fair guess - he would hardly have seriously referred to 'cunning... in the Jewish genes': a stereotypical piece of anti-semitic nonsense. But even if Kohn's reference to Churchill's Jewish ancestry was intended seriously, it is of no value as historical evidence, and no competent historian would rely on it without supporting documentation.

 http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/chu...try-not_08.php 

If you read the full paragraph, you'd realise that. And as the article points out, even if you try rationalise it wasn't said in jest (which it clearly was), "There are countless biographies of Churchill, a few of his mother Jenny, and one of his mother's father, Leonard Jerome. On browsing relevant parts of these, I found them unanimous in tracing Churchill's Jerome ancestry back to Timothy Jerome, of Huguenot descent, who migrated to America around 1717"

You do realise that the only historian to quote that David Kohn's Jerusalem Post article is David Irving, right? That's who you're quoting on Jews. That same person who manage to fudge the date. and that same person who managed to distort what was actually said.

So, what is this now, Martyn*, the fourth quote I've shown to be false? Stop reading hate sites.

This is not an opportunity to take a pot-shot. Or is it? I wasn't aware of any distortion, but thanks for pointing that out. I will look at this and, if need be, I will take action.

It's not a pot shot. It's pointing out that you, again, are using distorted or falsified quotes. You can do whatever the hell you want - whether you "take action" or not doesn't change the fact that Churchill was not Jewish and that quote is distorted and used by hate-sites.

I didn't get that quote from a hate-site. I got it from a Forum.

Which was probably quoting a hate site. In fact, what you're saying is even worse - that you consider a forum a good source for a statement on Churchill's background. While hate sites are bad, the fact that you decided to take this quote from a forum without checking against any other sources says a lot about you.

And if you did check it against other sources - then you must have seen the hate sites. So there are two options: either you're really gullible and take quotes from forums (and indirectly quote hate sites) or you quote hate sites.

Sometimes I do take quotes from Forums. To be sure I always google the quote. Not a good idea, I know. But thanks for pointing it out.
 
 
I'd have supported this 100%. Was actually at a conference thing at a Holocaust centre when I was a kiddo and spoke about this
 
 
What a hilarious suggestion. Blair would have had nothing to gain from supporting an intervention in Sudan.

Oh, great, so you want to go to war and displace another genocidal tinpot dictator. I think the sizable and far more affluent Arabic population who are supportive of Omar al-Bashir wouldn't take too kindly to that. Or China and the middle east for that matter.

Like it or not we're in no position to go to war against every tyrant, and even if we were the benefits of doing so for the country in question and for us are usually non-existent.

Well at least you acknowledge that it's not a "good idea." And if you had googled this quote, then it only proves my point: stop reprinting what hate sites say.
 
 
I support Sudan's unity.
 
 
I lol at the "after the fact" noobs weighing in with "we should have done this and that"

Fact is no one gives 2 squirts of the finest urine about Sudan or most of Africa, especially the bits that are basically waste land.

Congo on the other hand would be stupendously epic. It's actually worth sorting out, colonising and ruling.
 
 
Oh God, not another liberal interventionist guilt trip.

This is not our problem.

Iraq was not our problem.

Afghanistan is no longer our problem.

I'm sick of our troops being sent to help these ungrateful people, who cause enough problems in our country never mind their own.

For once why doesn't Africa do something?!

Instead of constantly telling us how we're horrible imperialists but then play the victim card when they want us to sort out their self-made problems.

Right, rant over.

"LA LA LA LA *Fingers in ears* I don't care who's killing who, I don't care about tyrants and genocides, I don't care about tens of thousands of people displaced because I live in the UK and I don't have to deal with it... LA LA LA LA."

Are these really your beliefs? People like you are a blot on humanity - you are nothing but an apologist for the most evil of people, hiding underneath a blanket of "it's not our problem." Why is it not our problem? Because there's a big ocean between us and the millions dying? Because our borders end at Dover and who cares what happens after that?

Oh cry me a river, build a bridge and get over it.

We don't have the time, manpower or resources to do what you want.

Why can you not accept this?

I think the barbaric practices of certain recent Islamic immigrants (Honour killings, forced marriages and generally abusing our freedoms) are a far bigger concern than groups of people thousands of miles away who've been killing each other for centuries.

You also seem to be slightly contradicting the non-interventionist spirit of libertarianism.

Perhaps they wouldn't have come to the UK if the UK hadn't colonised their land... if that was the case then the UK wouldn't be prosperous as it is now as it wouldn't have exploited the resources needed. Maybe you need to read on history before you spout your typical EDL crap.

So it's ok for them to practice honour killings, forced marriage and burn poppies because of what our ancestors did?

If you hate the UK so much why do you live here?

Can you highlight the bit in my post where I said I hated the UK?

Those that practice honour killings get life and those that practice forced marriages is for stupid cultural reasons which lands them in jail as well. A few fruitloops burned the poppy but an entire community who were muslims raised money for the poppy appeal.

Who gives a ****? It's no bodies business to take sides on a civil unrest in another country. So some people in Darfur wants to kill some other people there. Big whoop. It's their country, we should be selling them weapons instead so we can court the eventual victor for minerals deals.

How about the bit where you justified these barbaric practices coming to the UK with colonialism that happened centuries ago?

Honour Killings aren't limited to Islam but they're VERY prevalent in areas which just so happen to be devoutly Islamic.

I did notice that moderate Muslims turned up en masse to protest against the poppy burning.  
 
 
 
Wish you replied before it did... would have saved me a post!

 

Actually you'll find that most of these Islamic immigrants came AFTER colonialism ended.

And because their countries quickly went down the pan due to corruption and internal strife of their own making.

Oh sure we do, in the future. But I support this in principle and not necessarily in practice. I do think that the liberation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and our intervention in the Balkans was justified and saved the lives of millions.

Luckily enough we live in a Westernised country with a decent legal system that will take care of these people - unlike foreign countries which you want to just ignore. If you think these practises are barbaric, why do you only care about them if they happen in the UK? Do they suddenly become not barbaric when it happens abroad?

 
You also seem to be slightly contradicting the non-interventionist spirit of libertarianism.
 

I don't care. I think that spirit is wrong. In fact, I don't see how the idea of spreading liberty to those who have never experienced it is against the principles of libertarianism.

We've tried to stamp out these barbaric practices but it hasn't worked.

If anything they've got worse in Iraq and Afghanistan.

No it hasn't! Do you honestly think things are now worse under the UK and the USA than they were under the Taleban and the Baathist regime? You think that the genocidal Saddam, who invaded his neighbouring states, gassed his own people, acquired WMDs and launched a biological attack on his Kurdish citizens, is better than the occupying powers? You think that the Taleban and their oppression of women and murdering of foreigners is better than the occupying powers? What planet are you on?

Christians could worship relatively freely under Saddam, while women could hold positions in government. Perpetrators of honour killings were also punished.

Christians are now murdered en masse, while women are killed if they don't wear the veil and have to quit their jobs due to threats of violence and perpetrators of honour killings go unpunished.

As for oppression of women under the Taliban, how's the current situation any better?

Men are now legally allowed to rape their wives, while general violence against women is higher than it has ever been.

And what about those who are still sentenced to death for apostasy?

Look it up if you don't believe me, and then tell me it was worth it.

Christians can still worship freely and women can still hold governmental positions. As for the treatment of women under Saddam...

Spoiler:
"By 1990 Hussein was courting support for his war¬weary regime from neighboring Islamic states and from religious and tribal leaders. Hussein’s public embrace of Islam’s moral authority changed many of the laws gov¬erning divorce, child custody, and inheritance rights so as to limit women’s rights and freedoms. Laws restrict¬ed women’s ability to travel abroad without a male rela¬tive and reintroduced single¬sex education in high school. The GFIW stopped promoting women’s rights to work and education and focused primarily on humanitarian aid and health care. Honor killings of women who were suspected of pre¬marital sex or vic¬tims of rape, thereby “dishonoring” the family name, dramatically increased after Hussein reduced the prison sentences of male perpetrators from 8 years to no more than 6 months—a punishment in any case rarely imposed. And the government’s brutalization of women contin¬ued. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1991 and the sub¬sequent Gulf War ended with U.S. President George W. Bush urging the Kurds and Shi’a, whose religious activ¬ities were strictly regulated by the Ba’athists, to rise up against Hussein’s government. They did so—unsuccess¬fully. During and after the uprisings, government forces killed thousands of people, including women and chil¬dren, who were also allegedly used by government forces as “human shields.” By 2000, a militia founded by Hussein’s son, Uday, was beheading women in a cam¬paign against prostitution. According to the World Health Organization, prior to the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq’s health conditions and health system were among the best in the Middle East. The degradation of the system and the health of the popula¬tion began during the Iran¬Iraq war and seriously accel¬erated during the 13 years of United Nations sanctions that followed the 1991 war. Between 1991¬1997, the government could only supply 10¬15% of the country’s medical needs, material and human. The Oil¬for¬Food Program, instituted in 1997, allowed the Iraqi govern¬ment to sell oil and use the revenues to obtain humani¬tarian aid. But the health care system never really recovered, and women paid the price. Pregnant Iraqis had to rely heavily on emergency obstetric care, prena¬tal care all but disappeared, and skilled delivery person¬nel were scarcely available. No wonder that maternal mortality tripled. At the same time, increasing poverty and poor nutrition undermined all women’s health, as it did men’s. Approximately 60% of the population became dependent on rations handed out by the gov¬ernment and paid for by the oil¬for¬food program."

Killings of Christians are not legal in present day Iraq and there is no law mandating the wearing of the veil. Honour killings are the exception to the rule.

I'm surprised that you have neglected to mention the fact that there are no more genocides in Iraq! You're akin to someone arguing that the invasion of Nazi Germany was pointless because, although we stopped the genocide, there are still a few murders here and there. Get real. The Kurds are no longer being killed  thousands at a time , in fact they have their own autonomous province in Iraq. Kuwait is now safe from Saddam's expansionist desires and the people who live in other neighbouring countries no longer fear Saddam trying to invade them.

 
As for oppression of women under the Taliban, how's the current situation any better?

Men are now legally allowed to rape their wives, while general violence against women is higher than it has ever been.

And what about those who are still sentenced to death for apostasy?
 

Yes, that's because Karzai is a nutter. The only reason he was able to pass these laws is because he rigged the election - an election that wouldn't have even taken place under the Taleban. There is room for improvement, but the situation, even that of women, is much better now than it ever was.

 
Look it up if you don't believe me, and then tell me it was worth it.
 

It was worth it.
 
 
[QUOTE=JakePearson;28501271] Christians can still worship freely and women can still hold governmental positions. As for the treatment of women under Saddam...

You mean like last week when Christians were murdered in their church by islamic militants. That's a very strange definition of worshipping freely.

As for women:

No, Iraqi Christians, women and gays are being killed instead.

I honestly don't see why it's worth sending troops to die for rigged elections that mean bugger all anyway.

Once again, men being allowed to rape their wives is not an improvement:

Afghanistan and Iraq can go to hell as far as I'm concerned, what goes around comes around.

Again, there is a difference between violent actions sanctioned under the law and violent actions that are illegal. There are efforts being made to combat these militants and their actions in killing Christians are not legally sanctioned - unlike Saddam's genocide.

There have been a few illegal incidents in which these groups have been targetted. Compare this to Saddam's wholescale genocide of the Kurds, his poison gas attacks on Kurdish villages, his murder of about 50,000 of Iraq's Shi'a population, his 8 year occupation of Iran in the 80s when he used poison gas many more times bringing the death toll to about a million and his invasion of Kuwait which resulted in about 75,000 deaths. Are you honestly saying that we should just sit back and do nothing when this man attempted to purchase WMDs? You talk of British interests being at the forefront of our foreign policy - do you not think that a genocidal Islamist maniac gaining WMDs in the age of terrorism is against our interests? How many more would you have preffered to have murdered and exterminated because it "isn't worth it" to spill the blood of our troops? A million more? A couple of million more on top of that? How long would you sit by and let this man invade Kuwait again, exterminate all the Kurds and gain an even tighter grip on his people. Answer those questions and don't try to dodge them.

I already mentioned this.

Sums your attitude up completely - you don't give a **** about genocide because you're not involved. Despicable.

Saddam was not linked with Al Qaeda, and greatly distrusted Islamist groups.

As for the genocide, aren't the Iraqis just as at fault for not stopping it?

Why didn't other countries in the region do anything?

Why is it always up to us to do something?

I don't care about these countries because they've shown they'll never change. They'll still treat women like cattle, and just find new minority groups to persecute.

They'll play pretend at democracy for a while return to their tyrannical roots.

If one group of brutal fanatics wants to kill another group of brutal fanatics then so be it. Innocents should get out of the way.

Take your I'm-so-holier-than-you-since-I'm-a-liberal preaching elsewhere, I once believed in your ideals but eventually saw how hopeless they were.

This is debatable but either way it does not matter - he was dangerous, an Islamist and was seeking to acquire WMDs. Have no doubt that he'd use them just as he used poison gas against the Kurds and the Iranians.

 
As for the genocide, aren't the Iraqis just as at fault for not stopping it?
 

And how do you suggest the Iraqi people get rid of their tyrant? They didn't have the manpower, the freedom to organise or any elections to vote him out.

 
Why didn't other countries in the region do anything?
 

Again, Arab nations are notoriously bad at organising themselves on the international state. They didn't have the manpower nor the money.

 
Why is it always up to us to do something?
 

Because the USA and the UK are two very powerful military nations.

 
I don't care about these countries because they've shown they'll never change. They'll still treat women like cattle, and just find new minority groups to persecute.
 

They'll never change if we sit back and let these tyrants get on with it. The only way they'll ever change is if we intervene for the better and secure a democracy.

 
They'll play pretend at democracy for a while return to their tyrannical roots.

You really don't know anything about this at all, do you? The Kurds were not brutal fanatics, the Shia population were not brutal fanatics, Kuwait were not brutal fanatics and everyone else that got in Saddam's way were not brutal fanatics - they were the innocents.

 
Take your I'm-so-holier-than-you-since-I'm-a-liberal preaching elsewhere, I once believed in your ideals but eventually saw how hopeless they were.

And you didn't answer my questions. Here they are again, I'd like an answer...

How many more would you have preffered to have murdered and exterminated because it "isn't worth it" to spill the blood of our troops? A million more? A couple of million more on top of that? How long would you sit by and let this man invade Kuwait again, exterminate all the Kurds and gain an even tighter grip on his people?

Why don't you answer mine?

How are countries which are still barbaric hellholes despite the best and well-intentioned efforts of our troops worth dying for?

How is Afghanistan, a country led by a corrupt, nepotistic, election rigging moron where men are allowed to rape their wives worth one drop of British blood?

How is Iraq, a country where the corrupt, deathsquad-using government which turns a blind eye to violence against Christians and women and the people kill each other because they're a different sect of the same religion worth one drop of British blood?

How am I meant to feel any sympathy for these countries?

As much as you'd like to be so, we did not go into Iraq to stop genocide.

Genocide wasn't part of the rationale for war so it's absurd to discuss it as a justification.

When Saddam was at his most bloodthirsty the Yankee Doodles were happily supplying with guns and money.

It was only when he outlived his usefulness they decided to get rid of him.

How is saving people from a genocide not worth dying for? That's my answer - don't worry, it's a rhetorical question.

 
How is Afghanistan, a country led by a corrupt, nepotistic, election rigging moron where men are allowed to rape their wives worth one drop of British blood?
 

The conditions now are better than under the Taleban and our troops are still fighting to ensure that this 'moron' doesn't gain any more influence.

It doesn't turn a blind eye, I've told you this. Violence against Christians, women and other sects is illegal and the government, with the help of the US, are trying to combat it. Just because there are murders in this country doesn't mean the police turn a blind-eye, does it?

 
How am I meant to feel any sympathy for these countries?
 

I hoped some basic human empathy for victims of genocide and oppression might shine through. Obviously you're a basket case.

Genocide was part of the justification - Blair talked about liberating the Iraqis from Saddam back in 1997. There were other justifications for the war too, such as Saddam's non-complience with UN inspections, violation of UN resolutions, acquiration of WMDs etc etc.

 
When Saddam was at his most bloodthirsty the Yankee Doodles were happily supplying with guns and money.

It was only when he outlived his usefulness they decided to get rid of him.
 

There were sanctions on Iraq from August 6th 1990 up until May 22nd 2003, as voted for unanimously by the UN Security Council of which the USA is a member. It was the French, actually, that provided Saddam with arms.

Our troops are dying to protect Karzai's disgusting, corrupt regime.

Are these the same 'vcitims of oppression' who've been tearing Iraq apart with violence for the last 7 years?

No, those who have been tearing apart Iraq have been a very small minority of Islamists unhappy with the presence of Western forces and unhappy with the democracy that Iraq now is.

 
I was referring to the 1980s.
 

And they changed their policy. Isn't it better that they change their policy when new administrations come along than keep the old, wrong one? At least the USA realised where they had gone wrong, took responsibility and invaded Iraq in the 90s.
 
 
 
No, those who have been tearing apart Iraq have been a very small minority of Islamists unhappy with the presence of Western forces and unhappy with the democracy that Iraq now is.

 

I'd hardly call a country that enshrines Sharia Law in its constitution and has government-backed death squads torturing, raping and killing at will a democracy.

Do you know anything about Iraq's legal system other than what you've read on a blog or something similar? And the government does not have death squads torturing, raping and killing at will.
