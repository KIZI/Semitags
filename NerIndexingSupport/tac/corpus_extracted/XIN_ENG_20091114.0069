Pakistani Taliban warned on Saturday that they will increase suicide attacks in
the country if the government did not review its policies.

Qari Hussain, the mastermind of suicide attacks and spokesman for Taliban chief
Hakimullah Mehsood, challenged the government to stop the wave of suicide
attacks if it can.

He claimed responsibility for the Friday's suicide attacks on the office of the
intelligence agency ISI in Peshawar and police station in the city of Bannu.

Upto 20 people were killed and 60 others were injured in the attacks on the ISI
office and police station.

Hussain told the BBC Urdu service that the ISI office was targeted as secret
agencies have a major role in the government policy-making.

"These attacks are reaction to the military operation in Waziristan and
Pakistan's help and joining the anti-terror campaign," he said.

About the military operation in South Waziristan, the Taliban leader said that
the fighters have retreated under a strategy. " The strategy is aimed at saving
our manpower and weapons for guerrilla war in the region," Hussain said.

He said Taliban will soon launch guerrilla war against the Pakistan army in
South Waziristan.
