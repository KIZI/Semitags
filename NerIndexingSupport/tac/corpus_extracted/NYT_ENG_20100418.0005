Is Toronto Canada's coolest city? Modest and self-deprecating,
Torontonians will forever shy away from any such depiction,
pointing to Montreal as the center of all things cool in Canada.

But Toronto, or "T Dot" (a nickname coined by local rap
artists), has long since surpassed Montreal as Canada's cultural
hub. But only in recent times has it seen its sense of
self-confidence grow along with its size.

With new investments in infrastructure, an influx of
suburbanites into the downtown core and hundreds of new
restaurants, bars and cafes opening every month, Toronto is
undergoing a renaissance from a dour business hub to Canada's most
vibrant and dynamic city.

While Vancouver remains too clean, almost utopic, Calgary too
conservative and Montreal enjoys an elegant decline, Toronto has
become Canada's true capital -- of business, finance, arts and
sports -- in everything but formal title.

And best of all, it's still growing: dozens of skyscrapers under
construction, a Frank Gehry-designed art gallery just opened, a new
opera house, and a recently refurbished city square which is, well,
cleaner than Times Square. New York, "without all the stuff" as
Toronto has been called, is looking cooler than ever.

Here's where to find what's cool in T Dot:

      QUEEN WEST (AND WEST, AND WEST)

Queen Street West has been the center of English-speaking
Canada's alternative arts scene since the 1980s, having replaced
the now uber-posh Yorkville neighborhood, once Canada's hippy
haven.

Block by block, storefront by storefront, the "commercial" has
chased the "indie" westwards down Queen Street into once derelict
areas which have now become home to Toronto's so-called "creative
class." The neighborhood's dozens of galleries are anchored by the
recently opened Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art (952 Queen St.
W.). Surrounding the museum is an abundance of small contemporary
art and photo galleries such as Clint Roenisch Gallery (944 Queen
St. W.), 107Shaw Gallery (107 Shaw St.) or Stephen Bulger Gallery
(1026 Queen St. W.).

As for grub, it has been said that there is nothing one can't
find on Queen Street -- from Tibetan to Jamaican. For some of the
best roti this side of Guyana, try Bacchus Roti Shop (1376 Queen
St. W.), which serves up the gargantuan wraps stuffed with creamy
sweet potato and chickpeas. For dinner try Harlem Underground (745
Queen St. W.), a jazzy soul food spot that has some of Toronto's
best chicken and ribs.

At night the all-season rooftop lounge at the Drake Hotel (1150
Queen St. W.) is usually buzzing with cocktail swilling
30-somethings while the underground bar has live music on weekends.

For a younger crowd that likes to dance, head to The Social
(1100 Queen St. W.), a hipster nightspot that is quickly becoming a
Queen Street legend. Check local listings for concerts at the
legendary Horseshoe Tavern (368 Queen St. W.) where Canadian acts
such as the The Band, the Tragically Hip and Bryan Adams got their
break.

For a needed after-bar noshing, try Poutini's House of Poutine
(1112 Queen St. W.) for Canada's favorite post-club chow, which is
hand-cut fries, squeaky cheese curds and piping hot gravy poured
over top.

LESLIEVILLE

A once poverty-stricken neighborhood between downtown and the
tony Beaches neighborhood, Leslieville, has been revitalized,
revamped and not so subtly gentrified with condos, restaurants and
coffee shops sprouting up along the mile or so stretch. Its gritty
past lives on in smoky bars, decrepit gas stations and the iconic
Jilly's strip club, yet remnants of those times are fading by the
day. No trip to Leslieville is complete without a visit to
Dangerous Dan's Diner (714 Queen St. E.), a dive that serves up
some of the city's juiciest burgers with thick slices of bacon and
two eggs on top.

Walk those calories off by exploring Leslieville's many small
boutiques such as Nathalie-Roze and Co. (1050 Queen St. E.) that
offers clothing, crafts and "I Love Leslieville" t-shirts to show
your pride. After an espresso at one of the neighborhood's bohemian
cafes (try Te-Aro Roasted (983 Queen St. E.), Dark Horse Espresso
Bar (682 Queen St. E) or Mercury Espresso Bar (915 Queen St. E.)),
head to Tomi-Kro (1214 Queen St. E.) for Asian-fusion dinner with
deliciously pretentious dishes such as the rich and creamy duck
liver creme brule.

Nightlife in Leslieville is subdued -- more fitting for an
evening stroll than for bobbing to Indie Rock. On a warm evening
have a house-made ice cream bar on the tranquil backyard patio at
the earnestly named Cream: The Urban Dairy (1298 Queen St. E.).

KENSINGTON MARKET

Kensington Market could be said to represent the most
concentrated form of Toronto's postwar identity as a melting pot of
immigrants looking for a better life. From Jewish immigrants from
Eastern Europe to American draft dodgers during the Vietnam era,
Kensington epitomizes Toronto's role as Canada's port of arrival
for the world's downtrodden. Kensington's special place in Canadian
history was recognized in 2006 when it became a National Historic
site. Yet far from being a tourist trap, Kensington's streets still
evoke the sounds and smells of far off places.

A visit to Kensington first requires a stop at the ramshackle
Luis Coffee Stop (235 Augusta Ave.) next to the Casa Acoreana nut
shop to people watch over a Chai Latte. Next, head down Kensington
Ave. to check out the colorful thrift shops that have overrun the
ornate Victorian houses that line the block. Though pot is
technically illegal in Canada, you would not know it from strolling
through the streets of Kensington, particularly near Roach-o-Rama
(191A Baldwin St.), whose cafe/boutique is a mecca for aficionados.
Kensington offers Toronto's funkiest dining at bargain prices.
Nightlife in Kensington has been made famous by its backroom
"afterhours" parties that are known only through word of mouth.
For the less daring Supermarket (268 Augusta Ave.) and The Boat
(158 Augusta Ave.) both guarantee a messy night on the town.

THE JUNCTION

Being cool means staying ahead of the curve. Most Torontonians
have scarcely heard of the Junction neighborhood on the city's
northwest frontier, yet the post-industrial hood is soon to be the
city's "next big thing."' Once a railway factory town -- a home to
foundries, mills and meat packers -- the Junction fell into decline
after the Great Depression. Though still an area in transition,
adventurous visitors might want to make the journey to watch the
city transform before their eyes.

Axis Gallery and Grill (3048 Dundas St. W.) is a local favorite
for live music and reasonably priced brew. If it seems wrong to eat
a tepid meal that is entirely raw and vegan in cold Canada,
Rawlicious (3092 Dundas St. W.) serves versions of spaghetti
Bolognese and pad thai that might change your mind. Lovers of used
books and records should head to Pandemonium (2862 Dundas St. W.),
the store that kicked off the Junction's trendy rebirth. Though the
immediate neighborhood has yet to develop an active nightlife
Hugh's Room (2261 Dundas St. W.), just south of the neighborhood
has a dedicated clientele and live music on most nights of the
week.

Most Torontonians would balk at such a limited view of what is
"cool" in their city and would no doubt have their own laundry
lists of things to do. Yet, peculiarly, few Torontonians are
willing to admit that their city has become a wellspring of
creativity and culture. Indeed, it is time to stop asking if
Toronto is cool and start telling others how cool it really is.
