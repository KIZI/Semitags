Who the fuck does this Mayor think he is?

 San Francisco starts soda ban as soda tax still pending in Michigan Legislature | MLive.com 
 
 
 
The San Francisco policy, the result of an executive order from Mayor Gavin Newsom, dictates vending machines on city property can no longer dispense Coke, Pepsi and other calorically sweetened beverages. Sports drinks and artificially sweetened water also are included in the ban.

Juices must be 100 percent fruits or vegetables with no added sweeteners.

Like others pushing bans or so-called "fat taxes," Newsom's goal is a thinner, healthier citizenry.
 
What an ass!

I wonder if he owns stock in the juice company.

Immie
 
 
Ah the wonders of liberal Freedom eh.
 
 
God I hate liberals.
 
 
Grocery stores can still sell them.

And will do so in large quantities.

Also restaurants. Newsome is a restaurant owner.

Ahh so it was a giveaway to Grocery store owners and restaurants. Now I get it lol. Figures, Nothing is ever as it seems when Libs are involved.
 
 
It shan't be long until they'll be removed from the outside of shops, or of course not within X number of feet of a school. Next, there will be a minimum age in which to buy. Wouldn't surprise me.

Given San Francisco is arguably the birthplace of Aids, I find it odd that thin is equated with healthy?
 
 
Call it pop. Problem solved.

Wait, I thought if it was illegal, you can't tax it.

Kalifornia is confusing.
 
 
 
God I hate liberals.
 
You're both fucking morons.

In other words.. Charlie Bass started AIDS

Black market pop, that's funny.

And Puke, you're a weird, racist fuck.

Nothing remotely "liberal" about this policy.

It's authoritarian, not liberal.

You are correct, and SF is not liberal, they are Progressive.
 
 
It's ironic that soda is is now illegal in CA but pot isn't.

I guess we'll be replacing the DEA with the Soda Pop Cops
 
 
Sodas and "juice drinks", which used to use sugar, are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup. It's cheaper to produce and much more harmful than cane sugar.
 
 
 
Pssst!

Not unless it's real coca-cola classic....

I'd call many of them authoritarian socialists
 
 
San Francisco has been slowly morphing into a fascist state for some time now. This is not surprising. They're getting exactly what they voted for so let 'em have it.
 
 
SF is a nanny city.
 
 
Scratch a leftist, find a dictator-wannabe.

That would be a good label for many of them. They would almost be Marxists, except that oddly they purport to believe in a god, even as they attempt to be their own god.

More Stalinist than Marxist, IMO.

There rhetoric makes me strongly suspect they love the idea of  collectivization

Live in CA long enough and it begins to make perfect sense.

I imagine you can enjoy Hell with the right attitude.  
 
 
The interesting thing about this is that it does not say anything about "diet" sodas or sports drinks.

A "diet" soda would fit the guidelines of a non "calorically sweetened beverages"
 
 
Just wait, future headline....

LOL and some would take that as a joke, its not. Given the chance that is EXACTLY what SF would try and do.
