hey, careful jumping the bandwagon, I hurt my knee getting on the Texans...  
 
 
Romo's the biggest choke artist in history. biggest collapse in cowboys history.
 
 
I want to know by what freakish pile of puppy poo all my fantasy football opponents every week seem to put on their A game for me while sucking versus everyone else?

That said... Go Pack Go.
 
 
Thank you thank you thank you thank you. That made up for the embarrassment from last week.

A special shout out WOOO HOOO to Wilfork for his second interception this season! Run Wilfork, run!
 
 
 
Romo's the biggest choke artist in history. biggest collapse in cowboys history.

 

I never figured out what the Cowboys saw in him. There was a reason he was not drafted.
 
 
OH MY GAWD!

A-Rodge ROCKS!!!! So happy he is on one of my teams. Wish I had him on the other.

That was a better performance than even Favre ever did.
 
 
Hail to the Redskins.... Hail Victory...
 
 
 NFL - Standings - Yahoo! Sports 

How about them Cowboys, Colts and Eagles.

Of course, What do you expect from a CAL Golden Bear?

Damn, beating the lambs is so something to crow about.

Tell the other 27 teams that overlooked him when drafted, especially San Fran.

Correct. I wanted him, the Niners went with Smith. All in all going to the pack was the best thing for him, Sing and the Niner front office would have ruined him.

and a major concern was mobility in and out of the pocket. 2 rushing touchdowns today. Loved what Larry McCarren had to say: "You know, we should send some flowers to the Niners one of these days."

You should send more than flowers, remember Holmgren came from SF and so did the packs current coach.
 
 
OK, after a 4 and 0 start. 3 Road wins, and 2 of the biggest comebacks in Club History.

I guess I will say it.

GO LIONS

May they be undefeated till they face the Packers and then go down in flames and be swept in that series. But kill the bears and vikings all you want.

Flowers? Chocolates? Promises I don't intend to keep?

Anything on that list look good?

Hehe,

At Home VS the Bears Next week

Clearly looks like its going to be the Lions and Packers going at the title this year.

I will say this from what I have seen of the lions so far, If anyone is going to be hard for them. It's The Pack and Rogers.
 
 
How 'bout them Cowboys!
 

bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha
 
 
 
How 'bout them Cowboys!

The best trade/cut the cowboys could make is Jerry Jones.

I'm going to that game monday night. I'm a bears fan. Oh well. I can look forward to Greektown anyway.  
 
 
 
Oh and Reid? he needs to go.

 

10-4 that!
But F-A-T chance of that happening, as Reid is also General Manager too, now. He has the owner wrapped around his chubby finger.

Only Andy Reid could oversee such failure with this caliber of personnel.

I hate him so fucking much.

But he will easily become my favorite Eagles coach of all time if he wins a super bowl

We'll see!!!!  
I think they play the packers in November?
One thing for sure now, just because the other team is way ahead it means nothing with the Lions! They're awesome this year!!!!!!!!!!!

I think we play the Packers in Detroit on T-Day, and then at Lameau on the last week of the regular season, Jan 1. That first game oughta be something, the Lions did well against the Pack last year in the Det, knocked Rodgers out of the game. Big game for sure.
 
 
For me to be convinced the Lions have what it takes to beat the Packers, they're going to have to start Dominating, not overcoming.

The Packers have dominated every game this year even when their defense is giving up 400-500 yards a game. Best QB in the game right now, with a receiving corps that leaves you little hope and a pair of powerful running backs. Cover Jennings, Nelson beats you. Cover him, Finley beats you. Cover him, Jones beats you. Cover him, Starks or Grant pound you. Score, Cobb is waiting to run it back. And if you manage to cover everyone, Rodgers runs for 10-15.

The Lions are a tough team, but I don't see how they can do any better, and this is a big maybe, and that is split the series with Green Bay. They will be a WC contender if they don't have their patented mid season meltdown, but too many come from behind wins tells me they aren't going to win the division.

At this point in the season, there's the good (Lions)/ the bad (Vikings)/ and then the ugly (Eagles).

I thought they played the week before T-Day....have to check it out! Our neighbors are big Packers fans too....we always get into!   Can't wait!!!!

No there's no way the vikings could be better than us. They have McNabb now and we don't. I'm not convinced about detroit though. They don't just bang out 4 wins and get automatic respect after all this failure.

we have the personnel to make a huge run still. How we get into the playoffs isn't really as important as just getting in. We should match up well against anyone when were playing to potential. Ball protection and tackling is what's killing us. That's a coaching problem because at the NFL level there's no excuse for those issues out of players.
 
 
Paulie, we gotta go 9-3 the rest of the season just to get a wildcard spot. Don't see Reid righting the gaping holes in the defense on this years ship.
Hell, we got run over last week by a wounded Frank Gore! Ugly, just ugly!

I don't know about that though. In the NFC east this year 9-7 could be enough to win it. Neither the Redskins or that Giants have me convinced. The Giants SHOULD only be 2-2 because obviously we shouldn't have lost that game.

Regardless though, this Eagles team really shouldn't have a problem going 9-3, considering that they should be 3-1 at the very worst right now.

A. You need Vick to stay healthy

B. You need Romo to miss some games.

Redskins will win the division, will beat us next week, as our defense re-defines what swiss cheese really is as they did again in Buffalo today.
 
 
its week 5 now people....
