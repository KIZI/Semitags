Morocco said Friday it was providing hospital treatment for wounded Guinean
junta leader Captain Moussa Dadis Camara "for strictly humanitarian reasons."

A foreign ministry statement also said Rabat had been given no warning that
Camara was being flown to Morocco from Conakry after being shot and wounded by
his aide de camp.

"The kingdom of Morocco has learned that Captain Moussa Dadis Camara has taken,
without prior consultation, a plane put at his disposal by the president of
Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, to come to Morocco, accompanied by a Senegalese
doctor, for hospitalisation and medical exams after his bullet wounds," a
statement said.

"In light of this development and for strictly humanitarian reasons, Morocco
will receive President Dadis Camara, to give him the necessary care in a
Moroccan hospital environment."

Camara on Thursday survived an assassination bid by his aide de camp, Lieutenant
Aboubacar Sidiki Diakite, who has since gone into hiding according to officials
in Conakry.

The junta leader's aides said that he was "doing well" and "fine" after the
attack, though military sources said he sustained a head wound.

"The head of state is fine, he had his breakfast and met with his chiefs of
staff," Camara's spokesman Idrissa Cherif said.
