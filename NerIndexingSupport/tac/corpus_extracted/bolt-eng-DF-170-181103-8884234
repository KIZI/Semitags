Forget the current politicians for a minute. And forget Paul and his son too (since this thread will just turn into a fight).

Do you see anyone on the horizon that could potentially lead us out of our financial mess? I understand that it would have to be a joint effort by Congress and the Presidency but wanted to know if there was anyone out there that even has a chance of saving us from the massive debt that hangs around all of our necks. Do you see anyone that is fiscally responsible?

Not a soul.

How far will the debt take us?................ All the way to the crash.

The US will be screwing someone over, mainly us.

And this trend will continue until we either drive the wheels off or the people ditch the neoconserative imperial agenda and the neosocialist entitlement agenda. I don't see that happening any time soon. It's a shame, but there are ways to insulate yourself from the inevitable economic trouble this country is in for.

that would mean that a majority of us would have to start voting only for fiscally responsible people (regardless of party). do you see that happening?
 
 
We have to get the monied interests out of our politics first. As long as there are lobbyists...ain't gonna happen.

Superb question on a draconian topic. I've been debating and exchanging on this on a non public NASA forum for paydown at some point.

But it is now to a point that one must see what this number is.

$15,219,833,880,095 as of this morning.

15,219,833,880,095 seconds is 491,175.52 years

At one million dollars a second paydown, it is till going to take 200 years to pay down this debt.

We must pay this down to zero ASAP and get balanced, for we shall fade into oblivion if not. The Big Herd must look at this as their own debt in the sense of preserving the republic.

It would be tragic to let The Great Idea, fade into oblivion due to a bounced check to ourselves. With this, 72% of the planet would fade into darkness with us. We are the engine, for the long view.

We must hail the speed break, and get into black territory, or we are doomed to a mirage of what we were.

The majority voted Bill Clinton into Office.

He began to reduce the debt with the 1993 budget reduction act.

NOT ONE R SIGNED IT!

Then the republican party cheated in 2000 to win the election.

Now you wnt to blame the American people for what they didnt vote for?

Paul and possibly his son are among the few that would reduce the debt.

I'd add Gary Johnson and possibly Huntsman too.

There may be others, but it sure as hell ain't any of the frontrunners in the current race.

Don't forget, you need a compliant congress too. The Presidency is not enough.

Thread about which party has the prettiest girls = 196 replies

and we blame the politicians for the fiscal mess we're in.
 
 
For some reason it's very hard to get someone in that fiscally responsible. Since it takes a majority of reps in Congress to control the purse strings, that's the most important. The harder part is keeping them focused on it and not wandering off to do some social caca that means so little just to keep themselves busy.

As far as the future goes.. Cristi would be a good Pres and possibly Jindahl.
 
 
Bill Gates, Steve Jobs (RIP), Jack Welch, every small business owner in America, the Financial sector....

Economic growth paired with restrained inflation will get our debt under control.
 
 
^^ Ditto, on the second point anyway. The only way to get the debt sustainable is to promote growth and yes - inflating your way out of debt to some degree.
 
 
 
Paul Ryan

 

I agree. With a free hand Ryan could straighten this mess out. I doubt he would get that free hand though.

Entitlements are the elephant in the room and none of the Clowns in DC, except for Ryan, want to touch the hot potatoe. None of them want to make the hard choices.

With the wars ending they will also cut the military, boots on the ground, big time. More folks coming home to no jobs.

This country is in one big mess and the Clowns we keep electing to govern are more concerned with themselves than they are the taxpayers of America.

There is no bottomless pit of money and one has to wonder if the Clowns in DC realize that??

My guess is No.

What they should do is print enough money to pay it. Then they should rework the IRS system of taxation taking out all the loopholes that rich people and corporations use to avoid taxation. Then a strict "balanced budget" amendment should be added to the constitution which absolutely makes it impossible to go in debt. Don't hold your breath.

None, gov't will never be fixed and a revolution isn't possible.

I know it sounds scary to you guys, and rightfully so.

Keep fear mongering though, people are waking up to these tactics and are getting tired of them.

We could do it. Hell....the administration gave nearly a trillion to the goddam banks then about 2010 the Fed circulated an additional $3 trillion through the banks. If we pay our debt with American dollars nobody in the world would question it. It admittedly would devalue the dollar some and cause some inflation but we could do it.

Yes, a huge chunk, the majority of people living off of entitlement programs vote democrat, that my friends is a fact, which is why the democrats will fight tooth and nail to prevent such programs from even being worked on to benefit the people who rely on them so much, god forbid people be able to get away from those programs and become productive citizens or something. Entitlements are pretty much the democrat plantation. And we all know what happens when the folks begin to leave the plantation.

All of the oil will be for all intensive purposes be gone in 200 years.

Nothing has been proven to replace that energy source now and in 200 years with at least a doubling of the worlds human population..more likely tripled or quadrupled there won't be enough energy to run ANY economy.

So it's really humorous to see all this angst about "numbers" that only call attention to a small aspect of what is out of control or what is uncontrollable under any concievable human ability to correct.

As I see it these are the lasts days of "summer" anyway and a very long and cold winter is approaching steadily..undeniably and unavoidably.

So as a previous poster said.. you might as well enjoy what time you have. "Numbers" Shmumbers! When the energy is gone the starving freezing inhabitants on this planet won't care a lick about who owes who what.

Tell your kids and your kids kids kids to start building really big sail boats with what materials are left and still accessable. Floatillas of big boats will be the only safe place with a food supply in about 300 years. Unless and untill about 90% of the land population starves or freezes to death life on land in 300 years will be very much like.. the world predicted in Mad Max and Thunderdome..

How do you see it? Steam powered farm machinery? What about aircraft? Gonna be tough to go any significant distances on WATTS.

Imagine what the world would have been like WITHOUT oil. Imagine it again. That WILL be our future whether you agree or dissagree or think the idea is just "entertaining".

So we are supposed to be all boo hooey over the balance sheets that won't mean squat in the REAL future?

....Or, the fact those (same) people are ONLY concerned about expenses vs. income (in cluding the environment ), over the course o' their Life.... obviously.....while they whine & cry about "their grandchildren". What bullshit !!

 

 
As I see it these are the lasts days of "summer" anyway and a very long and cold winter is approaching steadily..undeniably and unavoidably.

So as a previous poster said.. you might as well enjoy what time you have. "Numbers" Shmumbers! When the energy is gone the starving freezing inhabitants on this planet won't care a lick about who owes who what.

Tell your kids and your kids kids kids to start building really big sail boats with what materials are left and still accessable. Floatillas of big boats will be the only safe place with a food supply in about 300 years.

Forget the current politicians for a minute. And forget Paul and his son too (since this thread will just turn into a fight).

Do you see anyone on the horizon that could potentially lead us out of our financial mess? I understand that it would have to be a joint effort by Congress and the Presidency but wanted to know if there was anyone out there that even has a chance of saving us from the massive debt that hangs around all of our necks. Do you see anyone that is fiscally responsible?

 

We do not have a all that much of financial mess. Our debt problems are exaggerated by Republicans so they can use it as a pretext for dismantling the welfare state.

Our debt is not that big, we will grow out if it like we did after WWII. But we need to increase taxes on the rich so we can pay for things like social security.

Yes...it is that simple. Now that one of Bush's wars is finished and the other is beginning to dwindle we can get a handle on it. The goddam chicken hawk Republicans should have to see their own go 10,000 miles to some shithole in the sand when they conjure up these boldfaced lies about WMD's and non existent threats. Our military is ten times stronger than all the others combined and the Republicans develop erectile dysfunction at the thought of cutting the military budget. Dwight Eisenhower of their own party warned them about developing a military industrial complex and they proceeded to do it anyway.
 
 
The automatic spending cuts kick in Jan. of 2013.

The Bush tax cuts expire in Dec. of 2012.

Spending cuts + expiring tax cuts = deficit reduction.

Pretty simple really.

I know Romney's career has been cutting waste from budgets and turning things around. He's done that with every job.

Unfortunately, he isn't a pure conservative.

Newt and Santorum participated in slowing the budget in the 90s.

Same issues.

We all know Obama won't.

I would argue that higher probability for the GOP candidates to do it.

It's much better for us to spend non-existant trillions of dollars and inflate our currency to the point where our money is worthless?

I'm not saying never pay it off. I'm just saying, right now, interest rates are at historic lows. We should take advantage of being able to borrow cheaply and put that money to work building up the country. Once the economy is humming along nicely, then we raise taxes and cut spending and balance the budget.
 
 
Eliminate the foreign aid and entitlements,and bullshit green wasre failures abd were getting sonewhere just because people voted the leaders and them deciding doesnt creare direct represenration of the peopkes interests. Citizens should have DIRECT AUTHORITY overr any budget matters,and nothing should be done for foreign interests.
 
 
 
 
 
What they should do is print enough money to pay it. Then they should rework the IRS system of taxation taking out all the loopholes that rich people and corporations use to avoid taxation. Then a strict "balanced budget" amendment should be added to the constitution which absolutely makes it impossible to go in debt. Don't hold your breath.

 

How stupid are you, anyway? Print enough money? Name one fucking country in the history of the world that's been able to pull that off, and I'll personally kiss your ass.

Google the Wiemar Republic and hyper-inflation, jackass!

 

We could do it. Hell....the administration gave nearly a trillion to the goddam banks then about 2010 the Fed circulated an additional $3 trillion through the banks. If we pay our debt with American dollars nobody in the world would question it. It admittedly would devalue the dollar some and cause some inflation but we could do it.

 

You have no understanding of economics if you that would be a plausible way to take care of our debt. The fact is that our money would not inflate a 'little bit' as you suggested but would be essentially worthless. The people that we borrowed that money from expect to get paid back. What do you think they will say when we try and hand them a hundred dollar bill that no longer had the purchase capacity of an apple. That would be the last time we ever got something in good faith. Sure - we could do it but it amounts to nuking our economy and making the Great Depression look like an economic boom.

 
Who, in the future, is gonna reduce our national debt?

In who's future?

Next generation.. ? Ten generations? Ten million generations?

All of the oil will be for all intensive purposes be gone in 200 years.

Nothing has been proven to replace that energy source now and in 200 years with at least a doubling of the worlds human population..more likely tripled or quadrupled there won't be enough energy to run ANY economy.

No lie..we don't need another hero..

 Mad Max" We don't Need Another Hero" Tina Turner - YouTube 

 

Grumble - you should know better. This is clearly bullshit. First, we do not have 200 years left - it is likely less since prediction in use never even come close but in the end it matters not: we will have moved on long before that. 200 years may sound like something that is reachable until you realize how long we actually have been using oil on a mass scale for energy. It has not been close to that and technology moves at a blistering pace - always going faster as it improves. We are going to find alternative energies, that is a given. We are deep in that process now. All we really need is to get the politics out of the way and let the scientists innovate and create that energy in a way that is reliable and cheap. It is coming and it will be here FAR faster than 200 years.

The problem is that we have PROVEN that we will not balance the budget after the economy gets better.

It really boils down to one thing - everyone in this day and age is all about getting the budget balanced using someone else to do it. You see it every day across party lines. The left screams tax the rich - I am not rich. The right screams reduce the entitlements - until you talk to the elderly conservatives. The bigotry is insane. Each year, we become more and more dependent on the government and as long as that continues, we will never see any reductions at all. Any reduction is always going to cut into that program that someone uses and then that same someone is going to say 'but not that program, I LIKE that one' and nothing will get done as nothing has been done in the past. It is pathetic. We need real change and real change does not come from the government. It needs to come from us through our culture and our worldviews. As long as we keep doing what we do then we are going to keep voting for the same people to do the same things to us over and over and over....
 
 
 
I feel a little defeated. I have resisted the urge as long as possible, but i finally have someone on my ignore list. It's Mr. Shaman. Most of the people who are stupid enough to deserve to be ignored, provide me some entertainment value. Mr. Shaman is just annoying, his stupidity never entertains me it just makes me feel pity for him.

For example, he just called me a Gingrich supporter, even though I've never said one good word about the man and have repeatedly said bad things about him.

 

You know, I am not sure why I have not put him on ignore as well. TBH, I have no one on ignore but his posts are the only ones that I consistently do not read. Can't remember the last time I actually read one of his incoherent musings....

LOL....you think Greece has some revolt going on...cut the entitlements.

As far as foreign aid....it don't amount to shit...about $40 billion a year. The annual interest on the debt which must be paid or we go into default is over $500 billion a year. The debt became unmanageable after Reagan and the Bushes cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans then began to borrow from foreign banks to cover the shortfall. They've never cut a dime of spending.

I have a scheme for stopping war. It's this - no nation is allowed to enter a war till they have paid for the last one. ~Will Rogers

That would certainly help reduce the debt, now and in the future.

As for reducing the debt - and fixing what's wrong with Congress

Warren Buffett recommended passing a law that says anytime there is a deficit of more than 3% of GDP, all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for re-election.

Some political thoughts from political thinkers about National Debt -

Debt is the fatal disease of republics, the first thing and the mightiest to undermine governments and corrupt the people. ~Wendell Phillips

Blessed are the young, for they shall inherit the national debt. ~Herbert Hoover

Nothing is so well calculated to produce a death-like torpor in the country as an extended system of taxation and a great national debt. ~WILLIAM COBBETT, letter, Feb. 10, 1804

The debt isn't the problem.

The GDP and taxation are.

No Republican candidate has any plan remotely suited to dealing with the problems we're facing right now.

Most of their platforms would actually make this economy much worse.

I can't tell whether they hate America and Ameircans or they're just flat out stupid.

Doesn't really matter, I guess, since either way they're not interested in changing their POVs.

Where does your and Chris's confidence in cutting spending come from? When was the last time a budget was less than the year before?

Has Obama ever in his political career at any level, reduced an overall budget?

NO! But that was rather the point. I think it was Paul Ryan that stated it best:
" Ive got a better idea. Lets pass a bill to cover the moon with yogurt that will cost $5 trillion today. and then lets pass a bill the next day to cancel that bill. We could save $5 trillion. Wait, Ive got a better idea. Our debt is $14 trillion. Lets come up with a new plan to spend $14 trillion, then rescind it the next day and lets save $14 trillion. This stuff is fiscal fantasy. You cant make this stuff up, Mr. Speaker."

That is what this asinine government continues to call 'cuts.' Instead of cutting, they increase the spending less. That is fucking asinine.

You're right, I'm just trying to inject a little reality into the Obama worshippers. They can watch their god skyrocket spending every year, then blindly assume (after he's re-elected of course) that he'll just make huge cuts in spending contrary to everything he's done his entire political career.

I don't think the potion i have is strong enough though.

We never paid off the huge debt accumulated during WWII (war bonds, 100% of GDP). Instead, we kept borrowing more and more.

But the world did not end back then, did it?

That is how the US government was dealing with its debt since 1789 -- it was paying one credit card with another. Works like a charm -- because unlike the mere mortals, the government will never retire and it can count on an ever growing tax revenues.

15+ TRILLION is indeed big if compared it with your welfare check. But it is more than reasonable if you compare it with US GDP.
 
 
The basic premise of your question is presumptive.

It presumes that the problem of our economy is based on natiuonal debt.

Now think about that.

It doesn't make sense.

We've had a large national debt our entire lives.

So clearly something other than that debt is causing our economic woes.
 
 
.

The public has a short memory. Look back, Google a bit. Whichever party has the most power (such as the White House and one chamber of Congress) will tell you that debt and deficits are not that important. Dick Cheney said it when the GOP was spending like a 16 year old girl with a Gold Card.

Look, gang, there are only three pieces to this puzzle: It's politically impossible to give millions of people something for nothing and then take it away. You immediately become The Bad Guy and get voted out. It's politically difficult to tax the producers to pay for this, because they have the influence to get you out of office. It's relatively easy to hide all the spending by just issuing bonds. Taking loans against the future to pay for all this.

Until we install term limits AND get money out of politics, nothing is going to change. If you disagree, outline for me how that statement is wrong.

Yea, well, so what? You might think that losing all those good paying manuf. jobs had an impact.
Or the collapse of the housing industry and all that lost equity. Or the fact that to many people pulled their meager retirement savings out of the market at the worst time and now have nothing.
Or that health insurance and energy and food have become more and more expensive.

Naw, none of the things above have had an impact. It it just the debt. so sayeth the Repubs.

Actually, a plutocracy that was benevolent might not be to bad.

But seriously, the dumbing down of Americans makes it highly unlikely that our form of guvmint is going to change. Doing things like making corporations equal to individual citizens is guaranteed to keep the status quo in power. We can't even get over 50% of elegible voters to vote. Apathy runs rampant.
The people of KY keep on rel eecting Mitch the Turtle McConnell. What does that tell you? That poor people of KY don't know what the fuck they are doing and that the rich of KY know that and keep on getting McConnell re elected. Plutocracy at work.
