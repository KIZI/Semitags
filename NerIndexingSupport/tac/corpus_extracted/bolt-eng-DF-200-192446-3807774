R. D. Blackmore I think...oh and one of my (non blood) relatives killed someone and got in the paper for it.
 
 
My cousins are decendants of a Greek pirate and an Egyptian princess. There's a statue of the happy couple in Athens.
 
 
My great-great-great grandad was the captain of the titanics best friend. He was the one who said 'go faster' thus killing most of them. Basicaly its his fault the titanic sunk. He then dressed up as a woman to get off faster.

I went to church with him! Uncle Billy/Mr Liddel was ace. His sister (Auntie Rena) used to do the Sunday School and then after church (when I was little) he used to play penalties on the side of the church wall with the kids   Half my family went to his funeral, along with half of Liverpool. Everyone loved him.
 
 
Not me personally but my friend is related to Laslo Rajk (she even has the same last name).
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajk

That's so morbid, but the first one I have heard of.

I'm descended from Thomas Paine, and according to Wikipedia...

Thomas Paine's words were quoted by President Barack Obama in his inaugural address: "Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it."

I did not know that.

That's so cool!  

Elizabeth Fry is like my great great great great Aunt or something (no idea how many greats) on my maternal grandfathers side.

And my maternal grandmothers side has been traced back to the Youngs of Ireland (royal family).

On my dad's side the most notable person, that we know of, is a Turkish highwayman. It's quite the story.

My friend is 2nd cousins with Jeremy Clarkson.

My auntie was once on S4C talking about ducks.
My dad was on a documentary about skydiving on...

S4C
 
but no one famous
 
 
my uncle is steve harper, the newcastle united goalkeeper  
 
 
Hardly "famous," especially in a modern sense, but i;m a direct descendent (possible to be proved by getting the old family tree out, which is literally a hundred pages in total, length and breadth,) of Sir John Rossington.

Apparently, he chased a hare into a church, which turned into a beautiful maiden, resulting in him turning into stone where he stood.

"The most ancient monument in the church is the stone effigy of a cross-legged knight, holding a heart in his clasped hands and girt with a cross-hilted sword. It is now placed on a substantial stone base against the north wall of the chancel, and is supposed to represent Sir John Rossington, of Rossington, near Doncaster."

How many of your relatives haves statues over 500 years old :P

Oo cool I never know if I actually ever met him.   might of done when I was a baby or something like that.....
but if he was up North in liverpool or whatever probably not unless he came down to visit family down here, but most of my mums is based is scotland so hmmm....
Have to ask my mum next time i'm home he was on her side of the family.
 
 
MY dad used to be best friends with Chris Tarrant. LOL
 
 
I'm descended from Catherine Parr. Apart from that, nobody particularly famous in modern times.
 
 
My grandad helped build Titanic (nice work, gramps), a distant relation was among those executed after the Easter Rising (sure that was a fine plan, lads) and my cousin's dad was killed on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry (she told you not to go). Funny how the two halves of my family have been killing each other for generations. I feel that none of these reflect too great on me, but meh, the last couple of generations have been peaceful types with nothing but disadin for that past, and a desire to distance ourselves from it as much as possible.
 
 
My surname is King, so I guess if you go back far enough........
 
 
My dad was on the 4-man Blue Nile expedition in 1972. According to a book called 'Quest for Adventure' he shot a crocodile in the head.
 http://www.paddlermagazine.com/issue...icle_111.shtml 

Not particularly interesting unless you're into canoeing. Or shooting things in the head.
 
 
Erm.. someone in my family is married to Mahatma Gandhi's (great great ?...) grandson...

and my grandad worked with Lenny Henrys uncle and dad for years in a factory in the Midlands somewhere i think.
 
 
I am related (somewhat distantly!) to an ex Arsenal FC manager, Tom Whittaker, who won the league a couple of times, and FA cup.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Whittaker_(footballer  )
Being an Arsenal supporter, its nice to bring this up occasionally!
 
 
Lol. My Great Uncle or someone invented the collapsable traffic cone, and now is a millionaire raving it up in Scotland somewhere.
 
 
Well he wasn't really famous, but my great great grandad was the Lord Mayor of Nottingham. He has a school named after him.
 
 
yes, but not for particularily good reasons =O
 
 
According to my mother and the rest of her family, I have a great great grandfather (don't know how many 'greats' to put in) who is the oldest person to have ever been alive in New Zealand and he lived to like 132 or something.  

However, I don't really know if I believe them. It sounds like the type of story that's been exaggerated and twisted to make it sound better than it is. And it still isn't particularly interesting.  
 
 
I live next door to Rick Astley's brother.

Ye that's right, I'm mixing with the A-listers.

I'm told that my uncle once played for nottingham forest (but I've never met him so i'm doubtful)

And my cousin was goin to be in harry potter but couldn't because it clashed with his A levels (now he's just in an energy saving advert   )
 
 
My Godfather's brother plays in The Filthy Dukes
 
 
my grandmother used to be friends with patrick stewart

I don't know the whole story, but it would be awesome if captain picard himself banged my granny
 
 
Not really famous, but one of my ancestors was a conquistador...a Captain in Francisco Pizarro's Spanish conquest of Peru. He is written about in a book called The Conquest of the Incas, and it says his force defeated and captured the Inca Captain Titu Yupanqui. Quite interesting I suppose.
 
 
My Great-Grandmother's adopted son is Michael Fish, the BBC weatherman who predicted in 1987 that there wouldn't be a hurricane. Fun times

And my great uncle invented radar for submarines
 
 
This is my cousin:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Heath 

He is *apparently* a famous magazine editor and had a baby with Sharleen Spiteri from Texas. Never met him though, but it's on the family tree! lol
 
 
I don't...my cousins a philosopher and I think one of them somewhere is a famous writer.

I do however go to uni with a boy who's sisters an A lister, a girl who's a classical singing star and another who's a model/actress.

I also know a few ambassadors to the UN's kids and various random semi-famous musicians/actors.

My uncle is an MD at the  Willis Group , the company which uses the  Willis building  in London.

Thats all I can think of, so nobody major famous really... Apparently I'm related to one of the kings of wales though lol
 
 
My Grandma, one of my aunts and one of my uncles are all published authors of novels
 
 
My Grandads uncle (so my great great uncle?) was married to the voice of 'Weed' from Bill and Ben the Flowerpot men.
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcF9JSxkUSE 

I met her at a garden party and everyone kept asking her to go 'weed, weeeeed'. I think she got a bit annoyed.

Also my Dad was the director of the company who was in charge of building the London Eye and the IMAX cinema.

My family is a pretty famous local family (or were in older times).. not much relevance to the mass of TSR though! If you come from Sevenoaks maybe...
 
 
My bro is in a programme which is always repeated on some holiday channel, called 'Newquay', talking about surfing  
And he's just been shortlisted with his fionce for the next series of 'the restaurant' on channel four.

And his best childhood friend was the drummer in that band Rooster, lolz.

Damn it I wish I had even slightly famous friends...
 
 
My grandad was a wrestler...in Egypt.
 
 
my uncle dave is friends with richard hammond.

For some unknown reason, I find that programme extremely fascinating. I haven't watched this week's (I'll do so on iPlayer later) but I very much dislike those Jordan and Duncan fellows - they're so up themselves.
 
 
i am an a-lister myself
 
 
The author Simon Scarrow dedicated a book to my uncle (who also got on the news due to dying tragically).
My great-grandfather was chief librarian for York city and there's a plaque somewhere (not exciting I know).
My ancestors were french aristocrats who came to England to avoid the guillotine during the french revolution, and apparently the Duke of Hampshire is a distant cousin.

My great great grandfather (think that's the right amount of 'greats') invented a 'gold ring' or something which made televisions possible but his son gambled the bloody patent away.

Two of my uncles beat the Krays in a fight and made them leave Birmingham when they were really young.

Hmmmm.

I also saw Ulrika Jonsson once.
 
 
Not related, but my mum went to college with Stephen Fry. I've heard lots of stories.

She also taught in a primary school in Chingford that David Beckham went to. Not his class, unfortunately.

Yeah, one of my very, very distant cousins is Kim Cattrall. Never met her, before you ask, but she is on my family tree. It's really distant though. I also had a closer relative (my Dad's cousin) who played hocky in the 1984 English olympic team.
 
 
I'm sort of related to David Tennant in a non-blood way  
My uncle's sister's nephew. Where my Uncle is married to my mum's sister  
 
 
I have had a lot of "possibles" my brother was almost on Big Brother a few years ago but couldnt be arsed with it and gave up before the final round of selections, and a few years before was offered a few record deals and to be a backing dancer but has always been a "drop out" and lives for the moment. He was also picked out of an audience when visiting MTV about 10 years ago(back when it was good) and sang a song on air.

My dad runs a charity out of his benefits and has met loads of celebs and been on tv loads of times but normally in news reports and the odd part of a documentary but hard to find stuff on(plus not giving who I am away)

That's cooler than mine. I don't even watch Sex and the City.
 
 
well not related to me as such but one of my bro's best friends uncles is jason isaacs and one of my friends' great great grandfather was h.g. wells.
 
 
my uncle was in the m people, and my dad inexplicably had a main part in a (welsh (boohoo)) bafta nominated film this year.
 
 
My step-dad used to play in the Lilac Time with Stephen Duffy (before they got even vaguely famous, though)...he was their live bassist.
AND he went to school with Stephen Fry.

And my maternal grandad did something important for building societies, although I can never remember what.

My friend's cousin is Desmond from Lost

My uncle is the  British ambassador to Thailand.  That's a fun job right now.
 
 
One of my ancestors was Saint Margaret of Scotland (who was also a Queen, so I'm related to the ancient Scottish kings - through illegitimacy though, unfortunately.)

The Hakim family are hugely influential in Iraq. Too influential, some might say.

My cousin's in-laws are best friends with Freddy Mercury's parents...and that's the closest I'll ever get to fame!

Yeh, I would be uncomfortable with a name like that too. Not so much the getting blown up aspect of it all, more the connotations of being part of a big Ayatollah family.

Luckily, my name is the 'John Smith' of the Arabic world.
 
 
my dad is tupac shakur.

Why? What connotations are you referring to?

Haha, the John Smith of the Arab world! That's how common my dad's name is!

My mum's dad was trouble at the time being a) Shia b) a Communist. She didn't see or hear from her dad for 9 years as he had to escape the borders to Syria. Pretty much the standard Iraqi sob story to be fair but the details did move me nevertheless.
 
 
My cousin is the author of the book Roots and the biography of Malcolm X, Alex Haley. That's all I know concerning famous relatives, because its rather difficult to trace my family lineage due to slavery and the lack of written documentation concerning the family pre-1865. I think once I get into college I'll do more genealogical research.

Like you wouldn't want to hear some guy say "raah bruv, was that the Grand Ayatollah's daughter grinding up against that guy last night?"

But actually it's just every day things, having Mohammed as a first name, makes me feel guilty being pulled up by the police for speeding. It's an obviouly Muslim name and you feel you should be setting a good example.

Doesn't matter if you are religious or not, your behaviour becomes associated with the religion and other Muslims.

Ouch, that's pretty harsh. We have had some really close calls too. We are Shia as well, but not Commis - more associated with Sadr and the Da'wa party. My uncle used to be in an underground group that distributed anti-Ba'athist propaganda. He had a narrow escape when a colleague of his at the hospital he worked at tipped him off about the intelligence services coming to pick him up that day. He left the country immediately. Most of the others in the group were killed.

My dad spent 3 months in Abu Ghraib getting tortured in his place, but managed to get out alive, luckily.

My dad's ex-brother-in-law is the leader of a large cult. I think he lives in Australia now, but he used to be a window cleaner. According to his website, his cult is international. So not really a relative of mine, but he keeps trying to recruit my half-brother and half-sister into his cult, apparently.

 This is him . He's not famous enough to have a wikipedia entry, which I think must be something of an ego-killer for a cult leader in this day and age,
 
 
i share an island with a beegee
 
 
Nope none

I would wreck that chick.

My dads cousins step brother was/is married to Mel C, but then again, you said famous people.
 
 
Napoleon Buonaparte?

Great,great, great...(boring) granddaddy.

You can choose your friends, but you can't choose your family.

I've got some really neat friends and they're far more important.
 
 
William the Conqueror.

My granny has a family tree somewhere at home and he's at the very top of it. Let's face it though, he got around so much that half of England is probably descended from him...

Oh, and my great great great great great (you get the idea) grandfather was Elizabeth I's advisor. My family goes downhill from there on...
 
 
I really have a very boring family.

My great uncle worked on our family tree and apparently discovered that we were very distantly related to the Kennedy family.

My aunt went out with one of the "other" guys from The Jam for a while.

Oh, and my friend is a non-blood relative of Malcolm Young from AC/DC. When she saw them at the O2 last week she sat next to his daughter and then had tickets to the aftershow.
 
 
One of my uncles is an Australian rugby league coach, he won an NRL Grand Final in 2003 with Penrith Panthers.
 
 
My husbands godfathers grandad encouraged Thomas Hardy to write his novels. Said godfathers aunt and uncle were also the very last people to see T.E. Lawrence, aka Lawrence of Arabia alive before his motorbike crashed killing him in the process. They ran the little grocery shop he visited just before his accident. I myself am a desendent of King Brian Boru of Ireland....think hes buried in Dublin, not sure. Which ( according to Wiki) means I am also related to JFK, John Kerry and the current Vice President Joe Biden!.
 
 
I'm faintly related to Steven Gerrard.

edit: oh, and two of my cousins were in Chicago Town pizza adverts.  
 
 
my great great great great great uncle was Captain james Wolfe who 'conquered' Quebec for England and died in battle out there. He is buried in Westminster Cathedral. And I have a bunch of famous friends. My friend had dinner with the last three presidents of the united states and bill clinton bought her a Pizza. Also my step-uncle (?) was Tony Blair's personal speech writer.
 
 
My ex boyfriend has a 50% chance of having Hitler as his grandad.

He's going to get a test done when he's older, only he is a bit concerned he'll either be hunted down by Jews or end up with a neo-nazi following.

True stuff, as well!
 
 
Oh and Pete Townsend (the Who guitarist) is a close family friend, godfather of my cousin. We call him Uncle Pete  

My auntie is also a Princess, and their family own the smallest island in the world haha.

I've also elbowed Zara Phillips in the stomach, who is the Queen's granddaughter, but that's another story...

I have friends with famous relatives though - my mates dad is the wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin, and my other mates brother is James Bourne from Busted. I was mates(ish) with a guy at school who was signed by Honda last year at the age of 16 and is on his way to F1 (Will Stevens). My cousins are also relatively famous - one is an actor, the other a golfer, not noticeable enough for mention though!

And my great great great (something like that) grandad was a "Sir" and the first man to ever drive a train round the Himalayas.

Well, someone had to do it I suppose...
 
 
My Aunty is Shakira's mum's cousin.
 
 
My uncle was a royal pilot for king Hussein, the now deceased king of Jordan.
 
 
i'm very, very distantly related to Andrew Murray.

My mum's great uncle (so my great great uncle?) helped to invent the atomic bomb!!  

My ancestor was a minister of a Methodist church in scotland, who was one of the first settlors in South Africa. He set up a version of the Methodist church in South Africa which many years later, promoted the ideas of apartheid which were then adopted by the governement, who were members of this church!  

My great great grandmother was the first woman in South Africa to go to university

My dad taught Sean Connery's son and got a lift from him in his Aston Martin, which was one of the ones he got free or something while he ws being James Bond. My dad's got some letters from him too. My dad also taught Nelson Mandela's son in South Africa.
 
 
I wouldn't say famous, but my cousin's wife is the personal fitness trainer of Keira Knightley and my cousin is the persoonal fitness trainer of Jim Sturgess amongst other high profile business people. He was apparently offered Â£500k to travel with this guy for about a year and work with him on fitness related stuff.
 
 
No, I self am famous enough  
 
 
One distant relative is the painter Louis B. Hurt. He has work in the National Gallery. Also I'm related to George Elliot the writer. I'm guessing most people will be related to someone famous, as everyone will have 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great grandparents, and so on. Therefore If you include lots of generations, and uncles aunts and cousins, then you are quite likely to a famous relative.

My dad claimed when he was doing all our family tree stuff that we're related to Macbeth... but I don't know whether to believe him.

He also found out that my like great great great grandfather got deported to Canada because he stole horses.

I have lots of friends who are related to famous people but my family is a little laaaame.

Ooh ooh I remember, my mum taught the someone from the Beetles daughter Ballet I think... Something like that.
And my dad went to school with Blur

well my grandad played for tottenham and was a sub for the england team   Denis Hunt

Also my sister in laws cousin is lead singer of band raging speed horns.  
 
 
Your relative only classifies as famous or well-known if they have a wikipedia page dedicated to them.

My two grandfathers played on the Scottish Basketball team lol. One of them also invented cruciform stitch, and the other has a 3 stars, a comet and a dinosaur named after him and helped discover Mad Cow's Disease

They don't have wikipedia pages though  
 
 
'Faintly' famous... My grandad used to be a footballer, he played for Bournemouth & Bristol Rovers. He's a good friend of Tony Pulis though, who now manages Stoke, and my grandad is his kids' godfather.

I have never seen my family tree though, I may have other 'famous' relations, haha...
 
 
ha Yeah.. lol
 
 
My dad punched the author Colin Bateman in the face. Not exactly famous but quite funny
 
 
I'm a wizard.
 
 
Nope.

I just have a great aunt who was a nurse-
"Matron-in-Chief of Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service (QARNNS) for three years during the Second World War. In the King's birthday honours list 1944 she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, a first in the Royal Naval Nursing Service."
 
 
My great granddad was a primary suspect for The Great Train Robbery. He also appeared in numerous shows and national newspapers for "quirks" such as putting false teeth into his walls...
 
 
My uncle is the New Zealand cricket coach
 
 
My grandpas sister married J.R.R Tolkeins brother, so I'm kinda-ish related  
 
 
The only claim to fame I have, is that my great (x 5) grandfather was a famous-ish writer.

Oh and my mother dated Sean Connery's son lol..
 
 
Im Andrew Sach's Granddaughter  
 
 
My..great-grandmother's cousin invented the cataract eye operation - although that's not really famous.
 
 
I used to live down the same road as steve gibson's mum.
 
 
 
Nope, not that I know of unfortunately

I did not know that.

 

Wow - you're descended from a genius! I like Thomas Paine.
 
 
A distant cousin of mine is one of Sean Bean's ex-wives... and I know someone who was in the first harry potter.... he's only on screen for about ten seconds, but it doesn't stop us all insisting on pausing it and pointing whenever he comes on!

Omg JEALOUS! Peter Capaldi is awesome. The Thick of It ftw  

I'm related to George Stephenson, in some distant great-uncle kind of way.

Apparently, I'm aslo distantly related to this man:

Haha! That's true but I don't feel that it applies here (eyes watching your every move) as much as it would back in Iraq, where to be fair I can't imagine any girl grinding up against a guy, well at least not in public anyway. And it's especially not the case where I live.... a small derelict Welsh village in the back of beyond, with not a single Muslim in sight.

So did you live in Iraq previously yourself? I have never lived there (bar the first 4 months of my existence). Looks like your uncle had a lucky escape, is he still out of the country now? And that's terrible about your dad....was he involved with anti Ba'athist activities too? Iraqi stories are always so heart wrenching and depressing right?!
 
 
I am related to Neville Chamberlain, the ex-Prime Minister  
 
 
My great-grandfather and great-great-great (I think) were famous musicians in their day, they were chief violinist and chief harpist to George V/VI and Queen Victoria respectively. My great-great-great(?) grandfather playing for Queen Victoria caused a bit of a scandal because he was a Romany Gypsy. Unfortunately, I lack any musical ability, having failed my grade 2 exam. To quote my clarinet tutor I'm 'not really a grades person'...
 
 
Hahaha whilst reading all this...a freekin bird hit my bedroom window!! Funny...Haaha...

I'm taking this a tad too far now, but my sister is in the same year of uni as Charlotte McCormack, the dancer girl Simon Cowell praised to high heaven for her looks. :P
 
 
My father's cousin 'Selcuk Dereli' is currently a referee in Turkey and UEFA.

I get mad when people swear at him during the football match   I don't usually tell anyone that we are related, and once my ex boyfriend sweared at him while we were having a confersation, i told him not to (of course he didn't know who he was) but he carried on, i said right! it's finished between us! how can you swear at my family! He was of course shocked   But i was looking for an excuse to get rid of him anyway, so this was it

Thomas Paine as in the 18th/19th century writer?

From my point of view (after I read The Age of Reason), yes, he does!

My uncle works for the Library of Congress and wrote a report (in around 1999) predicting that Al Qaeda would fly a plane into the pentagon. That got a bit of media attention after 9/11...

I am related to Mickey Marcus, the famous Israeli war general who had a film made about him (He Casts a Giant Shadow).

Wendy Shalit is my mother's cousin. She's semi-famous for writing books and articles protesting pre-marital sex. (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Shalit  ) Her sister is also semi-famous for plagiarism in journalism.

I am related to Eli Broad (through marriage, not blood) who is the 93rd richest person in the world, apparently. Unfortunately we've never met, but he did go to my cousin's Bat Mitvah and gave her a bit of cash.

My grandmother was the mayor of a small town and wrote a couple books. Several members of my family have written books, actually.

Oh... I don't think going to school with a famous person makes you in any remotely way famous, by the way.
 
 
my mates mum mates son plays for man u. shut up all of you, there is no way so many people have famous relatives.

Related (rather strongly) to the Rothschilds. Probably one of the most known 'relatives' I have would be Ralph Fiennes.
 
 
Both my birth parents were in the Hells Angels motorbike gang....suffice to say one of them died and the other is locked up

My next door neighbour who was a close friend in secondary school did a programme with dawn french a few years ago, but he has moved to london now

I was working at a bar in bristol when the x factor tour finalists performed every week, and so I got to meet all of them and have pics and stuff, but thats hardly being related haha.
 
 
Ben Franklin   says my Grandma anyway..

My mums cousin dated a famous male dancer he has been on strictly come dancing want the name pm me

My dads fiancÃ© used to babysit the least singer of the pulp and still speaks to him. Now
 
 
According to my dad, one of my ancestors built the Cutty Sark. Pretty sure that's bull**** though.
 
 
My second cousin was on Ladette to Lady on ITV!
 
 
According to the family tree, I am related to William the Conqueror..
 
 
My cousin had been in a relationship with Karen Gillan (Amy Pond- doctor who's assistant) for the last few years! I am also related to Austrian royalty somehow... it's something like Franz I had an affair with one of the ladies, and she had a son (my great great grandad).
 
 
My uncle is the head of engineering at Glasgow University.
 
 
The number of people who have answered this thread with things such as "my third cousin's boyfriend's mum's dad's uncle's chipmunk once sat on the shoulder of Henry III" made me laugh.

My great uncle is a welsh opera singer, and my great grandad was a lancashire poet. A lot of his poems were put to music and sung in the trenches in WW1. Not much to some people, but to know that a relative of mine helped to raise the moral of soldiers fighting for their country really warms my heart.

EDIT: This thread is about relatives. There is another thread about famous people you've met! Just because you saw them buying a melon in the Co-Op once, many moons ago, does not mean that you're related- however tantalisingly tasty the melon looked!

According to the very extensive family tree, I have a few famous relatives in my family:

-Distantly related to Jane Austen
-Directly descended from Edward III
-7th cousins to Abraham Lincoln
-my great-great uncle was the Mayor of Chesterfield (Sir Charles Shentall)
-King Henry VIII is my great-great-great...uncle
-My uncle is the well known children's author Rob Childs (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Childs  )
 
 
Apparently a decendant of mine was Saint Margaret of Scotland, a queen in the 12th or 13th century.
 
 
The problem with claiming to be descended from figures such as William the Conqueror, Caesar, Muhammad, Charlemagne, Genghis Khan and so on is the amount of time involved and how many descendants they would have over such long a time. I'd argue that such figures would be related to everyone of that ethnicity or in those modern regions, and possibly even wider beyond that.

See below for a rough estimate of how many ancestors you'd have 1000 years ago. I realise that 4 generations per century is a very rough estimate given changing birth rates and so on, but it can't be far off.
See here

Generation = Number of ancestors in that generation (estimated year)
1 = 2 (c. 2000 AD)
2 = 4
3 = 8
4 = 16 (c.1900 AD)
5 = 32
6 = 64
7 = 128
8 = 256 (c.1800 AD)
9 = 512
10 = 1,024
11 = 2,048
12 = 4,096 (c.1700 AD)
13 = 8,192
14 = 16,384
15 = 32,768
16 = 65,536 (c.1600 AD)
17 = 131,072
18 = 262,144
19 = 524,288
20 = 1,048,576 (c.1500 AD)
21 = 2,097,152
22 = 4,194,304
23 = 8,388,608
24 = 16,777,216 (c.1400 AD)
25 = 33,554,432
26 = 67,108,864
27 = 134,217,728
28 = 268,435,456 (c.1300 AD)
29 = 536,870,912
30 = 1,073,741,824
31 = 2,147,483,648
32 = 4,294,967,296 (c.1200 AD)
33 = 8,589,934,592
34 = 17,179,869,180
35 = 34,359,738,370
36 = 68,719,476,740 (c.1100 AD)
37 = 137,438,593,500
38 = 274,879,906,900
39 = 549,755,813,900
40 = 1,099,511,628,000 (c.1000 AD)

Yep, that's a trillion ancestors living in 1000 AD. Given that the world population at the time wasn't even 1% of that, it seems likely that you're descended from the whole population a dozen times over. Your family tree would link to the same people coming up repeatedly. You're possibly descended from the majority of people in the world living at that time, but with a concentration on the geographical area of your ethnicity.
