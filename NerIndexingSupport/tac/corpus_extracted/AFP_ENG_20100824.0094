The number of North Sea oil spills soared in 2009/10, a British watchdog said on
Tuesday as it warned the energy sector to "up its game".

Independent regulator the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said the offshore
oil and gas industry had been warned about its safety record as new statistics
showed "unplanned hydrocarbon releases" up by more than a third year-on-year.

It comes as the industry faces heightened scrutiny worldwide in the wake of the
recent massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

"I am particularly disappointed, and concerned, that major and significant
hydrocarbon releases are up by more than a third on last year," Steve Walker,
head of HSE's offshore division, said in a statement.

"This is a key indicator of how well the offshore industry is managing its major
accident potential, and it really must up its game to identify and rectify the
root causes of such events."

The HSE said that hydrocarbon releases jumped by 42 percent in 2009/10 compared
with 2008/09.

The watchdog also reported a rise in major injuries suffered by workers in the
North Sea offshore energy sector.

There were 50 major injuries reported in 2009/10 -- up by 20 on 2008/09 and
higher than the average of 42 over the previous five years. No workers were
killed during activities regulated by HSE for a third year running.

"We will continue to take a tough line on companies who put their workers at
risk," said Walker.

"The challenge to improve safety will be ever greater as more offshore
installations exceed their original design life.

"Our new inspection initiative will check safety management plans to ensure
ageing is being taken into account, but the responsibility for getting safety
right in the first place rests where it always has -- with the duty holders."
