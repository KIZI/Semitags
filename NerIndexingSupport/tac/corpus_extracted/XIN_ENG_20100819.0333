Uganda's KCC FC has secured a technical boost as former Express SC assistant
coach Matia Lule joined the club as the head coach, local media reported on
Thursday.

Lule was unveiled to KCC players by the club chairman Bakka Musujja at the
Lugogo grounds earlier this week after signing a two-year contract for a monthly
salary of 1.5 million Ugandan shillings (about 680 U.S. dollars).

"I know the task is bigger and it requires everybody's support. Together with
players we shall achieve," Lule was quoted by the state-owned New Vision daily
as saying.

It is Lule's first job as a head coach though he had worked as assistant in
various clubs including Express last season.

"Joining KCC is the best thing because it was painful for me in Express SC. I
have always wanted to work with an institution and not individuals," added Lule.

However, Lule has an uphill task to revive KCC's fortunes as well as manage
players' discipline that failed his predecessors since George Best Nsimbe left.
