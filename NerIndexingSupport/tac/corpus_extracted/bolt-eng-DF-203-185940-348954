How much does it cost for you to register your vehicle(s) in your state?

Our vehicles are up for renewal this month. We would pay about $330 and $420 for each vehicle, but since we are in NH on military orders, we only have to pay about $40 each.
 
 
about 200 per vehicle (TX)
 
 
It completely depends on the value of the vehicle. Receiving numbers without detail won't mean a thing. States also differ.
My 6.5 yr old sedan was $90, while my H's newer sports car was almost $300.
 
 
$75 (Wisconsin)
 
 
Ours is based on the age of the car. My old civic costs $46.50/year, and the new car we just bought last year is something like $65 year.
 
 
$35 I think

True. I figured people would specify their state and other information if they wanted to share.
 
 
About $65
 
 
$80s and cars have been in the 15k range.
 
 
DH paid $180 for his truck back in December
The Honda will be about $120
and mine will be about $150
We live in CA
 
 
46.50/yr for DH's car.
I dont have to pay for mine until 2014 since I bought it new (I prepaid it)

(NJ)
 
 
$46.50/year/car (we have 3) in NJ.
EDIT: Actually on 2 of our cars we pay $10 more/year to have specialty plates, so $56.50 for those vehicles.
 
 
It depends on the vehicle model year (and possibly curb weight?). We have two newer cars and the regs are $260 and $325.
 
 
$65
 
 
Mine was $60ish to renew for 2 years. DH has to renew his truck every year but I can't remember what that cost.
 
 
In OH it depends in the weight (class) of the vehicle. Most autos are approx. $55.00
 
 
I am in Nebraska, and just paid $118 on my 03 minivan.
 
 
268 new 128 renewal
 
 
My registration was $75. TX
 
 
TX Two vehicles ~ $75 a piece. Just renewed this month.
 
 
$60-$100
 
 
In RI, the registration fee is mostly the same unless you have a vehicle that is over a certain weight. I think it is something like $40ish?
But we have a car tax, which is basically a property/excise tax that is paid to your city yearly for owning the vehicle. I paid $900 in 2011 for my 90K mile 6 year old subaru forester. The rate in my city for the car tax is something like $67 per $1000 of assessed value. The rate varies per town/city.
 
 
140 + 35-40 for biannual smog
the previous year i had paid almost 300
 
 
75 (truck) 85 (car..has a speciality tag) 45 (motorcycle) $60 for boat/trailer
ETA: Florida.. has nothing to do w/ year of the vehicle. Only the weight & speciality tags bump up the fee.
 
 
I think registration is $100 for 2 years, however, we also have an excise tax. Since we have two 2011 cars it is going be around $2,500. The excise amount will go down as the cars age.
 
 
There is a huge range depending on the vehicle/age. The 1996 Olds we just registered is $22 a year. My 2006 Escape is ~$230 a year. When DH had a truck above the standard curb weight it cost more than the Escape even though it was 4 years older and had close to the same blue book value.
 
 
I live in VA. I think registration is between $45 and $55. It's a small enough amount that I don't really think about it. We do have a property tax on vehicles based on the value of the car. For my 2011 Subaru Forrester valued at $25K, the tax will be roughly $600 this year.
 
 
$99 for 1 car. It's a flat amount per vehicle in IL
 
 
It used to be $36, but I think it went up a few dollars this year. I'm in PA.
 
 
PA
$36/ car
$80?something I think for our pickup truck.
 
 
In PA for a passenger vehicle, it's $36.
Commercial vehicles are more and those rates are determined by the Class the vehicle is in and their GVW.
 
 
Mine was $200 this year and MH's is $80.

Yeah in MA it's the excise tax that gets you. It's annual and dependent of type and year of your vehicle. The registration is $50 for a passenger car.
 
 
my car is a year old, it's $335 this year
DHs car is 4 years old, I'm guessing it will be about $150 based on last year being $180.
 
 
$36 each (PA)
 
 
$35 in PA
ETA Oops I guess it's $36 ;)
 
 
I had no idea that some states essentially roll the registration fee and excise tax into one fee. I was really confused when I started reading this post!
In CT, the reg fee and excise tax are separate. It's $80 to register any passenger vehicle with a regular plate (commercial and combination registrations go by vehicle weight). That's for a 2 year registration.
Once a year, we also get a bill from our town for the excise tax on the vehicle, which is a certain $ amount per $1000 of assessed value.
We don't pay either fee because we get military waivers.
 
 
When we moved here (to CA) we paid $300 for my car and $500 for DH's, due to taxes. Renewals will be about $90/year, I think.
 
 
$210 for a 2010 car. We are in CA.
 
 
80
 
 
$101 in FL, DH has a specialty plate since he is in the Coast Guard and I think it is $120.
 
 
approx. $130 + smog for my car
?? for DH's
We're in CA.
 
 
2008 Nissan Titan = $350
2011 Toyota Tundra = $550
We are in California
 
 
 
my car is a year old, it's $335 this year
DHs car is 4 years old, I'm guessing it will be about $150 based on last year being $180.

 

This kills me. My 94 Corolla was $110 last year. It's 18 freaking years old! It's gone up every year for the last few years. Granted, I have "designer" license plates, but I don't think they add that much more to the cost.
 
 
I m also in PA, so it's $36 per car.
 
 
On my old car (VW Beetle) it was almost $400 in Maryland.
New car - no clue as it was rolled into my payments.
ETA: That was registering it from a different state. I think it is $60ish every two years for registration...I can't remember.
I may be moving to VA and I gotta find out how much that will be....

$2500 a year is insane. And makes me feel so much better about the $500 per vehicle registration I pay.
 
 
I've paid anywhere from $25 to $600.
Right now, due to military, I have an out of state plate. It's $80 for 2 years for my HOR state. I pay $5 to the current state for a sticker that shows I passed inspection. H's car is only registered locally, and it's $25. If he weren't military it would be more like $400.
 
 
PA - $36. I have a large SUV.
When DH had a truck it was a little more, $50 something.
