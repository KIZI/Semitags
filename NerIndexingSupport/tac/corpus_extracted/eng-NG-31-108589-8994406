Dollars for Death

The American Dietetic Association (ADA) has 67,000
members. Their motto is "Everything in moderation."
That includes McDonald's, other fast food restaurants,
dairy products, NutraPoison, and sugar-rich soda. Of course,
the one concept that they do not limit is donations by
various industry groups who delight in seeing the
ADA's continuing "everything in moderation" policy.

The ADA receives millions of dollars in various forms
of funding from the milk industry. Their website
features the dairy industry's "three per day"
program. What whores these men and women of the
ADA are. Dollars for death should be their new motto.

One thing we cannot accept is bad health, even in
moderation. Advice from the ADA can collectively be
flushed down one giant toilet. We suggest that
you use Drano in moderation when sludge gets
stuck in your drain and the toilet backs up.

I cannot imagine that Ellen White could have
foreseen a herd of 67,000 ignoramuses marching
like German WWII stormtroopers with perfect
arcs in their alternate lateral arm swings and
perfectly straightened Rockette-like leg kicks
in sequence to the beat of a dyslexic drummer
when she wrote the following in her nineteenth
century Ministry of Healing:

"The narrow ideas of some would-be health
reformers have been a great injury to the
cause of hygiene. Hygienists should remember
that dietetic reform will be judged, to a great
degree, by the provision they make for their
tables; and instead of taking a course that
will bring discredit upon it, they should so
exemplify its principles as to commend them to
candid minds. They consult taste instead of
reason or the laws of health."

Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), wrote:

"What happens when nutrition meets money? Consider:
The American Dietetic Association (ADA) publishes
'Nutrition Fact Sheets' that defend fast foods,
the fake fat olestra, and starch-filled baby foods.
And it published a position paper that gave sugar
a clean bill of health. The ADA's fact sheets on
eating out, olestra, and baby foods acknowledge
that they were underwritten by McDonald's, Procter
& Gamble, and Gerber. And one of the co-authors of
its paper exonerating sugar was a scientific advisor
to the Canadian Sugar Institute."

I offer a solution in the form of a simple formula to
remedy the American Dietetic Association (ADA) virus.
This solution will be controversial, but it is for the
betterment of all Americans. The formula: Good health
equals Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands
filled with the membership of the ADA plus one weapon
of mass destruction. The air quality near exit 14-A off
the New Jersey Turnpike is so rich with dioxins and
other chemical pollutants that it can only get better as
a result of a detonation, while the cumulative health of
Americans will dramatically improve if that species of
creature known as dieticious-wretchedallus becomes extinct.

*Note: Construction crews are building a new football
stadium next to the old one, so there is no real
downside to the above formula.
