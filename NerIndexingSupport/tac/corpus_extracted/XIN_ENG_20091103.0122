Myanmar will join the World Travel Market show 2009 to be held in the United
Kingdom next week as its efforts to attract more world travelers to the country,
sources with the Myanmar Marketing Committee (MCC) said on Tuesday.

The four-day event in London from Nov. 9 to 12 will be attended by MMC and some
local travel agencies, the sources said.

In the world travel market show, the committee will distribute brochures, maps,
magazines and travel and tourism information about Myanmar, it said.

Meanwhile, the Union of Myanmar Travel Association (UMTA) and MMC also took part
in Travel Mart plus 2009-TTM 2009 in Bangkok, " Leisure 2009" in Russia and "ITB
Asia 2009" in Singapore in June, September and October respectively.

Myanmar's tourism business started to drop near the end of 2007 and continued in
2008 during which deadly cyclone Nargis hit the country. Moreover, the global
financial crisis, which sparked in late 2008, also affected Myanmar's tourism
sector.

The tourism authorities are working hard to promote the country 's international
tourism market for the revival of its tourism industry.

According to official statistics, tourist arrivals in Myanmar in 2008-09 fiscal
year ended in March totaled over 255,000.

The country targets tourist arrival of 1 million in the present 2009-10 fiscal
year which began in April.

Myanmar, rich with natural resources, beautiful environment and ancient cultural
heritage, possesses potential opportunities for further development of the
country's tourism industry, observers here said.
