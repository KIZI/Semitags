Why did George Bush really invade Iraq?
The weapons of mass destruction were never found
There is no evidence of any planned invasions on Israel or the U.S.
There is no evidence of any terrorists in the nation of Iraq either.
so WHY?

The reason no terrorists were found, is really quite simple. There were none. There never were any terrorists either, because Saddam Hussein would not have allowed it. The allowance of terrorists in Iraq would have offered a challenge to Hussein's power. Saddam is like Stalin. No matter how much he brutalized his people, or hated another country, or anything for that matter, no matter what, he would not allow a challenge to his power. That is what you have to understand. I'm not saying that having Hussein out of power is a bad thing, or that there was no good reason to invade Iraq. I am just telling the absolute truth. The reasons that our government gave us for invading Iraq, for lack of a better term, were lies. They were simply lies. Some people may say that we invaded Iraq for oil. That's possible, but that is not what this message is about. That is another message for another time.

Actually WMD and the means of making them were found. What was not found were stockpiles, which perhaps never existed, but wait they did, because he used them. It's possible they were destroyed, but that seems unlikely, as if rational, which he shows every evidence of being, he would have proved that. The most likely scenarios are that they are in the desert or in Syria.

 
There is no evidence of any planned invasions on Israel or the U.S.

 

There was ample evidence, videotaped of Saddam paying suicide bombers in Palestine. Also of his funding of Hamas and Hizbollah. Also of threats he made against the US, no reason to believe he would not have shared his generosity with terrorists to do us harm.

 
There is no evidence of any terrorists in the nation of Iraq either.
so WHY?

 

There was ample evidence of al Queda training camps in the North. Kneejerk liberals standard reply is, 'That's the Kurds.' Yeah, whatever.

Why did George Bush really invade Iraq?
The weapons of mass destruction were never found

They were buried and/or moved to syria

There is no evidence of any planned invasions on Israel or the U.S.

He couldn't invade, he was paying terrorist groups to attack Isreal and supporting others to attack in the US.

There is no evidence of any terrorists in the nation of Iraq either.
so WHY?

There were groups training in the north and he actually had old passenger planes for terrorists to train in on how to take over an aircraft

In the world you live in there are no terrorists, like all liberals you live in a fantasy world and 9/11 never happened. saddam did deal with the terrorist and with al queada they have the documents. Go bury your head back in the sand and maybe the real world will go away.
 
 
Terrorists in Iraq.....

Check Salman Pak

 http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontl...s/khodada.html 

Regarding your hypothesis of WMD:

Absence Of Evidence Is Not Evidence Of Absence

More than likely the WMD is in Syria (still) in the Bekaa Valley.....if any more transports move in to Iran from Syria, there is gong to be another cna of "whoop-ass" opened if not the whole six pack!
 
 
It sounds like someone watched Fahrenheit 911 too many times. It never ceases to amaze me that as long as someone sees something on a screen they take it as the truth.

Are you saying we should not have invaded iraq? The point was made through UN, let inspectors in and stop playing your games with them or else. Guy wented with the door number 2. So what is your point? Should we just had another cup of tea with him? (i mean we were talking for 12 years, practically giving and supporting an independent kurdistan, how much longer would you talk to him?)

I think he's a one post wonder.
 
 
So what your saying is there are terrorists that hate the US in every nation of the world, including the United states, but there are no terrorists in Iraq despite the fact that Saddam hated us, offered Osama refuge, funded terrorism, etc?

And Abu Nidal.

I still remember how he killed the American in his wheelchair and dumped him overboard.

I think he ran off to Syria by now. Does anyone know where he can be found and killed yet?

at the end of sadam regime, before the current war, he was found dead in his home, i believe. he lived in iraq

Kathianne, what were found in Iraq were tactical battlefield chemical weapons, no weapons of mass destruction were found. At all. And these shells we found with tactical battlefield chemical weapons, there very few of them. And they were YEARS old. THERE WERE NO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION FOUND.

Also, I'd like the see the ample evidence of al Qaeda training camps in the North. Even if they were there, that's not the point. We were told, point blank, that Saddam had connections to al Qaeda. That he had contact with them. "We have no idea what they were cooking up" -Condi Rice, 2003. Saddam didn't control the North. The terrorists there (the Islamic fundamentalist anarchists) were NOT AT ALL connected with Saddam. The leader of the group said that "truly Saddam is our enemy too". Osama bin Laden himself called Saddam "the socialist infidel". Yeah. they were in cahoots. The implication that they told us was that Saddam HAD WMD weapons (they "knew it", the "knew" he had MASSIVE AMOUNTS of WMD). WRONG. The other implication was that his connection to al Qaeda (non-existant, SECULAR CONTROL-FREAK) and that he could have GIVEN them these weapons of mass destruction. If what was given to us were not overt lies, they were VAST misrepresentations of the truth.

Ever hear of a small, tactical nuke? Small and tactical just means it isn't capable of wiping out a whole city. Anything that falls into the nuclear/biological/chemical (NBC) catagory is considered a weapon of mass destruction. The types of chemicals found in those things are really nasty. Most of the missile is just fuel and casings. Most airborne toxins take less than 12 oz. (a soda can) detonated a few hundred feet up to wipe out several city blocks. Just one of those "small, tactical" chemical rounds could wipe out a college campus, national convention, or football crowd. They're still against Iraq's terms of surrender and they're still WMD's.

There were terrorists all over Iraq and even if Saddam didn't support them, he still looked the other way and let them do their own thing. The only man we never caught after the 1993 WTC attack, we traced to Iraq, where Saddam basically gave him sanctuary.

Why did George Bush really invade Iraq?
The weapons of mass destruction were never found
There is no evidence of any planned invasions on Israel or the U.S.
There is no evidence of any terrorists in the nation of Iraq either.
so WHY?

Why? Because Bush got so tied up trying to convince Congress and our allies to go to war (with full coverage on C-SPAN) that Saddam had a month to hide his dirty laundry.

He was living in bagdahd under saddams protection. Then for some strange reason killed himself by shooting himself in the head...3 times.

We're glad to discuss and debate, first you have to have something that will open itself to such. For instance, who are you supporting and why? Another thread I suggested you start a thread on a topic you seem interested in, that has not much to do with conservative v. liberal, you have so far, chosen not to.

Mustard gas is a chemical weapon that is not a weapon of mass destruction as defined by the Bush and Blair administrations. Those were in the defunct shells we found buried in the desert. Point stands. NOT ONE weapon of mass destruction was found. Despite the fact that the administration KNEW they had the following: Serin, VX, anthrax, and several other different weapons which haven't been found. The simple fact that the 100-500 tons ("conservative estimate" of Colin Powel) of VX haven't been found, not ONE OUNCE, is really surprising. And by surprising I mean it was a shameless misrepresentation of the truth.

And SaddamDID NOT, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, permit terrorism in the parts of Iraq that he controlled. Terrorism in any form was a challenge to his totalitarian regime, and he brutal murdered terrorists along with the innocents.

The pot calls the kettle black!

A debate implies two sides that don't agree with each other. Each side presents facts that support their viewpoint. I believe that is exactly what is happening here. If this board was as slanted as you say, the moderators would have banned you and others.

As for squashing debate and intelligent political discourse, the prize should go to the the Left which has done in my opinion an extraordinary job. How often does the Left resort to name calling when debating issues? Labels like "racist", "fascist", "Nazi", "ULTRA CONSERVATIVE", "extremist", "religious nut", etc. How many campuses in this country have speech codes to suppress "insensitive" or "hate" speech (which is used to describe any speech not in sync with the Liberal elite's world view).

In the Liberal world view, there are two types of Americans.

First, "normal" people --- the one or two percent of the population who support abortion on demand (including partial birth abortion), condoms for kids, gay marriage, gun control, oppressive taxation, a bloated federal government, eliminating the death penalty, hatred for Bush, are against the war in Iraq, don't like the free market economy, are members of Greenpeace and/or the NOW and/or the NAACP, support public television, hate orthodox religious viewpoints and those that hold them, think that America is evil and run by white corporate CEOs, etc. etc. etc.

Second, the "right wing ultra conservative religious extemist Fascist Nazi ditto head fanatics", which is the remaining 98-99% of the country, who disagree (even slightly) on any one or two of the aforementioned positions held by the first group.

Mustard Gas is not a weapon of mass destruction? Just because the Bush administration didn't mention it? "Tactical chemical weapons" aren't weapons of mass destruction?

You're kidding... right? Zyklon-B wasn't mentioned by the Bush Administration either, yet Hitler used it to wipe out 6 million Jews.

Has it ever occurred to you that the WMDs were moved to Syria which will not allow any inspections at all?

Lets say for the sake of argument you are right (i think you are). What is point of your statement?
1. It does not matter if bush lied at this moment. We MUST finish this conflict with democratic (or semi-democratic) secure iraq. If goverment lied, then this should investigated and guilty part must be punish, but should it be done in this moment? Should we just pack up, say we are sorry and leave? (perhaps release sadam and give him some arms?)
2. Lets say they did not lie (my thinking) about wmd. Most of the security agencies of many goverments believed iraq had wmd, the different branches of iraq military believed they had wmd (they were thinking the other guy had it). So we cannot find them. Reasons
<li>Sadam never had, then why did they played all these games with UN? I guess in that case he overplayed his hand. </li>
<li>Sadam had them, but was able to move/hide them (say to Syria). Much good they do for him now</il>
What should we do now? Leave iraq as it is? Keep searching? (not sure how much searching you can do with security as it is)
In any case,

You're quite welcome....

I was going to add this point to my previous post....

If that single shell of mustard gas that was found had detonated properly, it would have caused several THOUSAND deaths.

So...it was a WEAPON
And it was capable of DESTRUCTION
On a MASSIVE Scale

Put them all together and you get a WMD!

Why so grumpy? Did you miss your favorite cartoon?

You anti-war/anti-US types can't handle the "target shooting" in Iraq now....what do you think you cry babies will be doing if we attacked China or Russia?

Of course, attempting to have an intelligent conversation with dopes like you is like trying to pound nails with my forehead, it's futile and just gives me a headache.
 
 
Excellent rap sheet on Abu Nidal from Rotten;
 link 

old, yes. experienced yes. leader yes. so is osama. all make this story from the telegraph plausible.
 link 

Although I'd like to believe Saddam was being charitable to an old terrorist mastermind, I know he didn't like anyone in his barrio to be bolder than himself, and entertain the notion he had bigger plans for him.

At the least, even Rotten admits, saddam was harboring a terrorist responsible for the deaths of some 900 people. At the most, he was building relations with terrorist groups by providing them a place to train and group, and a sensai.
