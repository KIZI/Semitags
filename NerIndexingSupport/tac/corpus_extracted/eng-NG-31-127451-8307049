•  Lest we forget, the Home Loan industry was deregulated by President
Ronnie Reagan.

I'm watching with interest the current Fed bailout/babysitting of the
crooked mortgage industry as regular Americans are losing their homes
and nobody's bailing *them* out. Ain't corporate welfare great!

I kinda recall the bailout of the Savings & Loan industry and how many
of the principal culprits got off the hook - as countless regular
Americans got financially taken to the cleaners. Those darn Republicans
are a lovely bunch 'o coconuts, eh?

Surely you jest.  It would have been the Democrat controlled Congress.
