Alright TSR people, I need some advice. My cousin is 17 and has recently started dating a 33 year old guy. He's a nice enough guy and they seem happy and all, but I think she should date guys her own age. Or should I just butt out and leave her to it? Am I interfering? Advice pls!
 
 
Keep out of it.
 
 
Yeah, stay out of it! It's none of your business, and if they are happy together then you have no right to interfere. Lots of girls prefer older guys anyway, so it's not a big deal.
 
 
 
Keep out of it.

 

But what if she gets hurt?
 
 
He's probably a perverted old man and will rape your cousin... get him away from her ASAP
 
 
 
But what if she gets hurt?

 

She could get hurt with someone her own age, more likely in fact as 17 year olds are hardly the maturest of people.

Surely that means it's all the more likely this guy is dating her for a bad reason?

Not necessarily, as that doesn't apply to everyone. She may be one of the teenagers that is old headed for her age. If so it's more likely she will relate to someone older than to her peer group, as the majority will be on a different level.

Somehow I feel that no matter how 'old-headed' a 17 year old girl is she won't quite be on the same level as a man with double her life experience.  
 
 
im sorry but 17 and 33 is too much. at 17 your not old enough to make your decisions in these things, young love makes you run into things way too fast.

You'd be surprised. Some people are very old headed, and you never know the guy might be a young 33. So they could both have a mental age of about 25.

Generalising all people by their age is stupid.

Isn't that what you just did.
OP it's normal for friends and family to be worried especially when the guy is double her age. Obviously it's her decision so let her learn from it if it goes wrong. On the other hand he might be someone looking for young blood so really all you can do is keep an eye on him so he doesn't take advantage of her.

No, I said it was likely he was more mature than 17 year olds, on the basis of probability that's correct. Nowhere did I say all.
 
 
she is 17 and old enough to make these decisions for herself... unless you honestly feel she is being manipulated/in some kind of danger.. rather than just disapproving because of the age gap.. then maybe tactfully air your worries... but if you know you're just weirded out by the age difference then mind your own business
 
 
This reminds me of Harry Styles and Caroline Flack :O
 
 
quite convenient that the guy happens to be twice her age... minus 1... hmmm  

anyway... as weird as it sounds... if they really like each other, he isnt using her, they have fun with each other, he isnt using her, its purely not about sex, and he isnt using her, then meh.... let them be...

understandable for you to be worried though... just keep an eye out without being snoopy...
 
 
I'd say express your opinion if you want. But at the end of the day, its her decision, and YES although there is a BIG age gap, that doesn't necessarily mean that anything is wrong or out of the way with the relationship
 
 
 
But what if she gets hurt?

 

I meant as in don't get involved for yourself, you don't want or deserve that baggage.

The rule is half your age +7.

(33/2)+7=23.5

17 is waaayyyyy too young to be dating a 33 year old. I mean wow...

Yeah thats true but even so.
 
 
Mine's 33, i'm 22... no issues  
 
 
Whenever I hear of a much older guy going out with a teenager, I always have to wonder why.. I mean, teenagers aren't adults. The only reason I've heard for why they'd go out with one was related to the younger partner being refreshing, innocent and naive.. Certainly not good reasons to start a relationship, and it's not very encouraging with regard to the older man having purely noble intentions. So.. Keep an eye out, it's a bit weird. You won't be able to stop it though, just be there to help if there is a messy fallout.

You make a lot of unfair generalisations about age gap relationships. You know, it could just be that these two actually really like each other and have a wonderful relationship. But a lot of people such as you make the automatic assumption that if there's an age gap, that there's something 'mysterious' or 'creepy' going on. That isn't always the case, you know!

I've had to deal with all this stigma myself. I'm in my late teems, my bf is in his 40s. We have a fantastic relationship and get on really well. I would rather date someone who I click with, than someone my age who I didn't get on with, and I've always preferred older men. He's not a 'creep' and there's nothing 'mysterious' going on, we just work really well together and that transcends the age gap.

To be fair to the OP, it's not THAT big an age gap....it's not like the guy is in his 50s or 60s and dating a teen. Their age gap isn't HUGE, and everyone is legal, so I think they should be left alone to enjoy their relationship without being judged.

Erm the guy is TWICE her age, that is a pretty significant age gap.
You said your late teens and your bf is in his 40s, I always wonder what attracts young girls to men so much older, I mean your just starting life and he's middle aged presumably has a career and house etc, I can't help but think it's like going out with your Dad. I'll happily admit that I'm not open minded enough to be comfortable with this and you have to accept that a lot of others will feel that way too, especially friends and even more so family.
 
 
If you're dating 17 year olds at 33, you know there's something wrong with you.

A lot of unfair generalisations? I said a teenager is not an adult. That is fact. I've asked for reasons why these relationships occur, and considered the answers I've been given. I've never really heard an answer that seems logical or rational. A normal middle-aged man will not have any interest in a normal young teenager as they are absolutely poles apart in terms of interests, experience and expectations. Sorry to burst your bubble, but stigma sometimes exists with good reason. I didn't say anything about it being creepy or mysterious, so I'm not sure why you used quote marks.

I also don't understand why you say "it's not like the guy is in his 50s or 60s and dating a teen" as if that's a bad thing. Surely if you're defending age gap relationships as a good thing, it shouldn't matter even if he was in his 50s or 60s..

what happens if they're 18 or 19?

By the dictionary definition, still a teenager. Legally, they are an adult. Mentally.. Probably not.

I personally think that in England, people don't even begin to reach adulthood until 21+. Childhood is so artificially extended in this country that young people are able to be idiots for a lot longer than they should be.

A teenager aged 18 or 19 is an adult by law. A teenager aged 16 or 17 is legally allowed to date whatever age guy she wants (as long as the guy is over 16).

These relationships occur because the guy and the girl are attracted to each other. The same reason as any relationship occurs. I'm with my bf because we're attracted to each other, we have loads in commons, and there is no other guy I'd rather be with.

Tbh I prefer older guys because they are a lot more mature. I don't know what age you are, but have you honestly tried dating guys in their late teens or early 20s? They're immature as hell. Honestly, it feels like dating a little boy to be with someone my age. Boys this age are generally very immature and not manly enough for me to view them in a romantic/sexual manner. I'd definitely not date a guy under 25. In a guy I like maturity, life experience, independence, good conversations, kindness, masculinity, stability and good sex. You just don't get these things with guys my age.

People should date or have sex with whoever they have mutual attraction with, and not let an arbitrary thing such as age get in the way of their choices. Age is irrelevant as long as you like each other (and everyone is legal).

NI disagree that people of different ages will be 'absolutely poles apart in terms of interests, experience and expectation'. It's perfectly possible for people of different ages can have lots in common. My bf and I have lots of mutual interests and the same outlook on life. So again, you're over generalising.

 
I also don't understand why you say "it's not like the guy is in his 50s or 60s and dating a teen" as if that's a bad thing.

 

I said that because Countvoncount was going on about the guy being almost twice her age, when in reality it's not a HUGE age gap. It's sizeable, but not MASSIVE. I've seen people with much bigger age gaps on here so I don't see what all the fuss is about. Seriously, leave them be to enjoy their relationship.
 
 
I suggest stay out of it for now. If you're worried, keep an eye on them, but don't interfere...unless things turn nasty and she needs help...then by all means interfere.

I'm 18, my boyfriend turns 30 in around a month. I feel a lot closer to him than I ever did to boyfriends I've had that were closer to my age. We've been together just over a year with no problems, and I couldn't be happier. It's not always wrong/creepy/pervy/dangerous. (Me and my bf been accused of all that by people who just don't understand   )
 
 
I met my 30 year old boyfriend when I was 17 and I've never been so happy with anyone. Guys generally mature at a slower rate to girls, so many are happy to date older guys so they don't have to put up with the immaturity of younger ones.
 
 
Stay out of it. It might work out, it might not. All relationships entail a risk of getting hurt. Be her friend, look out for her and the rest but leave her to make her own relationship choices. The only time I would air my concerns would be if she was clearly unhappy, he was clearly an unpleasant person or she was being taken advantage of, and those are not risks that are limited to relationships where there is a large age gap.
 
 
I'm 20 and my boyfriend is 27 (not quite the same but you see where i'm going with this) to me, the age difference feels like nothing, neither of us ever notice, and as long as shes happy, you need to be supportive of that as much as you don't like it because if you start turning on her boyfriend, you WILL push her away!
 
 
 
I met my 30 year old boyfriend when I was 17

 

How did you get together/where did you meet? I mean, you can't get in clubs so how else would people of such different ages get together??

I can understand the maturity issue I guess, as long as the guy isn't taking advantage of her. How/where did you meet your bf, given there's an age gap? Was the age gap apparent or a problem at first?
 
 
If he is a nice guy and they are happy, what's the problem? Love is love

I've done all sorts of dancing (jive, tango, blues etc) since I was about 13 and I met my boyfriend there.

I never saw the age gap as an issue because I've never got on very well with people my own age and I liked him straight away. I didn't tell him how old I was until after a couple of dates so when he asked me out he thought I was in my twenties.

When he found out I was 17, he was worried that people might think he was taking advantage of me, but I convinced him that I was fine with it and that my parents were too. Now we don't think about it at all.

Not everyone has honourable intentions, of course, so I can understand your concern for your cousin. By all means keep an eye on the situation, but the guy isn't necessarily a bad person just because he was born a few years earlier than you'd like.

(33/2)+7=23.5

17 is waaayyyyy too young to be dating a 33 year old. I mean wow...

 

These 'rules' are stupid imo. Not everyone is the same.

I honestly hate this smiley, but in this case nothing else will do.  

So you genuinely think that ALL guys under 25 are weak, immature individuals, who have nothing worthwhile to talk about and are crap in bed?!

But you on the other hand are SO much more mature than them that you're an ideal match for some bloke in his 40s?

Give me a break. You're just a jumped up little girl with daddy issues.
 
 
He was in his 30s while she was underage........

Daddy issues perhaps?

Well, frankly, I think dating a 40 year old when you're in your teens is ****ing weird.

No offence, it just freaks me out. What is wrong with dating someone your own age, besides this, there is a real chance the relationship is based entirely on the fact he's ****ing a teenager at forty and is pretty pleased with himself. I know I wouldn't start arguments if I was ****ing a teenager at 40.

Seriously, it's always the same old **** from these girls and I can't be bothered trying to respond sensibly to them anymore. I've known just as many mature young males as I have known mature young females, and yeah, that's not very many people at all, until you get to 21+ and some of them have been made to actually start acting like adults instead of living a life with zero responsibility other than who is responsible that night for buying in the shots.

"I'm really mature and guys my own age are so like, immature you know!". No honey, you're not mature, no matter what your 40 y/o boyfriend tells you. You're barely out of childhood and some old guy is enjoying moulding you into his perfect partner because you're naive and malleable. Enjoy the inevitable fallout if you ever wake up from it..
 
 
 
You said he didn't realise you were a lot younger, but did you realise he was 30 before you asked him his age?

 

After he asked first me out, I Googled his name and found his age out that way so I didn't need to ask. I tried to keep away from the subject of our ages for as long as possible as I didn't want my youth to put him off.

Just one question - when you're together with him, walking down the street, holding hands etc, does it look really obvious he's a lot older than you, like some sort of sugar daddy thing? Do you get funny looks from people? Or do you look ok together?

Heeheehee! No; he looks like he's about 24 and I can easily pass for 20 so nobody notices. I may like someone who isn't immature and can hold a decent conversation, but I don't think I'd be comfortable with the "sugar daddy thing".
 
 
Usually..... keep out of it unless it is obviously a bit dodgy. But understandable that you would be worried initially
 
 
 
But what if she gets hurt?

 

what if she does? Thats going to happen at some stage, the fact that hes 33 isnt a precourser to him breaking her heart.

 
You'd be surprised. Some people are very old headed, and you never know the guy might be a young 33. So they could both have a mental age of about 25.

 

Im 30 and i have a mental age of about a 20 year old,  

though i couldnt bring myself to date a 17 year old, its a just a bit too big a gap for me.

But its down to the peopl in the relationship if both are happy then best of luck to them

Why wouldn't you date a 17 yr old? You say you have the mental age of a 20 yr old, well then there's no much different between 20 and 17, and if she is more mature than her age then you should be a good match?
 
 
I'm in a similar situation. My sister met her boyfriend when she was 17 and he was 36, they met because he works with my dad (which to me, is weird itself!). anyways, a week after her 18th birthday my sister moved in with him. she kept theyre relationship a secret from my parents until she moved out which to me, says she knows theres something not quite right. I can't help but wonder why a 38 year old would be interested in a 19yr old and vice versa  
 
 
 
She could get hurt with someone her own age, more likely in fact as 17 year olds are hardly the maturest of people.

 

To be fair most mature people don't date teenagers when their approaching middle age.

OP, help your cousin leave this guy, seems too much like pervy loser grooming her.

Edit: Neg me all you want, if you're in your 30's and can only get with a starry eyed teenager than you deserve to be questioned on your maturity.
 
 
What a lad fair play to him pulling a girl 16 years younger hope he can keep her satisfied if you get my drift
 
 
 
Why wouldn't you date a 17 yr old? You say you have the mental age of a 20 yr old, well then there's no much different between 20 and 17, and if she is more mature than her age then you should be a good match?

 

because its still quite a big age difference

maybe i just ahvent found the right one
 
 
It's really none of your business.. well, it depends on how close you guys are? If you're more like sister&brother rather than just cousins (which is what it seems like because you care this much) i would maybe have a chat with her about it. But other than that i think it is up to her parents to do something about it if they feel like they need to.
 
 
Mind your own business, OP. If they're happy together then there shouldn't be a problem. They're both legal so stay out of it. She's 17 and can make her own decisions.
