TORONTO (AP) - Though many view Canada as an unassuming neutral nation that has skirted terrorist attacks, it has suffered its share of aggression, and intelligence officials believe at least 50 terror groups now have some presence here.

They are from Sri Lanka, Kurdistan and points between and include supporters of some of the best-known Mideast groups, including al-Qaida, authorities say.
Osama bin Laden named Canada one of five so-called Christian nations that should be targeted for acts of terror. The others, reaffirmed last year by his al-Qaida network, were the United States, Britain, Spain and Australia.

Those policy wonks down at the State Dept have obviously run out of any good ideas to take the public's mind off the fact that thanks to the meddling of two elected Bush presidents - it couldn't get any more f*cked up in the Middle East without an outbreak of mutant, anthrax-infected flesh-eating camels!

So who's to blame??

Canadians! That's who. A hotbed of terror overlayed with maple syrup and French-sounding names for beer.
 
 
Well yes - everyone knows LaBatt is shorthand for La Battaille. I mean, really  
 
 
And Elk.....dont forget Elk.

Vicious, vindictive little buggers, and crafty with it, especially the pro-Palestinian ones.

No one at the State Department is blaming Canadians. The Canadian intelligence service is reporting their findings. Why don't you blame the American State Department for solar flare activity too?

We're waiting with bated breath Brandon. The point is that the international community is laughing.

I will now make way for many posts which will cause much brow-furrowing.
 
 
Why would the internation community be laughing at Canada for reporting it's findings??
 
 
They should have listened to Dobson. See what happens when you let homosexuals marry?

Sad. You're reduced to this.
 
 
Everyone knows Canada is soft on terrorism. This is hardly news.

The Canadians are doing a good job and helping in this matter.

Why are YOU laughing at the Canadians??? Do you laugh at the Austrailians efforts also???

Translation = Canada does not attack sovereign countries in the name of fighting terrorism
 
 
Each country must make it's own decision on how to best defend itself. Nothing wrong with being spineless. Heck, France is still around, right?

Nah...Soft on immigration, yes...Not soft on terrorism. Are they related? Yes.
 
 
Actually, immigration to Canada is tough--i know, i'm trying to emmigrate someday, and it's a damned difficult standard to meet. But the Gospel according to Rush is not be gainsaid...

Neither does America. We attack those who threaten our (including Canada's) security. See Afganistan and Iraq. Both threatened our security and the threat has been reduced.

We appreciate the efforts and the support from the Canadian Govt and the majority of it's people. Every nation in the world should have great relationships such as the one the Canadians and Americans share.

Yet, there are always a few "wise apples" out there who are ill-informed and spew nonsense.

Snippet from the linked article :- "The U.S. State Department has estimated there are 40 terrorist organizations with sympathizers or supporters in the United States. "

And these people are only holidaying in the USA, are they?

But we don't hold that against you, Woiyo--we rather expect it, in fact.
 
 
 

Had to be done.

Gee...I did not realize you speak for everyone on A2K. You must think very highly of yourself.  
 
 
Feeble, Woiyo, very feeble... the level of wit here is much higher than that.

Take for example Joe's contribution... sly and hilarious at once... try to emulate that...

Probably not. Like their friends who hideout in Canada, they need to be eliminated off the face of the earth.

I am somewhat surprised this post is turning into a pissing contest between US / Canada because some fool thinks it's funny.
 
 
In another thread, georgeob1 and whoodathunk both ridiculed the notion that Americans indulge in Canada-bashing. Whooda in particular got worked up over the contention. Too bad this thread was not then in existence--it would have considerably simplified matters just to have linked it and be done.
 
 
Who's indulging in Canada-bashing?

I do not think this issue is funny at all. Your brainless posts would be annoying yet I find you so irrelevant and small that you very well may be able to hang-glide on a Dorito.
 
 
woiyo showing definite signs of improvement.
 
 
Betcha a dime to a dollar he stole the line from some teenager...

I'm most certainly not laughing at the Canadians, I've got too much respect for them, their culture and their country. As for laughing at Australia's efforts - should I so choose, I will.
