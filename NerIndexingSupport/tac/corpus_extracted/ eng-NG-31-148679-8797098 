Hello, Friends,

This is a special week for us at The Back Door.  We’re honoring my culinary
hero, Julia Child, whose birthday would be this week.  As many of you know,
I place her high on my list of people who have influenced my life.  She was
a great lady and lived her life with a great “joie d’vivre”.

Last week I was in Nova Scotia visiting my son who has been in summer school
there.  It is a beautiful part of the world.  I strongly recommend it for
any of you who love to travel.  I met wonderful people who generously shared
their kitchen secrets with me.  We’ll be exploring them in the near future.

We’ll be having Soft Shelled Crabs this weekend for our special......they
are at their peak now.  I believe I’ll have to order extras just for myself.

All my best,

Fran
