This post will hopefully convince you that allowing Iran to have nukes will stabilise the region rather than de-stabalise it, as the USA would like you to believe.

First, lets go through all the nations which have nukes and how many
Source:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...s_and_policies 

USA: 9,600
Russia: 12,000
UK: 185
France: 300
China: 240
India: 60 - 80
Pakistan: 70 - 90
N Korea: <10
Isreal: 80  http://english.aljazeera.net/news/mi...134817395.html 

If iran had nukes, it wouldn't be the only country to possess this power, in fact it would be one of many.
Pakistan which is struggling to fight the Taliban has nukes.
While Iran who has fought extremists and kept them at bay for years (including cutting off their supply of money, drug routes) isn't allowed nukes?

If Iran had nukes, their nukes would not be near as technologically advanced as say the USA's nukes or France's nukes. Nor would they have as many.
So we know they wouldn't dare actually use the nukes or they will get nuked back 10x worse.
So Iran having nukes will not cause WW3, if anything it would cause the destruction of Iran itself (if they dare use the nukes on another country which they wont because international retaliation will be much worse.

They said Iraq had nukes, (WMD's) but to this date they haven't found any. Tony blair said that they used accusing Iraq of having nukes as an excuse to invade Iraq.
So many they are using Nukes as an excuse to sanction Iran when they know Iran doesn't and will never have or even use Nukes if if gets them (which is unlikely).
Tony blair admits WMD's (nukes) where an excuse to invade Iraq:
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsJ3sMZUVms 
 http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/new...icle532480.ece 

Lets say Iran have nukes, and USA has nukes.
Both countries will be at a power deadlock, both of them not daring to make the first move.

This was seen between the USA and Soviet Russia where both countries had nukes but didn't dare use them due to the fear of retaliation.
So if Iran doesn't have nukes it is much more likley the USA will start war by attacking them because they have nothing to be afraid of.
This is bad and lots of people will be killed.

If you do not agree with me or any points listed above please argue, dont just say you dont agree.
Please read before you argue or you will look like a stupid, arrogant, pathetic excuse for a intelligent human being.

The main part of your argument seems to use similar logic to US anti-gun control proponents. "Arm everyone and we'll all be safer."

I agree with you that Iran will probably not use them, and if the did have nukes i wouldn't ever think they would use them. But the point is we don't want more Nuclear weapons being built, whatever the reason is. All it takes is one computing error, one mad dictator, one corrupt government selling their weapons on to terrorists for these weapons to be used. Nuclear weapons can kill millions, even if we're 99.9% sure Iran would never use their nuclear weapons, personally, i'd rather not take the risk.
 
 
America's running the show that's why.
 
 
because its not about country rights

its about war

if we let them have nukes they will blow us up

if you wana be pm and lead us into a nuclear war go ahead

but most people would prefer to stop them making nukes so we dont have a n war

iran is our enemy
 
 
Iran are led by nutters. Russia is as well but they are greedy bastards who want the world for themselves but they believe the nuclear fallout might dampen their hopes.

That and their mercs/BMWs will get torched in the ensuing blazetrail of nuclear fisticuffs.

Religious fruitcakes don't give a **** on the other hand.

So there ya go.
 
 
The recent Iranian election /thread
 
 
It isn't logical that any country should allow another one to have Nuclear weapons, so in my opinion Iran doesn't need the approval or acceptance of people on the matter.

Can you list all the international laws they have broken?
Iran has made HUGE efforts in stablising the region.
Loosing half a million soldiers fighting saddam ( armed with USA's chemical bombs)
And intercepting thousands of kilos of drugs from the taliban.

No they won't because they know for a fact that if they do that the whole of Iran will be whiped out.
Its called 'balance of power' where all nations are equal so nobody dares attack each other. And its proven very sucsessful in the past (if you read my thread again xD )

I can assure you the people who run iran care for iranians and want them to survive.
Infact I believe they pretend to be religious in public while they aren't that religious themselves.
It is america's fault they are incharge anyway:
USA kicked out a democratic leader and replaced him with a dictator. Who was then kicked out again and the current government ceased control.
 
The crushing of Iran's first democratically elected government launched 25 years of dictatorship under Mohammad-Rezā Shāh Pahlavi, who relied heavily on U.S.-trained secret police SAVAK[2] and U.S.-supplied weapons to hold on to power until he was overthrown in February 1979

Iran is too close to terrorist organisations to be allowed to possess nuclear weapons - it funds Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The potential for transferal of nuclear weapons to these groups is simply too high.
 
 
Because Israel, the most aggressive state in the Middle East, with as many as 200 possible nukes to its name, and the most influential lobby concerning US foreign policy, says so.

Iran is well within its right to have nukes, but in my opinion Multi-lateral disarmament is the way forward.
 
 
Erm, do you understand non-proliferation?

It's about ensuring that as few people have access to weapons capable of destroying capital cities as possible.

I don't care what you think of fairness, Clegg, it's a good idea.
 
 
So that America and European countries can prevent Iran from developing technologically and in military, so that Iran will never have a influence over any international affairs

Indeed they are, but if a nation's absolute survival is threatened and no other viable mechanism of defence can be established "an eye for an eye" is employable here. Though it must be clarified, they can only be used on military targets no civilian enclaves

Hamas and Hezbollah are as much terrorist organisations as the IDF, if not to a lesser extent. To my knowledge, neither of these groups (apart from the IDF) possess nuclear missiles.

The names you listed there are just as terrorist as Israel. In my opinion both Israel and the others are just as disgusting and evil as each other and they need to learn how to be compassionate.
If Iran did this they would risk being invaded and nuked by the USA and Nato which are much more powerful than iran.

So if Soviet Russia didn't have Nukes back in the cold war America wouldn't have nuked them?
They probably would.
But because they did have nukes there was balance of power and nobody launched any nukes.

Yep and if iran did arm them with nukes Iran would risk being invaded and nuked by the rest of the international community.

But, in a nuclear war it is inevitable. You are almost guaranteed to kill civilians. Once you drop a nuclear bomb you know that civilians MUST die, is that really applicable? Ok, lets be real for one moment. Israel is NEVER going to bomb Iran. Israel uses its nuclear advantage to gain more respect in the international community, Iran wants to do the same. It wants to become a North Korea. It wants people to stay out of its politics. Is it applicable to acquire nuclear arms for that purpose?

You make 3 mistakes in your post:

1. You assume that Iran is governed by someone who is not insane.

2. You think it will stabilise the region - no, any hint of a nuclear weapon and Israel will take out the facility and then flatten Iran.

3. You assume it has anything to do with fairness. It would be bad for us if Iran had nukes. We have nukes, so we call the shots.

Yes it is, because it will create a nice healthy balance of power.
Iran is like a scared and ambitious child.
It wants to feel safe and respected.
By telling them they can't have nukes it just makes them want nukes anymore.
Nobody said they where going to bomb Isreal or any other nation for that matter.
Would they even dare bomb Israel? I mean look at the odds. USA + Nato + Israel vs Iran.... are they that stupid?

Can you prove to me that the election wasn't democratic?
Is there any proof the current regeime cheated?
Im not saying the current regime is good, im just saying they didn't cheat. Most of Irans population are Islamic and they want a Islamic leader.
All the cheating business is just speculation.

Oh, as a person who is heavily interested in politics I am very shocked not to have seen this before?
If you dont have proof please dont say anything.
And by proof i dont mean linking a youtube video of some fanatic on the street, i mean the leaders themselves saying something along the lines of 'I want to kill the UK's army and people'
If you cant link this then shut up as you have no proof.
(And dont worry about translating it to english, I can understand the iranian language.

Iran is an extremist country. The government is dictated to by religious leaders...

I am not debating whether they are going to bomb the US. I am seeing if it is permissible to have nuclear weapons. There are many fatwas against it.

No, the respective nations will surely recognize the insanity of the given situation and attempt other ways of dealing with the matter. When it reaches to the point of an inevitable nuclear war, i'm sure that in a region as volatile as middle east all possible efforts will be used to prevent such a situation to arise.

Nuclear weapons are not exclusively made for civilian areas. They can be used to wipe out an army base, factory and a Navy fleet.

If a hostile nation is incessantly funding efforts to overthrow your government and another nation sends in spies to kidnap your civilians and then moves forward with threats of military annihilation, it seems only fair to use them as a deterrent

2. Hint of a nuclear weapon: Modern centrifuges and about 14 nuclear enrichment sites. I dont see anything coming fom Israel....

3. Exactly, so its not about Iran klling anybody. Its about the fact that the UK wants power over everybody else which is fine.
I just want to convince people Iran is not a threat.

They dont have the guts for suicide bombings they just fire missiles from the air and watch the civilians burn.
And it is right and fair to say Israel did kill civilians during the offensive last year and they did not care for the safety of civilians.

Your argument only works bilaterally - in a multilateral situation it's more like rock-paper-scizzors where nobody wins.

Also, as another said - Governments with nuclear weapons result in a more stable system, but instable Governments, aggressive nationalist countries with little to lose, or ones with ties to terrorist organisations, most certainly pose a greater threat than if they did not have nukes.

Anyway, I re-iterate - non-proliferation: the fewer countries there are with nukes, the better!

Edit: don't make me add you to the list in my sig!

Well surely you are aware of the tactical destruction of civilian provisions: The only flour mill in Gaza, UN Schools, safehouses, civilian infrastructure which Israel argues is being used to fire rockets from, yet of course they have yet to prove this. Not to mention leaving landmines and other unexploded weaponry in Lebanese territory. If that is not Terrorism, by definition rather than by western propaganda, then please enlighten me what is.

Very true.

But it goes one more step.

Iran says, it neither wants nuclear weapons nor has them. If they do have those weapons, then they have broken every agreement and undertaking with United Nations, International Atomic Energy Authority, EU negotiators and essentially international law is meaningless to them. They simply can't do that!

Do you know what the Hezbollah flag is? It has the word "Allah" with a gun on top. Hezbollah was founded by the Iran government (i.e. the Ayatollah khomeini & the Mullahs) & has been funded with Iranian money, using Iranian weapons and was trained in Iran. Can you believe there are some people who want to give the 'thumbs up' to Iran to have nuclear weapons too?

I agree with you when you say that Iran shouldn't be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, but for a different reason.

First, I don't believe for a second that Iran would give one of their nukes to a terrorist organisation, for three reasons. Number one, a nuclear programme costs billions of dollars and years to develop, it's not an AK-47 which can be made in a matter of minutes, number two, what if it backfires on Iran, what if the terrorist organisation decided to grab Iran by the balls and number three, how would a terrorist organisation go about launching such a weapon?

My argument is that Iran is run by loonies, it's unstable and should the government acquire nuclear weapons it could be fatal. Iran has already 'claimed' Bahrain à la Taiwan, now who's to stop them from annexing it à la Kuwait if they have nuclear weapons at their disposal? Not only that, but this will undoubtably cause an arms race between multiple countries in the Middle East, notably Saudia Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel. Most arms races in the most have led to war, what's to stop this scenario from developing into a full-scale nuclear war? Iran is fairly unstable at the moment and a revolution may arise sometime in the nearby future, don't you think the government may decide to destroy the uprising once and for all by hitting a particular region wth a nuke?
 
 
iran has every right to have nukes, the usa think they run the world   shut up and sit down

According to Christopher Hitchens they've now adopted a mushroom cloud on their flag....

1. The guy is deluded enough to think that people believe him when he blames Britain and the US for the protests in Iran - no, I think it was more that they think you fixed the 'election'. He thinks people seriously believe he has no aim to make a nuclear weapon. He wants to destroy Israel and to top it all off he's an extreme Muslim.

2. Because they haven't reached high enough enrichment. But as soon as they are found to have achieved enrichment beyond that needed for power generation, they will have no way to deny their way out of it. Every intelligence agency in the world knows exactly how close Iran is - and they are a few years off still. Israel is holding off because the US is hoping for a peaceful resolution. But sooner or later either Israel is going to get their air force out or someone is going to force a regime change. The only way to maintain stability is for Iran to abandon their aim for a nuke.

3. Well yeah, to be honest the main threat to the UK is not being nuked - Iran has no deployment method capable of reaching us. It is the economic affect on us from the resulting collapse of stability.

So let's just take the risk.. maybe you're right and they don't want to give up nuclear weapons.. but what if you're wrong about the same bunch of loonies that have already sponsored Hezbollah.

Either way, it doesn't matter what you think. Iran has signed international agreements with almost everyone in the world not to develop nuclear weapons. Does international law have any validity to you?

You said iran is aggresive? When was the last time Iran was aggressive towards anybody?

Terrorist organisations?
Why is Hamas a terrorist organisation.
I think they are a defensive organisation.
When Isreal BUILDS ON WEST BANK land, Hamas attacks back.
Please justify why Israel has the right to break international law before you call Hamas a terrorist organisation, these two countries are engaged in war. Do the bombing raids over germany make britain a terrorist organisation during ww2?

Iran has killed more Saddam + taliban troops then Nato USA and Russia combined.

Why does it seem fair? why should America get involved? even more so, how could a country that dictates to the world what's right and wrong conciously "obliderate" one of the oldest civilizations in the world and it civilians that have done absolutley nothing to it?

Hence this is why Iran is justified.
 
 
Thing is, theyre not going to make weapons as it is. Ahmadinejad has promised that nucleur energy and since now, he has not broken any promises

1.
If the USA and UK did this they are fair to blame them.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Ir..._d%27%C3%A9tat 
Also the USA and UK sponsored SADDAM HUSSEIN while Iran where tying to defend themselves from Saddams army.
So I think its pretty fair for them to be annoyed and pissed off.

2.
They have 20% enrichment, and getting to 20% uses up 90% of the power and recources you need to get to a level where you can make a nuke.
Israel isn't attacking iran because it knows a war isn't worth it they know Iran will never launch nukes at Israel.

3. Why would stability collapse may I ask?
There will be no war (read my above point), it will just be a dead lock. And iran will be free of anymore US intervention because the USA have intervened enough (read my first point)

International law has validity to me yes.
But it clearly has no validity to isreal who continue to build on the west bank (which is designated as palastinan land).
Whats wrong with hezbollah they where only protecting lebenon from Israel.

Because there allies. If Iran wants to become an ally of the US, it can do so. Saudi Arabia in some way are, such as the US is providing them with economical and military help. It could ‘obliterate’, albeit high unlikely, because that country has obliterated another country, remember what you said? An eye for an eye.

So you believe that because they're allies, America has the right to do another hiroshima on a country that has done absolutley nothing to it.

And yes an eye for an eye, but America eye is not involved here

But, if your brother eye is destroyed, wouldn’t you destroy the persons eye who destroyed your brother/father? How can Israel retaliate if it has been obliterated?

Things the USA have done which piss Iranians off.

1. Sell Saddam Hussein illegal chemical weapons to fight Iran with.
2. Strike a alliance with the Taliban and help them fight Russia by giving them arms.
3. Destroy the Iranian democracy
4. Support Saudi a Arabia (which have 0 human rights) while preaching human rights to Iran.
5. Deny Iran the right to nuclear weapons to protect itself.
 
 
I care more about the serious human rights issues in Iran than whether or not they have nukes.

They're not Brothers and Jews apparently are a completely different race.

I think essentially when people justify such things, it perfectly legitimizes Iran's nuclear aspirations.
 
 
Because its a country whos leader has openly stated he wishes to "wipe isreal of the face of the map".

Heh human rights are very very very important I agree with you there mate.

I hate it when people are put in jail under extreme conditions without a trial:
guantamino bay.
And then let free with an apology and jack crap compensation.

I hate it when western governments support nations who break human rights
(list of nations who break human rights more than iran and are supported by the USA)
Suadia Arabia
Iraq (during the iran iraq war)
Afghanistan (during the russia afghan war)

Can you list cases where iran has broken human rights for me (i know its happened but not to the scale we all say and think it has)

plus wiping israel off the map (translated to iranian) means removing their sovereignty, not bomb them.

I am saying hamas and hezbollah are no more terrorist than Israel which has direct control of a nuclear arsenal.
Therefore debunking your original point that iran will give 'terrorists' nukes
Which by the way will certainly not happen as it could backfire badly in two ways.

1. The terrorist organisation bribing iran with the threat of using the nuke in a way which will cause iran to be attacked by the USA e.g blowing up the USA.

2. iran being obliterated by the USA and NATO WHICH WILL HAPPEN IF IRAN DARE TO LAUNCH OR GIVE A NUKE AWAY

You do not seem to have enough knowledge about Iran.
I understand why you think Iran should not be allowed nukes because you dont even know that much about iran.

Iran has NO terrorist gangs, and iran has never attacked a country except in self defence.

Iran has lost hundreds of thousands of troops trying to kill Saddam Hussein and stop the Taliban drug trade (Saddam Hussein was being supported by the USA at the time)

Iran has better human rights than any of its immediate neighbours, and gives massive amounts of its money to charity.

Iran used to have a democracy but the USA and UK kicked the democratic leader out because he was changing the price of oil to suit the iranian people.

Its just beyond me why people are so unjust towards iran.

I might be wrong, and I want to argue so I can be sure that my viewpoints are correct.
 
 
Its funny how a third world country like Pakistan gets to have nuclear weapons..
But while it has those little boys.. All conflicts between India and Pak have come to halt..
Nuclear weapons --- Nominee for peace awards..

Secondly.. The west doesnt want Iran to have the little boys so that they can invade it like Iraq whenever the **** they feel like....

Are you suggesting that iran is going to bomb israel and then get nuked and invaded by the USA Nato and Israeli forces.

I highly doubt that, they may hate Israel but they don't hate Israel more than they love their own country (and 73million people who live there)
 
 
America calls the shots, so we don't want some little retard of a country to hold nuclear weapons and undermine the USA's power.

Iran has below satisfactory human rights.

But then Saudia Arabia

Attacking Viet Nam.

Nuking Japan.

Simply, if Iran get nukes THEY WILL NUKE ISRAEL AND WIPE IT OFF THE MAP!

America has no right to a nuclear arsenal. Face it: it's the only country to have used them against massive centres of population.

Unreliable state number one: USA
 
 
Iran has threatended to destroy Israel. Iran has supported terrorist groups in his neighborhood. Furthermore Iran has an incalculable government which has shown that they're wiling to use every means to preserve their power.
Therefore it would be a big mistake (perhaps even the biggest) to allow Iran to have nuclear weapons since the allowed occupation of the Sudeten German territories. Admitted, history doesn't repeat itself but that is not an excuse to trivilaize the ambitious efforts of some people for a second holocaust.

According to Juan Cole, a University of Michigan Professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History, Ahmadinejad's statement should be translated as:

The Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem (een rezhim-e eshghalgar-e qods) must [vanish from] the page of time (bayad az safheh-ye ruzgar mahv shavad).

According to Cole, "Ahmadinejad did not say he was going to 'wipe Israel off the map' because no such idiom exists in Persian". Instead, "He did say he hoped its regime, i.e., a Jewish-Zionist state occupying Jerusalem, would collapse.

Either way, it doesn't matter what you think. Iran has signed international agreements with almost everyone in the world not to develop nuclear weapons. Does international law have any validity to you?

 

Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon though, how would they give up something they don't have?

Iran has signed many documents, yet it was lying and was caught last year.... How are you meant to take these people seriously?

Don't get lme wrong, I'm all for Iran having nuclear power, let Turkey enrich Iran's uranium and build its rods but if a nuclear armed Iran comes about it must be stopped.

As for the first video, any idiot can record themselves signing ballot papers. It doesn't necesarrily mean cheating it could be fake.
If they where cheating why would they record it?

The second video doesn't prove anything, except that a few people don't like the islamic republic.

Okay maybe the election wasn't 100% democratic.
Doesn't deny the iranians the right to defend themselves.

If it wasn't for the shah Iran would have been crushed by saddam during the iran-iraq war.

Iran never has and never will assault another country.
But there is every chance of the USA attacking iran if they dont have a nuke as a deterrent.

Thanks for this quote from wikipedia, perhaps next time you can also mark is as one.
However, it's curious that all official sources that I've read have translated Ahmadinejads statement the same way- except of Juan Cole.
I'm not able to proof the accusation of Cole beacuse I have not any knowledge of Persian, do you have?
Nevertheless as far as I know Ahmadinejad has never official disscoiate himself from this translation.

Yeah but if iran didn't have nukes it would mean the USA would attack them as soon as they have the recources, and since Obama set a target to withdraw troops from iraq by august it wont be long till the USA is fired up again for another war.

Obama is arselicking the Mullah regime like no-one's business.

He's a deluded imbecile who thinks it's possible to "reason" with these animals. I don't think Obama would crank up the war machine with Iran, it would make him even less popular than Bush.

1) Are you making human rights a requirement for nuclear weapons? China, Russia, India and Pakistan all have terrible human rights.
2) I've heard worse and this is far from a terrible idea, think about it.
3) The US didn't 'believe in gays' when they had their nuclear programme on the go.

I do agree with you that Iran should not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, no dictatorship should, especially not a theocratic one.

Iran at the moment is almost impossible to contain as it could create an economic oil crisis, something worse than the Great Depression for example and therefore, if it ever acquires nuclear weapons it'd be impossible to contain - what's to stop it from acquiring Bahrain, which Iran has already claimed and what's to stop it from holding the world at ransom wrt oil?

Because no country should and I think it would turn them into a North Korea style state...the rest of the world too scared to stand up to the Regime.

Furthermore, Iran has a plethora of social problems...4 million opium addicts alone...spending this sort of money on weaponery is inexcusable...though that said for the past 31 years we've seen them piss our petrodollars away, so I suppose it's nothing new.

If Iran could create a 'economic oil crisis' why wouldn't it do that already.

And what do you mean by 'contain'.
Please explain your economic oil crisis further.

'the world ransom with oil' lol, you think iran is the only country with oil?

Pretty much this.
 
 
No one should have any kind of access to nuclear weapons, and it is unfortunate that some countries do.

I think that some people feel insulted by the hypocrisy of Iran not being allowed nukes. America, for example has been much less responsible with nuclear weapons, (such as fat man and little boy; Hiroshima)
than Iran would potentially ever be.

So what I'm saying is that no country has any right to possess nuclear weapons, and that no country deserves nukes any more than another.
Every country has had been unstable at some point; it is suicidal to allow any government to even be capable of considering the option of using nuclear weapons.

I disagree with you when you say that Iran should be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

First, I don't believe for a second that Iran would give one of their nukes to a terrorist organisation, for three reasons. Number one, a nuclear programme costs billions of dollars and years to develop, it's not an AK-47 which can be made in a matter of minutes, number two, what if it backfires on Iran, what if the terrorist organisation decided to grab Iran by the balls and number three, how would a terrorist organisation go about launching such a weapon?

My argument is that Iran is run by loonies, it's unstable and should the government acquire nuclear weapons it could be fatal. Iran has already 'claimed' Bahrain à la Taiwan, now who's to stop them from annexing it à la Kuwait if they have nuclear weapons at their disposal? Not only that, but this will undoubtably cause an arms race between multiple countries in the Middle East, notably Saudia Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel. Most arms races in the most have led to war, what's to stop this scenario from developing into a full-scale nuclear war? Iran is fairly unstable at the moment and a revolution may arise sometime in the nearby future, don't you think the government may decide to destroy the uprising once and for all by hitting a particular region wth a nuke?

2) Israel proposed assaulting Iran, Israel assaulted lebenon. Israel builds on west bank land.
 

How the **** is this relevant?

 
Why do they have nukes then?
 

1) 'Officially' they don't....but ignoring that because we all know they do:

THEY'RE NOT A SIGNATORY TO THE NPT...jesus christ you're daft... never mind the fact that Israel has proven to be a stable regime which doesn't make outrageous claims.

 
3) are you suggesting the iranians are planning to nuke gays?
 

No... I'm suggesting it isn't the best idea to give nuclear weapons to a despotic leader who thinks gay's don't exist and who believes the holocaust was a big joke and who is ok with wiping non-supporters off maps or relocating them to somewhere further away.

You ask for an intelligent discussion yet you cannot carry one out yourself?

But that is Irans choice.
Are you suggesting the USA want to stop iran building nukes to encourage them to spend the money to improve their economy?

I think the USA are scared of Iran standing up to them.
Why did the USA support the forced creation of Israel?
Why did the USA invade Iraq then afghanistan? they could have just bombed the terrorist compounds, why did they have to spend 10 years occupying another country?

The USA doesnt need to fear a nuclear armed Iran, it fears loosing control over Iran with the constant threat of invasion.

IRAN WILL NOT DARE ASSAULT ANY OTHER COUNTRY, look at the figures, look at the odds. Iran will be wiped out.

A fair amount of the world's oil goes through the Strait of Hormuz - the Iranian military possess many anti-air and anti-ship guns all along the coast, and could, hit every tanker entering/leaving that area. Not only that, but Iran could strike every oil field in Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

I'd say that if you control, or have the power to destroy a large portion of the world's oil you hold quite a few cards. Just imagine how many cards the Iranian government would hold if they acquired nuclear weapons.

True, however back in those days spousal rape was not frowned upon and women were not supposed to work.... this doesn't make either of those things acceptable now. Times change.

 
I do agree with you that Iran should not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, no dictatorship should, especially not a theocratic one.

oh wow another pointless discussion..... no nukes in iran as much as no nukes in germany,italy,saudi or whatever... FFS are you all too stupid to get non proliferation or what?
 
 
Well I'm pro-mulitlateral disarmament.

But if we ignore that...

I think every country has the right to arm itself in whatever way it sees fit, assuming that doing so breaks no international laws. It's just unfortunate for Iran that the USA are so powerful, that what they so goes for most of the world.

If iran dares do such a thing they will be attacked by:
USA
Nato
Arabian countries who want to sell their oil.
Israel

Such a war will result in Iran being wiped out in just less than a year.
Do you think Iran would ever dare provoke such a deadly reaction that will result in Iran being destroyed for ever?

Erm, no, but as an Iranian I think we shouldn't have nukes. Ever. Even after this regime falls.

Lmao why not?

Do you think the Mullahs actually care for Iran or its people?

"I say let this land [Iran] burn. I say let this land go up in smoke, provided Islam emerges triumphant in the rest of the world " - Khomeini

They wouldn't give a **** if there was a nuclear wipeout, they have their private jets and Swiss bank accounts. You're really on another planet, you actually believe these dictators and rapists have a human heart!

If iran started a war the mullahs would have to hide in a hole like saddam while the rest of the world hunts them like dogs.
We all know iran is capable of NOTHING with or without nukes.
So lets stop overplaying the threat and being so dramatic.

First, lets go through all the nations which have nukes and how many
Source:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...s_and_policies 

USA: 9,600
Russia: 12,000
UK: 185
France: 300
China: 240
India: 60 - 80
Pakistan: 70 - 90
N Korea: <10 ( so you think )
Isreal: 80  http://english.aljazeera.net/news/mi...134817395.html 

If iran had nukes, it wouldn't be the only country to possess this power, in fact it would be one of many.
Pakistan which is struggling to fight the Taliban has nukes.
While Iran who has fought extremists and kept them at bay for years (including cutting off their supply of money, drug routes) isn't allowed nukes?

If Iran had nukes, their nukes would not be near as technologically advanced as say the USA's nukes or France's nukes. Nor would they have as many.
So we know they wouldn't dare actually use the nukes or they will get nuked back 10x worse.
So Iran having nukes will not cause WW3, if anything it would cause the destruction of Iran itself (if they dare use the nukes on another country which they wont because international retaliation will be much worse.

They said Iraq had nukes, (WMD's) but to this date they haven't found any. Tony blair said that they used accusing Iraq of having nukes as an excuse to invade Iraq.
So many they are using Nukes as an excuse to sanction Iran when they know Iran doesn't and will never have or even use Nukes if if gets them (which is unlikely).
Tony blair admits WMD's (nukes) where an excuse to invade Iraq:
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsJ3sMZUVms 
 http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/new...icle532480.ece 

Lets say Iran have nukes, and USA has nukes.
Both countries will be at a power deadlock, both of them not daring to make the first move.

This was seen between the USA and Soviet Russia where both countries had nukes but didn't dare use them due to the fear of retaliation.
So if Iran doesn't have nukes it is much more likley the USA will start war by attacking them because they have nothing to be afraid of.
This is bad and lots of people will be killed.

If you do not agree with me or any points listed above please argue, dont just say you dont agree.
Please read before you argue or you will look like a stupid, arrogant, pathetic excuse for a intelligent human being.

 

It's about stopping countries from starting to have nukes, once they have designed a few then it's just a case of manufacturing.

If one country has nukes and another doesnt the country with nukes will boss around and control what the other country does.

If everybody has nukes nobody would dare use them due to the fear of retaliation creating a deadlock where nobody dares strike first (like sovet russia and the USA back in the cold war)

I agree, and the USA + Nato will always manufacture more than Iran, and they will always have more man power than iran, and they will always be able to kick more ass than iran.

Iran is no threat compared to the power of USA + Nato. So lets stop being dramatic and accept that iran is not a threat and they simply want access to the same ******* technology as everybody else.

Very true. And if a country has something that gives it more political power, It will suddenly seem stupid to them to get rid of it, and the country will become more interested in justifying their possession of it.

We're talking about Iran with nuclear weapons here, not Iran with a few scud missiles, which is something you've not yet thought about, your argument lacks the consequences of Iran having nukes, it's all fine saying 'why shouldn't Iran be allowed to have nukes, look Israel has a few, give Iran some', but when you take Iran's ambitions into context your argument crumbles to pieces.

Lol, 'all those people' I assume you mean soldiers.
How many people exactly?
3000? 4000? 10,000?
Do you know how huge the size of USA + Nato's army is?
They couLd CRUSH iran, and if you dont accept that you are quite deluded.
The USA on its own could easily beat iran, not to mention Nato + Israel.
No chance...
They could even well up support from the arabs with the promise of some of irans oil fields.
It would be a massacre.

What part of this don't you understand?

The Mullahs DO NOT CARE if there is a massacre! They DO NOT CARE if Iran is "crushed".

You make it sound as if they actually care for Iran's people. They do not! They never have done! The history of the Islamic Republic is 31 years of rape and slaughter of an innocent populace.

The Mullahs have siphoned Iran's oil wealth into their own deep pockets. Believe me, if ever there was a war, they'd simply run off and enjoy their billions! You really are deluded.

It's a sign of unstable despotic leadership which knows no limits.

 
Israel claims it has sovereignty over some other countries land, (jerusulem) which according to the UN is split into two parts, Israeli land and west bank land, but israel outrageously claims it has sovereignty over the whole of jerusulem.
And that is relevant because Israel is allowed nukes and iran is not.

This is probably the worst post so far. You talk about the bombing of Hiroshima as if it was unprevocked and while I don't agree that it was the right option, there is absolutly no doubt that if Iran had the only Nuclear bombs and they were at war they would use them (and then like most dictorial states try to invade other countries).
While America was probably wrong with the bombing, atmleast at the end of the war it didn't try to occupy countries - something I doubt Iran would do.

Irans main ambition is surivival.
one or two nukes dont compare to the huge aresenal owned by the USA + Nato + Israel.

Iran could not wipe anybody off the face of the earth, get real please.
Do you know how advanced the US army is?
Lets say Iran launced 40 nukes at tel aviv and jerusulem.
They would probably destroy both cities, regardless of israels amazing anti missile systems.

Then the USA fires a few thousand nukes at iran, Israel fires all its 200 - 300.
Nato follows suit.
Then US bases arond the gulf mobilise and slowly close in on iran, while it is bombed and blown up by Israel and US and Nato's amazingly advanced airforce.

Israel was brought into existence by the british mandate WHICH OCCUPIED palastine.
Arabs around palastine voted against the creation of israel.
Yet they still came into existence.
Now that israel does exist they still build on west bank land which is illegal according to the UN.

And the non proliferation treaty is not relevant, lets imagine iran decided to leave the treaty.

That doesn't change the fact that Israel is now a thing of the past and that everyone living in Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv has more than likely disintegrated.

Let me get this straight, the US and NATO are going to 'slowly close in on Iran', a country which has just been hit by 500 odd nuclear weapons? Have you heard about nuclear fallout?

Stick to your computer games.

Khomeini carried on the war for SIX YEARS after we liberated Iran under his deluded ideas of "capturing Jerusalem via Karbala"...

He dragged us through six years of unnecessary attrition warfare where millions of innocent Iranians and Iraqis were killed for absolutely no good reason. While they were at it the IRGC slowly took over all business, eliminated the political opposition and consolidated its position.

And you lot think this regime actually cares  
 
 
If its anyone who shouldnt have nukes, it'd have to be the americans.
They're the ones who blew up Nagasaki and hiroshima.

Don't be hatin'.
Peace.

And pray tell why should arabs have the say in what britain did with it's colonies?

Which means you accept my point that iran would be crushed.
Which makes your original argument invalid.
And iran would not nuke Israel due to the knowledge that they would be nuked back, much much harder.

So nobody would die and the situation would remain in deadlock where no nation dares start a war.
Perfect if you ask me.

Okay, lets get back to the original argument.
Israel has nothing to do with this.

Its relevant because it means iran has no intentions of making nukes.
In this thread I am exploring the possibility of iran making nukes.
yeah we all know iran has stated no official desire to attain nukes.

MAD fair enough, but some dictators are fairly mad and it'd only take one moment of madness to launch a nuclear weapon.

What you haven't understood is that nuclear weapons are used as bargaining chips - how do you stop Iran from annexing Bahrain à la Kuwait when the fanatics have nuclear weapons in their arsenal?

Iran is no threat compared to the power of USA + Nato. So lets stop being dramatic and accept that iran is not a threat and they simply want access to the same ******* technology as everybody else.

 

100+ years from now a technological advance a country makes in nukes today could easily spiral, america already has enough nukes to destroy a large portion of the planet so there's no use in them building more radius wise. Now I know the technology is essential for other advances but some countries having to import that tech is a small price to pay against the probably inevitable WW3 Nuke scenario. If nukes were created only a few years earlier hitler could have used them. The current power hierarchy was only a result created due to WW2, meaning USA's dominence on nukes was not due to a dictatorship and I don't believe it's worth spreading the technology to see which country it could have been one.
 
 
I agree with you OP.
I don't know if some ppl already raised this argument (I apologise for not having read the 5 pages, I did read the post though), but who do you think has the legitimacy to decide if countries should have the bomb?
Is there a country that has the absolute truth and that therefore can declare "this country is dangerous, they do not "deserve" the bomb" ?

In addition, some people raise the argument that Ahmadinejad is a dangerous guy...well that is for some of us, western guys. I have many friends from the middle east (I am myself european) and many of them (of all age) think that some Western presidents, especially G. Bush (you know, the guy that believed that the world would end with a battle btw the good and the bad on the Armageddon...yeah...) are more dangerous than their presidents. And they are not wrong on every point...

Therefore, if you try to vehiculate the values of equality, tolerance, respect, etc. that the West is supposedly exporting in those countries, you cannot refuse to give them the bomb. They have the right to have the bomb, and the same one that the United States have.

EDIT: Before, there were many conflicts btw Pakistan and India, and since they have the bomb, the tension has decreased btw both countries...

What you haven't understood is that nuclear weapons are used as bargaining chips - how do you stop Iran from annexing Bahrain à la Kuwait when the fanatics have nuclear weapons in their arsenal?

 

Hmm Stalin I agree with you.

Lets say the whole of the iranian regeime, up from the supreme leader to the person in charge of nukes suddenly goes on a frenzy, what stopping them bombing another country?

Nothing, nothing is stopping them bombing another country.

But I would rather take that risk of everybody in the iranian regime going crazy at the same time than letting the USA invade another country.
I think the USA will attack iran, what's stopping the republicans coming into power next time round.
By then the USA will be out of iraq and ready for another fight.
Cheney already said he wants to 'bomb iran'.

But if iran has nukes, cheney will have to hold himself back, because he knows the consequences of attacking iran will be worse (even though they will still crush iran many people on their side will die)

Lets look at a different scenarios involving our old friend (the USA)

USA vs USSR
Did USSR have nukes, yes.
Did USA have nukes, yes.
Both sides too scared to assault the other. The result no war and no death.

Maybe we could make something like that happen between iran and the rest of the world, where both sides are too scared to strike first and nobody dies.
Because we know that if Iran doesn't have nukes and somebody like cheney comes into power in the USA (which will eventually happen) the usa will attack iran and millions of people will die.

There's a reason the US wants to 'bomb' Iran though, because of it's nuclear programme - no nuclear programme, no bombing.

I don't think you've quite understood how dangerous a theocratic dictatorship with nuclear weapons really is, as I've said before, who'll stop them from annexing Bahrain?

Except...you know...afghanista...vietnam..... near obliteration of the world in '62....

But never mind.... completely negligible.

Not to mention everyone living in permanent fear. Always good.
 
 
The OPs argument is flawed in that it's merely using comparisons to the status quo while failing to realize that countries like Pakistan having nukes is far from ideal. You can't say handguns are better than uzis and because uzis are already out there, we should expand the amount of handguns.

Moreover, under the status quo it's less likely of a nuke hitting any place near where I am. Realpolitik.

The more countries/peoples opinions you have the more likely someone is going to do something stupid. It's basically like a game of chess, the pawns are the most important pieces because despite their quantity they need to be predicted individually and going with that metaphor the collective consciousness of governments and leaders does not seem to be very smart, so essentially it's likely to assume they will make noobish 'chess' mistakes resulting in.. war.

The arab world + US + NATO + Israel
Which are all much more powerful than iran.
So from irans perspective annexing bahrain would not be a smart ideas.

Or even worse, is if the USA have all the power so they can go round invading countries as they please.
Which they have done, and there are multiple examples.
Notice all the countries they invade didn't have nukes, they where easy targets.

They were both fronts funded by the opposing US/USSR sides.

If you really want to know why Iran can't 'annex' Bahrain or Kuwait, it's because there's a whopping great sea between them (especially Bahrain). To take Bahrain, Iran would have to take Saudi Arabia.

But there was no all out war and not that many people died compared to how it could have been if either one of the sides didnt have nukes.

Lets say the USSR didnt have nukes.
The USA would have eventually nuked the USSR and invaded them resulting in millions of deaths.

Yea, and while I don't agree with that feeding countries nukes is not the solution. In time, if all the countries in the world have nukes there would still a war, that's why armies exist, wars are always going to happen, the fact it's one sided sadly at the moment is a good thing. It's easy to underestimate a nuclear war.

I think you're in dreamland here pal.

If Iran wants Bahrain it'll take it and I highly doubt the US will come to its rescue, simply because of the nuclear risk Iran will pose to Israel, which is the flaw in your argument.

If Iran has no nuclear weapons and invades Bahrain, it'll be decimated by the US and the rest of NATO. However, if it has a few nukes in its arsenal, the picture becomes far more abstract as there's no simple solution to the crisis - the West becomes completely powerless.

Now don't you see why a nuclear Iran is a dangerous thing?

But that depends how you look at things.
I think that the USA only looks for easy targets, and if iran has nukes it will no be a easy target.

However iran without nukes, the usa with enough support will be able to eventually invade.
i mean you cant blame the iranians for being scared, both iraq and afghanistan around them have been invaded.

Lol are you saying the west will be scared of iran with a few nukes?
ha no mate, think again.

Iran has already annoyed israel and almost all other western countries.
If they dare attack bahrain, suddenly all the arabian countries will also hate iran.

And then iran will be SURROUNDED literally by hostile nations.
Israel would love to bomb iran back to the stoneage, so would the arab countries who dont want to compete with irans oil market.

Do you know how huge and advanced the US military is?
Add that up with Natos military, they have H bombs which are much much more powerful than any miserable nuke Iran will make.

Next time please try explaining and justifying what you say.

If the USA were scared to attack iran because of nukes, iran could then easily produce more nukes, bridging the gap allowing more power in the equation of war.

And the USA will be supported by countless other first world western nations such as UK France Belgium Germany Sweeden Italy and Israel.

Come on its not hard to see iran would never dare attack another country that the USA likes.

Producing Nukes is hard. Particularly in a country such as Iran which has to produce all of the parts itself. They won't be able to produce a vast number of weapons. Furthermore, it is very expensive to do so and they will need to build the launching facilities to do so.

They are already struggling to keep a Nuclear program going at the moment since their equipment keeps breaking down.

I don't see it happening either. It isn't in Iranian interests to invade Bahrain. As you said, their main trading partners would shut down all trade with them making it impossible for them to function.
 
 
As lovely as the Iranian people are, they are led by insane people. Letting Iran have Nuclear Weapons would be like giving a retarded kid fireworks.

they realise if they nuke or even attack another country they will be destroyed by the USA and lots of other countries.

No they won't attack the USA or the UK, France etc.. but they will attack someone and in all likelyhood that country will attack back, larger countries will be able to sell arms allowing the smaller countries to develop nukes/whatever faster meaning more money gets spent on war and eventually powers will shift if only due to the money being made off those smaller wars.

Remember a smaller country only has to grow to the point where if they were to work with a larger country whatever opposing larger country would became inferior.

Im sure I have answered it about 5 times.
US
Nato
Israel
Other arabian countries.

Together they will have man for man more men then iran
they will also have more nukes (prehaps 100 times more)
and they will have a much more advanced military
Also if iran attacked bahrain they would be sanctioned so they cannot trade and their economy will die

I agree with you but without a nuclear deterrent the USA is free to boss iran around for its oil and other recources
and this has happened on a extraordinary level in the past:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat

The usa TOPPLED the irarnian government and replaced it because they didnt want iran to nationalise its oil.

If iran had a nuke they would think twice before being greedy and trying to steal from iran.

Iran wouldnt dare to attack anybody else, while the USA wouldn't bother attacking iran.

whats the problem?
or do you feel uncomfortable that for once western countries cant bully middle eastern countries?

the u.s supported loads of "terrorists" organisations during the cold war (and still do to this day). israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons and also has supported terrorists groups. why the hypocrisy. Iran was truly ****** by the u.s several times, they deserve to hate America and want a nuclear weapon, they are surrounded by hundreds of thousands of U.S troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ahmadinejad is a ********, no doubt but you cannot expect them not to want a nuclear weapon. Despite all of this talk there is no much evidence that Iran even wants a nuclear weapon.

US and UK ARE G-8 nations so they have veto powers in the UN

So, lets get this straight.
Are you suggesting that if iran with a few primative nukes attacked bahrain, the rest of the world would watch and do nothing about it?

It doesn't matter how many nukes they have, the fact of the matter is that if they were to interfere they'd be nuked by Iran, which is a risk I'm sure no country in the world would be willing to take, bar the US which is of course out of Iran's range of fire(for the time being).

To think that Israel and the Arab countries would join in is simply laughable, which is why I'm finding it rather hard taking you seriously.

The west isn't taking oil away from Iran in any kind of an evil manner as you seem to imply, it is in the interest of Iran to sell oil. Without oil the Iranian populist government has no chance of maintaining its policies. No one is stealing anything from Iran, but the west is benefiting Iran by providing demand for oil and maintaining its relatively high price.

Historic injustice: I do not see how that logically entitles you to a nuclear bomb. That just makes no sense. You provide no analysis how the USA is currently interfering in internal Iranian matters.

I also think western interference is currently in the interest of Iran citizens as they are being oppressed by an undemocratic leadership that rigged the elections and uses the revolutionary guard, which employs methods not seen since Stalin/Hitler/Mussolini/Tito - pick your favourite  .

I know how the UN works, what's your point? Do you think a veto will take Bahrain back?

They'd certainly condemn it and impose sanctions, but no I can't see anything being done about it especially if Iran had nukes, the risk they pose to Israel and the oil would be far too great, which is why I don't think the West would get involved. Which is precisely why Iran cannot, under any circumstances, acquire nuclear weapons.

Why wouldn't they join in?
Israel already hates iran, and if the arabian countries dont join in (in the situation you outlined) they are at risk of being invaded themselves.

Plus irans missiles wouldn't even reach western countries, so they have nothing to loose.

I've just proved how the UN is flawed, again, what's your point?

Do you think a few men in blue hats will take Bahrain back from a country which has nuclear weapons, controls vast amounts of oil, the Strait of Hormuz and could wipe Israel off the face of the earth?

So it has nothing to do with safety or saving lives.
Its about oil and greed, and wanting to control what other nations do to maximise quality of life for a few at the expense of the many.

Therefore debunking your original point that iran will give 'terrorists' nukes
Which by the way will certainly not happen as it could backfire badly in two ways.

1. The terrorist organisation bribing iran with the threat of using the nuke in a way which will cause iran to be attacked by the USA e.g blowing up the USA.

2. iran being obliterated by the USA and NATO WHICH WILL HAPPEN IF IRAN DARE TO LAUNCH OR GIVE A NUKE AWAY

 

This isn't any form of mature discussion.

It's like:

Teacher: What didn't you do your homework?
Student: What... nobody else did theirs.

Iran has consented to a certain set of international agreements. It can't ignore them, by saying of look at Isreal and then pull an “   ” face.

They wouldn't join in because Iran poses a great threat to Israel(it could wipe it off the face of the earth if it had nuclear weapons), it controls vast amounts of oil and the Strait of Hormuz, which could send the world into another great depression.

Iranian nukes, for the time being, cannot reach the US or most of Europe, however they could hit Israel. Do you seriously think Israel will egg the US on when they have everything to lose, you're more deluded than I thought if you believe this.
 
 
they arent allowed nukes because they would be a risk to us.
its not an overly complicated concept.

short answer yes, but its a tad bit more complicated. Personally i say **** all nuclear weapons but i can see why Iran would want one, cant blame the buggers.

That's a lie, the UN never passed a Resolution allowing the war, it passed Resolution 1441 offering Iraq under Saddam Hussein "a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations" that had been set out in several previous resolutions (Resolution 660, Resolution 661, Resolution 678, Resolution 686, Resolution 687, Resolution 688, Resolution 707, Resolution 715, Resolution 986, and Resolution 1284).

I didn't say that the UN wasn't flawed. I pointed out how your example was flawed. You just equated Iran with having the same amount of influence as the most powerful country on earth. Iraq isn't even that important. However, Bahrain is in the most important region on earth.

As I mentioned earlier, no country would trade with Iran apart from North Korea and therefore, that would make it impossible for them to run such an operation for a sustained period of time.

Furthermore, the logistics of invading a country and keeping your troops supplied over the sea is fairly hard particularly when the navy and air-force of the Enemy is far more powerful.

As far as we know... bearing in mind, what you have just said below.

 
Iran has signed many documents, yet it was lying and was caught last year.... How are you meant to take these people seriously?
 

I don't get this point. So, because they were caught last year in dodgy business their other contractual obligations mean nothing.

 
Don't get lme wrong, I'm all for Iran having nuclear power, let Turkey enrich Iran's uranium and build its rods but if a nuclear armed Iran comes about it must be stopped.
 

You mean Iran at the moment? or when there is a regime change?

I genuinely think you need to have your head checked every-so-often.

Nope.Who would the target be? Israel? If so, why?I see no reason for the "Islamic republic of Iran" to nuke Israel out of existence seeing its one of the holy places for Muslims.

I'm pretty sure Pakistan would continue trading with Iran, considering that it's building a pipeline with it. I could make the case about a few other countries, notably China and Russia.

I think you must be joking. In terms of Iraq's military and economic power, it was decimated. Hussein didn't even have control of his own country. It's importance lay in the possible economic potential and the geopolitical position. Currently, Bahrain and the Saudi Arabia are far more important to the world than Iraq ever was in 2003.

Pakistan wouldn't trade with Iran. They get far more money from the USA than they ever would from a crappy pipeline from Iran.

China wouldn't. Saudi Arabia is far more important to them than Iran ever will be. They import vast amounts of more oil from SA than Iran.

Why would Russia support Iran? Only 5% of Iranian Trade is with Russia. So for Russia, Iran really means nothing to them.

Yes from "Stalins" perspective Iran isn't under any threat (even though they have been messed around with like a pawn in a chess game by the u.s several times but thats old news) im sure the Iranian leadership has a different view.

You misunderstood me, I didn't mean Iraq was important in an economic sense, I meant that it was important to deal with Iraq.

A lot of Soviet/Russian military equipment is sold to Iran, not only that but the Russians built Iran's nuclear programme, they could easily extract more money from Iran. The same applies to China, they could easily start selling Iran a lot of their old military equipment.

As for the pipeline, it runs through Iran, Pakistan and China, it's not quite 'a crappy pipeline'. Take a guess why China's building naval bases in Sri Lanka and Pakistan....

I don't see why the Chinese would sell Iran anything when the Oil price would shoot up through the roof and when their Oil Supplies that they depend on are being directly threatened.

The same with the Russians. They don't have any trade with Iran. It amounts to less than 5 billion dollars a year. They don't care about Iran. The US and Chinese are far more important.

It is just a pipeline. The Pakistanis are not getting hundreds of millions dollars for it. They already don't like each other because Iran blames Pakistan for the Sunni Insurgency on their border. They are not going to trade with each other in a time of war.

A military attack is not the only form of attack. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat#U. S._role. Now you can dismiss this and say it was 60 years ago but im sure the Iranians do have a genuine fear of "attack" from the U.S. Whether its justified is debatable but it seems clear to me why the Iranian leadership is so paranoid.

Remember the coup was the overthrow of a "democratically" elected PM. Shame on the CIA.

There is no point polarizing such complicated issues by making such remarks. Israel is not "out of control" they are very much in control (ask any Palestinian) and Iran does support terrorist organisations and clearly doesnt have respect for the rights of even its own citizens.

If you remember the recent Iraq Inquiry, in his testimony the British Ambassador to the USA, called C. Rice on the day of the attacks and she was saying that she thinks that Hussein was involved.

I'm simply trying explain why the Iranians have the mindset they do and why it is to an extent justified. Should emphasise the to an extent, a lot of what they do is not justified. I think its to easy to point the blame at the Iranians or the Israelis or even the Americans, one has to try and look at the facts and make a somewhat objective decision.

Yeh, true. People forget about how devastating the Iran-Iraq war was and that the USA supported Iraq throughout the entire event even when Iraq was using Chemical weapons. The USA actually blocked condemnation of the use of the chemical weapons by Iraq by the UN.

Supposedly, the nuclear program was stopped directly after the 1979 revolution since the Ayatollah Khomeni declared Nuclear weapons to be Satanic or something like that and it was restarted after the continual use of chemical weapons by the Iraqi's in the Iran-Iraq War.

Obviously before that, you had the support of the Iranian Shah, who a lot of Iranians hated and the toppling the Iranian "democracy". Before, that there were numerous other things that the British did.

Not irrelevant, for instance, if Iran was to become a democracy and strengthen its ties with the West, but more important Israel and its neighbours, then I'd have no problem against Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Having said that, what would be the point of it acquiring nuclear weapons if it has a good relationship with the West and its neighbours - who poses Iran a threat?

I never supported a nuclear Iran in the first place, the thread I made was about how we'd go about stopping Iran if it was acquiring or if it had acquired nuclear weapons.

Look at it from irans point of view.

One day iran had a democracy, but because the new democratic government threatened to nationalise oil and kick the british oil company out the democracy was thrown away by the USA + UK and replaced with the shah.

The shah regime committed atrocities to human rights and killed thousands of protestors and politics opponents.
The shah regime was not democratic, and you could not vote for a new government.

Eventually after a long period of unrest the shah is kicked out and a democratically elected leader if brought into power.
Suddenly Saddam Hussein attacks iran, backed with chemical weapons and intelligence by the USA
The USA engages iranian ships in the persian gulf.

Eventually after around 1million fatalities iraq and its western backers stop assaulting iran.

Iran rebuilds is economy but is suspicious of the west.

Iran sees iraq and afghanistan (two countries on either side of it) invaded by the usa, then the usa proceeds to set bases around the persian gulf and countries nearby such as turkey.

Out of desperation iran looks to the past and remembers how the USA bitterly and unfairly attacked iran directly and indirectly, and decides to invest in nuclear technology to hopefully stop the USA attacking again.

Finally we agree on something.

Would it be possible to take away nuclear weapons from all countries?
No.

So the next best thing is to allow everybody to have nuclear weaponry so there is a healthy balance of power.
If you attack that country they will nuke you, so its best to stay put!

Irans domestic policy has nothing to do with its foreign policy.
So stop being so dramatic and come up with a good argument rather than a insult.
Yet again you have proved that my posts offer a lot more insight to yours because all you do is insult and say one - two sentence answers.

I have said this before and I will say this again.
Iran with nuclear weapons will only have capability to use its nukes as a detterant rather than a aggressive tool.
If iran attacks another country it will get the same but many many times worse.

The leaders of iran are not loonies they are just scared 'children' if you like, they have been oppressed (as outlined by my previous post) by the USA and are resentful.
By giving them nuclear weapons we give them a false sense of security so they can think they are safe while their nuclear arsenal is nothing compared to the USA + Allies nuclear aresenal.

Yet again you have proved that my posts offer a lot more insight to yours because all you do is insult and say one - two sentence answers.

I have said this before and I will say this again.
Iran with nuclear weapons will only have capability to use its nukes as a detterant rather than a aggressive tool.
If iran attacks another country it will get the same but many many times worse.

The leaders of iran are not loonies they are just scared 'children' if you like, they have been oppressed (as outlined by my previous post) by the USA and are resentful.
By giving them nuclear weapons we give them a false sense of security so they can think they are safe while their nuclear arsenal is nothing compared to the USA + Allies nuclear aresenal.

 

Again, most of the stuff in your posts is nonsensical.

Dramatic - I've given you might point of view you ******* buffoon, I don't care that you're a vile supporter of the Iranian government and couldn't care less about its people, I on the otherhand do, which is why nuclear weapons is the worst case scenario.

Why are you such a naive clown? Iran will be able to use their nukes in whichever way they see fit, there's nothing certain about this world, let alone a bunch of fanatics with nuclear weapons.

You're turning into an apologist and it has become rather apparent that you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to the Iranian government. They hijacked the 1979 revolution and turned the people back into the misery they were in under the Shah, yet you support them, again, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.

Air strikes and artillery don't mean dick when you have a nuke hurtling at you.

Its funny you should say that because i am an iranian living in iran myself and i didnt vote for the current reigime.

My father also got shot (but survived) the iran iraq war.

You think iran's leaders are crazy mental headed idiots.
You are wrong, they are sly foxes.
They are greedy and want a good rich lifestyle.
They take advantage of the masses and make it look like they care for the security of iran, when they don't they care for their own welfare.

You think that if iran got a nuke it would just launch it at anybody regardless of the heavy consequences, just like taliban extreamists who blow themselves up.

Let me tell you there is a big difference between a extreamist and a greedy mullah.
The greedy mullah WANTS material goods, which is why most of the reigime have been to private schools, because they wanted a good degree so they can get a well paid job so they can live an easy life.

If they, the greedy mullahs decide to bomb another country, IT WOULD without a doubt provoke a massive backlash by the whole of the international community.

At the very least everything from the internet to basic food will be sanctioned.

At the worst the USA will unleash its highly technical nuclear aresenal
Iran can barley hit most of turkey with its pathetic missles while the USA can hit almost any target on the planet.

How the **** do you think the mullahs would stand a chance.
They know launching that missile would mean destruction of their rich easy lifestyles.

It really doesn't make sense to assume they would dare do such a thing.

Iran would not stand a chance and would be destroyed.
Iran would know that and wouldn't dare give a nuke away

 

You have yet answered why they actually need Nukes. And what are you on about? Iran would be punished, how do you propose that? You already said Nuking them would be wrong and how would you punish the perpertrators as oppose to the people, who already have to quietly watch on as significant amounts of their money is frittered away on pointless military projects and honestly they don't have that much to be wasted. I don't understand how you can defend a dictators lust for nuclear weapons (when the country is clearly not in a position to pay for them without harming the citizen standard of living further).

Yeah im happy, now the USA cant just barge in their and invade their country, which would result in lots of people being killed.

Oh and did i mention, Israel has nukes anyway, so iran wouldn't nuke israel because iran would be nuked back much worse.
It wouldn't make strategical sense to attack a country much more powerful than you.

I mean I have nothing against israel, they just have a very large advanced army and it would be stupid for iran to attack them and as i said it wouldn't make sense.

Well if iran had nukes the USA would think twice before attacking them.

One day iran had a democracy, but because the new democratic government threatened to nationalise oil and kick the british oil company out the democracy was thrown away by the USA + UK and replaced with the shah.

The shah regime committed atrocities to human rights and killed thousands of protestors and politics opponents.
The shah regime was not democratic, and you could not vote for a new government.

Eventually after a long period of unrest the shah is kicked out and a democratically elected leader if brought into power.
Suddenly Saddam Hussein attacks iran, backed with chemical weapons and intelligence by the USA
The USA engages iranian ships in the persian gulf.

Eventually after around 1million fatalities iraq and its western backers stop assaulting iran.

Iran rebuilds is economy but is suspicious of the west.

Iran sees iraq and afghanistan (two countries on either side of it) invaded by the usa, then the usa proceeds to set bases around the persian gulf and countries nearby such as turkey.

Out of desperation iran looks to the past and remembers how the USA bitterly and unfairly attacked iran directly and indirectly, and decides to invest in nuclear technology to hopefully stop the USA attacking again.

You're an Iranian living in Iran and you support the government - I'm finding this incredibly hard to believe. I think you're full of ****, as for the rest of your argument, I have absolutely no idea what you're trying to say, you just seem to type a lot of words and hope for the best.

I've made my point many times, something which you've yet to counter, so until then, carry on without me.

*Sigh* I was merely saying that it is all to easy to critise America for the Hiroshima bombings. I clearly used a hypothetical situation that if Iran was in America's situation (i.e. At war with Japan/Austio-Germany) that they would have done the same (i.e. used nuclear weapons) and probably would have occupied the land they gained (where as America withdrew and established demorcaries), government dictators tend to only want to extend their own power (i.e. attempt to get nuclear bombs) so don't try to even imply that Iran has any form of moral high-ground.

Because you clearly know US plans. You also know the US would have barged into NK killing lots of people, people who are the happiest on the planet and don't suffer at all at the hands of a buffon leader.

You know what, stop talking to me, stop quoting me, you're an imbecile.

Both countries simular to Iran, run by terrorists (just note that I also see dictators as glorified terrorists), and fuel evil in the world. There is clearly no point is debating with you appear to be blindly in love with the corrupt failing system (which wants to waste more money on Nuclear bombs). But then again if you have relations/ are from Iran you clearly are one of the benficaries of such an unfair system. And if not radicalised by stories from hate preachers and other anti-amercians.
 
 
Iran should not be allowed nukes mainly because the country is politically unstable, you got terrorist organisations and loads of radical people that could use it on nations that use their free speech to talk about and draw mohammad.

I stand with the security council on this, Iran having nuclear weapons would only allow it to bully smaller nations and we don't want that

I dont want Iran to have a nuclear weapon but surely you can see why they would want one and also the hypocrisy in the U.S and Israel

 

That implies that Iran is under any immediate or long-term danger of military action being taken against it. The USA is tied up in Afpak and Iraq and the public opinion wouldn't allow them to open another theatre of war. Israel does not have the logistics.

Even if anyone could, why would they want to attack Iran? It has bad economic and diplomatic implications with the muslim world. Any danger Iran is in is based purely on their nuclear program and even then small surgical strikes would be preferable to a full-blown invasion.

If invasions could be surgical then one might even be legitimate as the current Iranian government needs to go - oppressing citizens, censorship, funding terrorism, etc.

EDIT: This logic that because of the policies of the Reagan administration Americans will surely attack again is in a word retarded - in more words: very very retarded and some more.

I think the implications within the Muslim world,at least politically, would be fairly muted considering that most of the Muslim Governments such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia are vehemently opposed to a Nuclear Iran. Amongst ordinary Muslims, there would be a popular reaction to any US reaction but then that isn't really important.

A US invasion of Iran is unlikely, though I wouldn't say it is because the US is tied up in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US are going to start to withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan soon, so I doubt that will be much of a problem.

I agree with all those points. I think your post implies that Muslim countries would be against invading a non-nuclear Iran. Is that correct? That was always my impression.

Yes, at the moment, they wouldn't be for an invasion simply because they don't like the US dictating the terms in the region. Also sanctions seem to be working against the Iranians.

Perhaps there will be an invasion against an Iran threatened to go Nuclear but I don't see it going that far. An invasion is an incredibly unlikely option. Iran has a strong army and such a war would result in a mess.

I think the Iranians are acting this way at the moment since they know the US is in a relatively weak position to take serious action against it.

India annexed Goa and Iraq annexed Kuwait, I couldn't care less if it's useful or not, the fact of the matter is that it happens.

If Saddam had an arsenal full of nuclear weapons when he annexed Kuwait I doubt the 'allies' would've thought about liberating it.
 
 
Halfheartedness only leads to embarrassment, If countries don't want Iran acquiring Nukes, then aim their own nukes away from them and destroy them so it gives Iranian and their countries a reason to feel safe.

Yes, but Kuwait borders Iraq and no matter how flimsy, Iraq did have a 'claim' on it. The only reason it's known as Kuwait and not Iraq is because Britain annexed it after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and made it independent in 1961. There is no reason for Iran to want to take Iraq, and it would be a logistical nightmare. To give more local examples, Iraq taking Kuwait, geographically would be like the Republic of Island taking Northern Island, whilst Iran taking Iraq would be like the UK taking Calais.

I agree with you that Iran will probably not use them, and if the did have nukes i wouldn't ever think they would use them. But the point is we don't want more Nuclear weapons being built, whatever the reason is. All it takes is one computing error, one mad dictator, one corrupt government selling their weapons on to terrorists for these weapons to be used. Nuclear weapons can kill millions, even if we're 99.9% sure Iran would never use their nuclear weapons, personally, i'd rather not take the risk.

 

I agree. OP's logic is flawed. Instead we should be focusing on disarming Israel.

Made a similar thread myself. Cannot see why Iran is not allowed to get nuke weapons. This sort of diplomatic warfare is nothing but a bad doublestandard at play.

If the US/UN wants to stop Iran from getting that weapon, perhaps it is a good idea to weed out their own neuclear arsenal first... You know, set an example

Because the US is a stable democratic country. Iran is a dictatorship that thinks of the entire world should be run according to Islam or at least their version of it.

well I have a hard time calling the US stable since it is flirting with the thought of banning gays from getting married, running an unconstitutional prison, suspending its own constitution, waging an illegal war, killing innconcent civillians in other countries, founding terrorists. etc etc. :P

not everyone is perfect...

The banning of gays getting married will never get through due to the consitution. Technicaly the war was not illegal go look at the was tony blair a war criminal thread. Show me an example of deliberate killing of other countries innocent civilians.

Iran also funds terrorists.

Look we can argue this all night but the US is a far more stable country than Iran and is not run by a group of theocratic nutcases that think the world should be run according to Islam. Because a country that thinks this should really be trusted with the most destructive weapon known to man.

This. From Irans point of view though, I still would say it is unfair how a hostile force in the region is allowed to posess such weapons yet make a big deal when Iran even attempts to look at the idea of their own nuclear weapons.

So there ya go.

 

What a nice summary of the tabloids take on the issue. I would say its far more complex then "nutters" and "religious fruitcakes". Maybe read about on the topic and see for yourself. I know if I was in charge of a country that had seen to nearby states invaded, I would also be a bit erratic. This behaviour is only distorted by our media in, judging by your post, an obvious attempt to discredit the president.

Nice summary of someone who doesn't know **** all about those countires.

You really think iran wouldn't use nukes as a bartering tool in telling someone to F-off when they decide to do something? Israel is the same but they can be told off by their mother the US of A.

Russia is a whole other thing.

Remember the invasions of chechnya? Of Georgia? Nobody dared to raise a weapon their way because 1: Russians do not give a crap what they say and 2: They wouldn't hesitate to launch WW3 should they see fit to 'protect their borders'. It is in their mentality as a people and as a superpower with a lot of nukes.

When the EU says "Stop that!" what do you think the russians do? They take a swig of vodka, utter some words and kick a puppy. They just dont care about national borders execept that if they did cross it, war is pretty close and that is why I mentioned mercs and nutjobs in different sentences.

mercs dont go with you to paradise, a fair few virgins do. lol

When the UN itself says that the war is illegal, plus severeal legal expert, plus the failure to optain the second resolution would render the danm war illegal...

all in all, it is freaking hard to justify the war itself.

As for the US being a stable country, I highly doubt so.

Yes I can. Because you seem to have a diluted idea of what 'stable' is.

A country who goes to war unprovoked, is in my books not a stable country.
