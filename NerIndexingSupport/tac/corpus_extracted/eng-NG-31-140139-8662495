The new Away Shirt ( and acouple of other things )

Well just back from last nights game , the new away shirt was on sale in the Club Shop , the material seems  a bit thicker  than that of the home shirt  and it stretches , but beware ! I have an XL home shirt which , worn over a T-shirt, is still fairly loose , but the away shirt ;-

(Scene :- the club shop )

Me: '' an away shirt in XL please

Kelly: '' do you want to try it on ?  ''

Me : '' no I've got an XL home one so I suppose they're the same size ''

Kelly ;'' no they are a bit smaller actually ''

Me (naively): '' oh well I'd better have an XXL to be on the safe side ''

Later that evening , modelling  the shirt , with and without underlying t-shirt , my room-mates opinion is that it is  a bit clingy  and the fabric  is being stretched a bit too much (you fat b-----d ! I hear you cry ! ) , so back to the shop next Monday  to get an XXXL then ! Room mate is also worried in that he only bought an XL ! ,no doubt he will be on here later , after he has tried his own shirt on , to confirm the smaller sizes . So be warned

''The Grecians played the better football, were more clinical in front of goal and were just about good value for a three point return........''

Oops , sorry I mean  the TV  positions for Setanta  have been  erected at the Park . One at the back of  either end of the Doble Stand ( probably taking up about 20 seats each ), with the commentary gantry on the half way line , and one behind the away end .There is nothing as yet  behind the Big Bank goal . I am told that these will be permanent fixtures for the next 3 years ( or however long their contract lasts )

What you see is what we have for 3 years or less.  The camera position in
the Away End was chosen so that it shows the game with a hopefully packed
Big Bank in the background rather than the view from the other end into a
sparsely populated Away End as per Sky

well maybe we should as home fans be able to swap ends at half time to
support our club, at either end , that would be fantastic, anyone ever
asked the club re this?

There would be the problem of monitoring the numbers moving into the away
end if they don't go in via a turnstile so that we don't exceed its licensed
capacity of 1053.  Also what route would they take from the BB to the away
end so that they don't make a detour into a seated area they haven't paid
for?

So shove the bleddy away fans back into the away end ! - why couldn't they
be seated in the away section of the old grandstand anyway ?

A bit of black dishcloth and a laminated A4 sign saying "away fans" is
hardly good segregation is it.

I am that room mate and I am indeed on here with my own tale of woe.

Tried my XL and let's say its 'snug'.

Julie's response was conclusive "You can't wear that"!

Someone seems to have had a rush of blood and had the new away shirt
designed in the 'figure hugging' style that the Italian Football and the
England Rugby tried disastrously a few years ago. If you remember the Rugby
people had to issue a new replica 'supporters' version as no one was
interested in buying or certainly wearing the original.

I think we'll have the same problem as most supporters with the best will in
the world don't have the 'figure' to wear this style of shirt.

I'll take mine back on Monday but I suspect that even buying a much, much,
bigger one won't help as it's the inherent design that's the problem rather
than the size.

MessageSteve,

I believe it's related to the players being "mauled" by opposing fans as they exit the tunnel. I think the last 3 managers have wanted the away fans moved, and Tis is the first to get his wish.

If away fans want to sit why not put them in block c rather than a of the
OG? Theres no segregation in there anyhow.
 
 
  "Martin Ellicott" <mar...@mellicott.eclipse.co.uk>  
  2007-08-15T16:15:00  
Maybe because we can legitimately charge them £16 instead of £13?

They could always go and stand on the Big Bank for less, as long as
they don't wear their colours and make it obvious who they are
supporting..

I tend to stand with the home fans, when I go to games where crowds
are segregated (thankfully it doesn't happen to often), simply
because in general you get  a better view - i.e stood somewhere by
the halfway line, rather than at one end. For instance, i  never ever
stood in the Barn Park end at Home Park, for that very reason.

No offence but the same could be said for the end block in the Flybe, sorry
don't know the block number off top of my head. Block A of the OG is the best
place but Tisdale wanted them moved, the club have to provide seating so
block C  is as good as anywhere else and the Flybe should be kept 'home' fans
only, its  newer with the more modern facilities, and will be better looked after
by home  fans.

Which is exactly why I always go in with the home fans, whenever i go
to games where the crowd has to be segregated (which is not that often!)

What a lot of rubbish ! - how do the little darlings cope at away games ?
Maybe there is a new line for ECFC ear muffs so they can't hear any of it,
and we could get some placed at the away end corner flags ready for Deano
and Andy Taylor to use, plus one behind the goal for Jones/Marriott.  And
isn't half the tunnel side City fans ? Surely the players aren't that hurt
by a few verbal's for 5 seconds when they run out? If it's any worse than
verbal's, then a couple of well placed stewards on the steps by the side of
the tunnel should do it.

How do us home fans cope with the maulings now that we have to walk past
these vicious bunch of mauling away fans as we make our way to the tea hut,
or come into the ground via the same turnstyles, share the urinals as we
take a leak?

Give the shed back to the home supporters stuff the away fans back in the
old grandstand and tell the players to grow up!

Next workparty - build a little roof on the tunnel and construct one of
those pully out tunnel thingies that other clubs use.

Decided to do a Mike B and watch some lower league football this season and
so far have been impressed………..

Brackley Town play at the St James Road stadium and also play in red and
white (hoops!) have just been promoted into the same league as Team Bath, so
thought I could keep an eye on the players in the league when City aren’t
playing near me.

As you would expect the players come from the local area, but I was
surprised to find the manager is now Phil Lines (Nuneaton V Middlesboro
FACUP fame), the captain is ex-Northampton Dave Savage (30 ish) and they
also have Justin Jackson of conference fame with Doncaster Rovers and
Morecambe. They also include Tom Winters rejected from OUFC due to serious
illness a few years back a la Dieter Hamman. Now fully recovered and playing
well.

For club with a crowd of around 250-300 they are funded by the
Chairmen/ex-Chairmen of the Royal Mail? (Alan Leighton), and boast a re-laid
pitch and two new stands being built behind the goals.  They are aiming for
the Conference South ASAP. I saw a pre-season friendly where they dispatched
Solihull Moors formerly (Moor Green and Solihull Boro) two weeks ago. They
beat Swindon Supermarine (also promoted from the South West section) to the
BGB Premier, comfortably 2 goals to nil. They did this with 10 men on the
pitch for a good 45 minutes due to a harsh decision for a strong tackle in
the wet! There first goal from Winter’s was a class free-kick.

So for £10 including a pint I saw a club really trying to better
themselves………. A club who played Havant & Waterlooville in the round prior
to the 1st round FACUP, they lost to H & W who lost against Millwall!

Might be worth doing a friendly with them next season as they pull in good
youngsters from as far away as Birmingham, we also might pickup a bargain!

Always good fun visiting the really small clubs; I visited Highworth
Town v Wooton Bassett yesterday. 0-0 in front of 177 which was about
double the average! Good game though with some distinctly agricultural
tackling - one red card and five yellows!

Jarrow Roofing Boldon Community Association. They had Paul Chow
playing for them at the time who had a trial at Exeter City the
season before that.,
