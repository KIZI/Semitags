Membership on this web group seems like an obvious way for us to stay in touch and discuss our issues locally and there has been more activity lately. Bring it on.

What about membership in the new South Sound Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation for you all?  The website members seem like an obvious group to gather under the Chapter umbrella.  But the obvious is not what Surfrider is about.  Surfrider is about leveraging membership to accomplish environmental and beach access goals.  Surfrider membership gives value in the local actions that we as a group take. PLEASE USE THIS WEBSITE TO BRING YOUR IDEAS FORWARD for opportunities for volunteers to take action in arenas that are important to us locally (such as the federal Oil Spill legislation that is the target of our postcard party this Tuesday).

And beyond the obvious, think about what new ideas might bring members to the South Sound Chapter.  While you are at it, check out the views of Jim Moriarty below on breaking the mold on membership growth.  Perhaps there is a message here for us in the South Sound.  We already give membershis to participants of the Clean Water Classic. What other inovative ways are there to grease the skids for new members? (Jim is CEO of the Surfrider Foundation, lives in Solana Beach (north San Diego County), and a very straight-forward guy who whole heartedly invites me to go surfing every time I go to San Diego.)
