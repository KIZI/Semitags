 
 
why do you love the Christ
 
 
hello my brothers and sisters in the lord.
This is a thread to announce that you are a fellow child in Christ, and that you believe.

If you got an amazing testimony, any thing you wanna say. Please say it to help us evangelise others.

My testimony:
i was born in China, i am 19. When i was 6/7(still age of accountability), i was on a plane to beijin. I saw a structure on a cloud, i later found out it was a Christian church(protestant like). Now back then everything was still tightly state controled, it was very very unlikely for us to see a western building, let alone a church. therefore i didn't know what it was. God bought me to england, and at 16 i have finally remembered it was a Christian church. god then bought me to this university and tought me an important lesson in humility, now i am his child.

There are others with similar experiences to me, there is a video called "evidence for heaven", you can buy it on ebay. It has thousands of eye witness testimonys.

also, 2 web sites are very very good
 http://www.christiananswers.net/evangelism/home.html 
and the main site-christiananswers.net

I have lived a life of a science guy and an atheist guy. Now i am a christian, and its so much better!!!!!  

Blessings to you all
 
 
I guess the Christ story is the greatest mystery ever told; I can see why people love the Christ. He embodies the divine order which was devised by the priest of Heliopolis in the cult of the sun. All of this (and more) came from the Egyptian obsession with the afterlife - of which the Christ-King - plays a central role - in the parlance of the Egyptians: a transfigured Shining Akh (or soul).

The ultimate expression of the Christ is that he merges with the creator in the heavens before his descent into the perilous underworld where the suffering and agony had taken place. Here is the meaning of the cross! The true cross which is the Tat Pillar of Ptah in which God's son the carpenter and architect Imhotep is born and restores Egypt (the land which mirrors the heavens) to a golden age - the restoring of Maat; of justice and righteousness.

The story is truly wonderfull and powerfull.
 
 
Because I believe He died for me in love. It couldn't be simpler in that sense.

Can you just not, like, spam this thread with your off-topic postings please  

In response to the OP, because without God I would be dead. God has gotten me thus far, He has supported me, picked me up when I'm down. God is the closest thing to me emotionally. God understands me and helps me, He guides me and is always there when I need Him

Do you not have family or friends?

I just find that someone who physically exists and can communicate is better at guidance and emotional support.

yet despite not having that, God has kept me going - and having God by my side all the time is far better than someone I may see infrequently and someone who may change their mind often.

I agree,  . I love Christ, as my personal Savior (I don't need to prefix it with "the" because its too impersonal). He answers prayers, and cares for me even when I am having a moaning session which is a lot.  

I suppose my reasoning is selfish but I just feel He is worth so much and is so awesome that He warrants my love, yet my love is not even worth 0.00000000000000000000001% of his. He lived in the world but was not of the world, and was so amazingly pure in all his actions, even his love for those who put Him on the cross.

You do have a true friend ( see John 15:13 - sorry to be clich but I know I am right   ). Christ love is amazing and He will always be Your friend.

I know I am overstepping the mark but are you ok? I know I would feel lost without my family and friends. I hope you are fine.

I know   I was going to write that into my post but decided against it briefly. Coincidentally, I'm not really ok   I have a thread in H&R actually

Awww...   I hope things will get better, if I remember I will pray about it (I can't promise I will pray about it because I am obscenely bad at breaking promises atm   ). Feel free to PM me although I give rubbish advice, I will at least give it from a Christian perspective.

I am going to overstep the mark a bit but do you have much Christian fellowship? Are you at uni? If so try to join the happenings there, e.g. CU and maybe you will find cool, crazy people who share your beliefs and help you root yourself further in Christ. Or if you are at church generally, try and put yourself out there and try to sit beside someone your age who looks approachable and talk to them, suggest coffee meetings etc. (maybe accountability partners e.g.). Sorry, I don't mean to be rude so please don't think that I am trying to be, I am just think of ways to conquer your lonliness or something.

oh my gosh no, you're not overstepping the mark at all and you're not coming across as rude - although I did have to laugh at the bolded bit; I'm the vice-president of my uni's CU, I'm in a choir, I go to church youth groups, I'm very proactive in doing things/helping others, getting that interaction. As for deepening my faith, I'm doing a Theology degree

Tbh, if you don't think God exists, then you're not gonna bother asking Him for help, so you don't need to worry about it - go to your "physically here" friends, instead. I'm not gonna get into a massive theological debate and hijack the OP's thread.
 
 
I am a follower in Christ and I believe! (great idea for a thread!)

Being a Christian is the most amazing thing in and outside of this world. Christ is My Saviour, My God, My Redeemer, My Lord, My Brother and My Friend. He is better than any relationship I will ever have in this world. He loves me more than anyone else ever will, and He loves everyone else this same infinite amount also. For God though, love isn't an action... it's who He is. God Himself, above all things, is love.

God is also perfectly just, which is a true joy. It's amazing that our Lord is so powerful, so infinitely wise, so pure, and so holy. So good that His definition of good is perfect, and yet we can call our God 'Father'. That's what Christ has done. Even though I am an idolator, a blasphemer, a thief, an adulteress (Jesus says to look at someone with lust is to commit adultery), a coveter, a liar, a murderer (Jesus says to look at someone with hate is to murder) and I don't treat God the way that I should. He is the infinite ruler of our universe... and I told Him to shove off.

The concept of grace is to get something we don't deserve, to know that we are so worthless and weak and frail and full of our rebellion and treat God in such a disgusting way- and yet He still loves us. One of the most beautiful passages I think in the Bible as right after God bans Adam and Eve from the Garden, he clothes them. What a beautiful picture of love that He still cares for the two people who have just told him to shove off and that despite all He'd given them, they'd rather live without Him thank you very much.

I love Christ because of what He has done for me. He has enabled me to have a relationship with God. God's justice and love was reconciled upon the Cross, where Christ died for us. He didn't have to- God's justice would have been served to send each one of us to hell where we deserve to be. But because of God's infinite grace and mercy, He chose to punish Himself- Christ is a form of God in the Trinity- instead of us. Christ offers us forgiveness of sins through His death on the Cross, because God looks at Christ, and sees that He has paid our sin, and therefore Christ gave us righteousness- to be right with God, God's seal of approval. God sees me, in all my sin and shame, and says that I'm okay by Him because He sees Christ has paid for my sins.

Christ then rose again, in all His glory, to defeat the powers of sin and death and to give me new life. His Holy Spirit resides in me now, breathing His new life into me, dwelling in the new heart He has given me, guiding my life and battling with me against the spiritual war of sin and death that has already been destroyed at the Cross. Isn't it amazing that on the Cross, where the world sees a lump of flesh and bones battered to death, dying in the most humiliating, painful way possible- that is where our God's glory is most powerfully shown. That is where God's salvation plan for us is complete, at Christ's death and Resurrection.

That Christ should do all that for me... it springs a gratitude I cannot convey truly either on this forum or real life. The love of Christ we so quickly for granted, but we are forgetting the one who died for us, who brought us new life. That He loved me so much that despite all my rubbish, human sinfulness, He would die for me on the Cross. That even though I've told Him to shove off... I can keep running back into God's loving arms. I push Christ away in my human weakness... but when I turn back, Christ is there, holding out His arms. I can't wait for the day I see my Lord face to face, that I can truly be with Him, that I will have a new body and won't be in bondage with sin any longer. That I can just spend my days in bliss and joy giving God the glory He deserves. That He, God, died for a sinner, me... THAT is grace.

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found; was blind, but now I see.
 
 
Seldom have I seen a more eloquent description of one's love for Christ; jmj, my hat is off to you.

Aw thanks hehe   Do you know what I mean when grace just hits you? When you actually think about what Christ has done for you, and you think how could God possibly have done that for ME, and then grace- bam. It's amazing, and I nearly cried as I wrote it  
 
 
It's certainly an extremely intense realisation that I'm glad to be able to relate to, yes.  

Incomprehensible in a particularly joyous way. This supreme love that would do something like that for me - it's mindboggling. And challenging.

To be frank, linking to a website with articles by Ray Comfort is one of the most damaging things you can do for your intellectual credibility. I have no doubt that it is horrendously embarrassing for many other Christians on this forum, so please: just don't do it.
 
 
Jesus Christ this forum is weird.

He said the church was on the cloud, not poking through it, so I don't think your objection is valid.

god exists in all of us as the holy spirit, we are a temple for him.
Trust me, atheists dont understand this. We christians have a RELATIONSHIP with god, we feel his presence, thats when u no u r being loved and being cared for.

An amazing testimony, God is so powerful. I never grasped the idea of a relationship with God before I came to university and now I feel unbelievably close to God.

PS- thank you for you rep by the way, it was lovely of you! Just thought I'd mention I'm a girl, so I'm your sister not your brother   But thank you
