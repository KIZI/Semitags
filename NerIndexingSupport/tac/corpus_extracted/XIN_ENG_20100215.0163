A spokeswoman for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in Washington told
Xinhua on Monday night that all five people aboard a small aircraft were killed
after the plane crashed earlier Monday at the Monmouth Executive Airport in the
U.S. state of New Jersey.

Aerial video, broadcast on WCBS-TV in New York, of part of the flattened
wreckage near State Route 34 showed the aircraft completely destroyed.

The airport is located in the town of Wall, about 8 km west of the central
business district of Belmar in Central New Jersey, on the U.S. eastern seaboard.

A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman in Washington said a team was
dispatched to investigate the accident. An investigation was launched involving,
the U.S., New Jersey and Wall Township, NJ, agencies.
