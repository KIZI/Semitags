Speaker of Indonesian parliament Marzuki Ali said Monday his institution will
prioritize legislative tasks as it is scheduled to finish 70 bills this year
whereas it has only completed five bills so far.

Speaking at a parliamentary plenary session, Marzuki said that the parliament
will put focus on two new bills submitted by government.

"We have a bill that should be approved about agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Federation of Russia about military technical cooperation and
a bill of memorandum of understanding between the Republic of Indonesia and
Brunei Kingdom about cooperation in defense sector. Both bills will be handled
by the Commission I," he said.

According to Marzuki, the parliamentary performance has been in a negative
spotlight as they have been considered not at its maximum effort in addressing
legislative issues.

"Therefore, we are agreed to make a breakthrough in addressing the issues,
namely by re-allocating schedule in parliament's sessions and by tightening
deadlines, among others," he said.

He said that the parliament did not only target quantity resulted in line with
priorities, but also maintain quality so that the bills that will become laws
would benefit people, the country and the nation.
