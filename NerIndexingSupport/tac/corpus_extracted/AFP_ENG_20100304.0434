Mali's foreign minister said Bamako hopes to improve relations with Algeria and
Mauritania, in the wake of a row over the release of suspected Al-Qaeda
prisoners in exchange for a French hostage.

Foreign Minister Moctar Ouane, speaking to the diplomatic corps Wednesday, added
that Mali -- often accused of being the weak link in tackling Al-Qaeda in the
sub-Saharan region -- remains committed to fighting terrorism in the Sahel.

"(Mali) will intensify its efforts with a view to preserve its relations,
notable by reinforcing political dialogue between the three countries," said
Ouane.

"The government of Mali remains deeply attached to the secular relations of
fraternity, friendship and good neighbourliness, in particular with the People's
Democratic Republic of Algeria and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania."

Algiers and Nouakchott strongly criticised the release of four Islamist
prisoners held in Mali, two of whom were from Algeria and one from Mauritania.
Both countries recalled their ambassadors to Mali in protest.

The prisoner release had been demanded by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, in
exchange for a French hostage being held in northern Mali where five European
hostages remain after his release.

However, the Mali foreign minister said his government "remained determined to
combat terrorism and cross-border banditry in all its forms."
