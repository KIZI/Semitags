 Barbara Bush: Palin should stay in Alaska - Politics - msnbc.com 

Former first lady Barbara Bush says she hopes Sarah Palin stays in Alaska.

In a preview for a Larry King interview to be shown Monday on CNN, former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, are shown addressing topics such as the Tea Party influence, the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, and their son's book.

Asked for her read on Palin, Barbara Bush responded:

"I sat next to her once, thought she was beautiful and I think she's very happy in Alaska — and I hope she'll stay there."
 
 
The State of Alaska begs to differ
 
 
So does Palin's bank account
 
 
And what Barbara Bush says matters, why?

A whole lot of people which is why she gets interviewed on national TV and you dont.

When asked, Barbara Bush said she is beautiful and loves Alaska. I hope she stays there.  
 
 
Use to learn the fucking 'search' function. Idiot. There's at least 3 threads on this already.

Do less drugs, Junky, they are affecting your intellect - assuming you had an intellect.

I heard that this morning and thought I was hearing things. You can bet you last dollar Sarah will run for President in 2012, now. LOOK OUT GOP! Here she comes!  
 
 
Palin should NOT stay in Alaska.

Palin should run for prez and defeat Barack Husain Osama
 
 
ah yes, what is this now, the 15 thread on this.

and lefties SWEAR they are smart.

yeah sure, I'm all tore up over what Barbara Bush has to say.    
 
 
Meh. Barbara Bush's husband felt the same way about Reagan.
 
 
What Barbara meant was that she thought it was best for Sarah to stay in Alaska then having to go throught the media bias and slander against her and her family like she did in 08.
 
 
 
Meh. Barbara Bush's husband felt the same way about Reagan.

 

 

Yep... it still amazes me that Reagan chose him to be his running mate, and even crazier that Bush won the presidency.
Although he did so on the coat tail of Reagan.

Barabra is a cool old lady, but I cant get behind a statement like that.

Enjoy retirement Barb &  
 
 
 
What Barbara meant was that she thought it was best for Sarah to stay in Alaska then having to go throught the media bias and slander against her and her family like she did in 08.

 

Is that your opinion or is there some way to prove that?

I dont like to guess what someone might've meant b/c I am usually wrong.
 
 
i'm fifty one and i forget things...

"scenery is here, wish you were beautiful..." ben franklin 1745 the first postcard
 
 
 
What Barbara meant was that she thought it was best for Sarah to stay in Alaska then having to go throught the media bias and slander against her and her family like she did in 08.

 

No what Barbara meant is that Palin has no business running for president.
 
 
 
Meh. Barbara Bush's husband felt the same way about Reagan.

 

He was right about that.
 
 
 
When asked, Barbara Bush said she is beautiful and loves Alaska. I hope she stays there.  

 

Alaska wishes she would stay away.......Joe Miller?

Yes, USArmyman, that might be what you would like it to mean, but everyone except those blinded by the dim TV glow of FOX news late into the night, realize that she meant for Sarah to STAY IN ALASKA. But of course she won't.

She will first run for the GOP nomination, and when that is denied she will take up the righteous and noble cause of the Tea Party. allbeit a slightly racist slant on what American should look like.

Thou speaketh the Truth, Barbara...God Bless!
 
 
merged.
 
 
 
And what Barbara Bush says matters, why?

Anyone care? ANYONE

 

.....'Cause,  she was THE whip-cracker  in the Bush -household!!!!

 
"Bush's son told NBC's Matt Lauer that the point of the story was not to show how he came to be pro-life.

"I thought it was very important for people to understand the relationship with my mom," the former president said. "There's no question that it affected me -- my philosophy -- we should respect life."

"The purpose of the story really wasn't to show the evolution of a pro-life point of view, it was really to show how my mom and I developed a relationship."

In the interview broadcast Monday, King pressed Bush on her stance on abortion.

"You had differing opinions, though, on pro-life, did you not?" King asked.

"I don't remember," the former first lady demurred.

Former President George H. W. Bush, who also appeared in the interview, interruppted. "Yes, they did," he admitted.

"  Shh, George ," she said."

 

This was the same President who kept insisting  he WASN'T a wimp .  
 
 
 
Palin should NOT stay in Alaska.

Palin should run for prez and defeat Barack Husain Osama

 

....And, Texas SHOULD be given-back to Mexico....but, that probably won't happen, EITHER!!

 
 
 
 
What Barbara meant was that she thought it was best for Sarah to stay in Alaska then having to go throught the media bias and slander against her and her family like she did in 08.

 

....Primarily, because....she's an ex-pageant-contestant, with the intelligence & curiosity of a tree-stump.

 
 
 
 
 
Meh. Barbara Bush's husband felt the same way about Reagan.

 

 

Yep... it still amazes me that Reagan chose him to be his running mate, and even crazier that Bush won the presidency.
Although he did so on the coat tail of Reagan.

 

Yeah, Skippy.....that's what happened......  

 
"Like most people in Washington, Clinton understood that Ronald Reagan was a figurehead and that it was really the Bush Cabal,  which was running things for all of those 12 years . "

 
 
 
I think Palin should return to Russia

As opposed to Palin, who's proud to head the un-electable wing.

because we care. we're Americans.

Are you kidding. I voted for HW! We need more moderates, instead of you screaming baggers. The stars are lining up for a big Palin victory in the GOP 2012 nomination. The "establishment republicans" will moan, as they should. She will cost them the WH in 2012, and Obama's coat tails will keep the Senate and recover seats in the House. YOU SAW IT HERE FIRST!

Steele won't care. He will be long gone by then. Maybe a Bagger will get his job? Whatcha think?
 
 
 
I think Palin should return to Russia

 

Why not? All she'd have to do is run, hop, and skip a few yards from her front porch and she'd be having lunch with Boris and Natasha

 
 
 
 
A whole lot of people which is why she gets interviewed on national TV and you dont.

 

I assume that you give credibility to EVERYONE who is interviewed on national TV then...

I seriously doubt that. But in this case, it would appear that whatever Mrs. Bush meant by her statement was a plus for the Palin haters, so she gets cudos from the left.... how funny.

If she had said "I hope she runs for President and wins." You idiots would be calling Mrs. Bush a lunatic.

two faced liars and opportunists....AKA the Democrat party
 
 
 
And what Barbara Bush says matters, why?

Anyone care? ANYONE

 

 

Because it takes extraordinary circumstances for Establishment, Country Club Republicans to break Reagan's 11th Commandment.

It's news because it's a Republican breaking from group-think and lockstep agreement, criticizing one of their own.

It would be like if some Rightwinger had the balls to criticize Limbaugh. And I think Barbara Bush did, once.

Looks like she's the only one on the Right who has any balls at all.

They saw Reagan as the frontman/figurehead that he was. Bush 41 had the understanding of policy. Reagan didn't have the capacity. He surrounded himself with people who easily persuaded him, like Casper Weinberger, James Baker, Edwin Meese, George Schultz, and especially Don Regan, of Goldman Sachs, who basically engineered the massive transfer of wealth to the rich, which started under Clueless Ronnie. Even Nancy was alarmed at Regan's influence, and organized his ouster.

What makes Babs Bush not "on the Right"?

I'm quite unhappy with President Obama, and I'd probably vote for just about anyone else, but I will not vote for Sarah Palin. If Sarah Palin gets the nomination, I'd probably have no choice but to hold my nose and vote for Obama again, which I do not want to do.

BTW who are all the drunk people who think Sarah Palin is pretty?

Barbra Bush should learn how to suck dick. Babs Bush is just a wife who dont know her ass from a whole in the ground. It is a tragedy that our choice was Al Gore of Bush, same goes for the choice between Clinton and Bush.

Transfer or wealth, another Marxist, how many of you are posting on USMB.

Liberals have had every chance in the world to make the USA great for everybody, why have they failed, such great ideas, how could they fail simply because an idiot such as Bush is elected. I moron, an idiot, a liar, easily seen through by the Liberals, so how is it Bush undid the great, strong economy that Clinton created, Clinton had a surplus, why was that wealth not transferred to the poor.

Why was the Clinton surplus not transferred to the poor.

It is because everything the Liberal states is a lie.

All the jobs and wealth created by Liberals such as Clinton is a "paper-tiger-economy", a "house of cards".

How about Carter who gave us the mess in the Middle East and now Carter and Clinton are directly responsible for the deaths of South Koreans. Carter and Clinton failed the Korean people.

Liberals and the lies.

Watch the response, guaranteed to be filled with vile and hate, by the same people who gave us riots in Berkeley these last couple weeks because they have to pay 800 bucks more for their tuition, Berkeley, a college for rich Liberals, the students riot, and beat the police sending many to the hospital. Rich Liberal's children violently attack police over 800 bucks.

Liberals are liars, hate filled bigots.

Congress controls the money, braniac. The Congress was controlled by Republicans from 1994 until 2006, which includes the transition from Clinton to Bush.

So why didn't the Republicans in charge return the surplus to the people? I thought they were the " it's YOUR money, not the government's " crowd?

Hey! She's gonna be our next Commander In Chief, Gunny!    

All the cable news shows say so. Even one of the most Liberal columnists agrees:

Reagan brilliantly cash cropped Nixon's "silent majority" aka the white protestant belly of America. Ronnie was the Great American Cowboy, come to take America back from the atheists, hippies, and policy-elites, who were destroying a great nation with bra burning, dope smoking, free love, and welfare. He was sick of hearing complaints about our treatment of the Indians or Vietnamese, sick of those who would apologize for America's benevolent power; sick of seeing the Left attack the nuclear family; sick of seeing our cities turn into welfare slums, filled with drug dealers, crime, homosexuals, and festering ghettos. Ronnie rode in on his horse and he said: "I want my country back"

You have to credit Reagan. He was able to merge the libertarians, looking for tax cuts and less government, with the Evangelicals, looking to put Pat Robertson's Greasy hands all over America's art, schools, wombs, and souls. Only a Machiavellian evil-genius could combine such opposing camps. Reagan's charisma solidified a money machine which would spawn an industry of think tanks, publishing groups, political action committees, and lobyists... all of which would combined to move corporate money into government & media more effectively than any other political movement in history.

People don't understand Reagan's wizardry. He started as an FDR loving Hollywood elitist who not only passed California's most liberal abortion policy but never set foot in a church. He stumped hard for Truman before his eventual political rebirth on the Goldwater campaign -- "A Time For Choosing". By the 70s he had transformed himself into a religious Conservative in order to steal the heartland from the Liberals, who sold FDR's working man down river in exchange for welfare queens and black panthers. He opened his campaign for president in Philadelphia Mississippi, telling white folk -- who were disgusted by the Civil Rights Movement -- that he was gonna get the fed off their backs.

You'd think that the Conservative base -- who pride themselves on political skepticism -- would have seen-through Reagan's highly choreographed, transparent metamorphosis into a religious savior. Nope. The Conservative base tends to turn their political leaders into God-like figures. Don't take my word for it. Use your Google. Their love for Reagan and Palin is all the evidence you will ever need.

Reagan seized white backlash better than any president before him. He moved populist anger from corporations to government. Palin is trying to co-opt the same white resentment, but she lacks Reagan's skill.
 
 
 
 
 
They saw Reagan as the frontman/figurehead that he was. Bush 41 had the understanding of policy. Reagan didn't have the capacity. He surrounded himself with people who easily persuaded him, like Casper Weinberger, James Baker, Edwin Meese, George Schultz, and especially Don Regan, of Goldman Sachs, who basically engineered the massive transfer of wealth to the rich, which started under Clueless Ronnie. Even Nancy was alarmed at Regan's influence, and organized his ouster.

What makes Babs Bush not "on the Right"?

 

Barbra Bush should learn how to suck dick. Babs Bush is just a wife who dont know her ass from a whole in the ground. It is a tragedy that our choice was Al Gore of Bush, same goes for the choice between Clinton and Bush.

 

She's not entitled to speak her mind?

 
Transfer or wealth, another Marxist, how many of you are posting on USMB.

Liberals have had every chance in the world to make the USA great for everybody, why have they failed, such great ideas, how could they fail simply because an idiot such as Bush is elected. I moron, an idiot, a liar, easily seen through by the Liberals, so how is it Bush undid the great, strong economy that Clinton created, Clinton had a surplus, why was that wealth not transferred to the poor.

Why was the Clinton surplus not transferred to the poor.

It is because everything the Liberal states is a lie.

All the jobs and wealth created by Liberals such as Clinton is a "paper-tiger-economy", a "house of cards".

How about Carter who gave us the mess in the Middle East and now Carter and Clinton are directly responsible for the deaths of South Koreans. Carter and Clinton failed the Korean people.

Liberals and the lies.

Watch the response, guaranteed to be filled with vile and hate, by the same people who gave us riots in Berkeley these last couple weeks because they have to pay 800 bucks more for their tuition, Berkeley, a college for rich Liberals, the students riot, and beat the police sending many to the hospital. Rich Liberal's children violently attack police over 800 bucks.

Liberals are liars, hate filled bigots.

 

Congress controls the money, braniac. The Congress was controlled by Republicans from 1994 until 2006, which includes the transition from Clinton to Bush.

So why didn't the Republicans in charge return the surplus to the people? I thought they were the " it's YOUR money, not the government's " crowd?

 

No, Bush cannot speak her mind,

No endless filibusterer during that time, whats wrong, selective memory. There is much more but I am too busy in other threads to start another debate. I may come back to this though.

I dont support Republicans, further the Bush tax cut did return the money, partially.

One quick observation, Republicans did not control Congress in 1994, dumb-ass.

and another item I forgot, Senator Jeffords.

I am not happy that Republicans won, this is a bit old, I dont agree with a third party but this quote is spot on.

I say shit about Barbra Bush, then Clinton, and someone thinks I am partisan Republican, what a "Brainiac"

 
 What Republican Revolution? by Laurence M. Vance 

 

 
Those who voted for a third party candidate for Congress in the recent election are not the ones who wasted their vote. Republicans who voted for Republican candidates hoping that “this time” perhaps the performance of the Republicans might improve are the ones who wasted their vote. Conservatives who, against their better judgment, voted Republican because they feared what would happen if the “liberals” were in control, wasted their vote on a party that deserved to lose. Evangelical Christians who held their nose and voted Republican because they thought they were choosing the lesser of two evils not only wasted their vote, but are sadly mistaken

WHAT?!?

Oh, I get it - you're trying to be clever, since the election was in 1994, but they took office in 1995. Ooh, you're a smart one!

OK - adjust the years: they controlled Congress from 1995-2007. Better? What fucking difference does it make to the fact that they were in charge of the money when we had the surplus?
 
 
 
 
Bush 41: One of the most evil people that ever sat in the Oval Office

 

You can't fault Bush for the sins of his son. At least, not all of them.

 

....Especially when all his sons were  so $ucce$$ful , in Life....or, at the very -least.... maintained  the good-name o' BU$H  !!!!
 
 
 
 
 
....Primarily, because....she's an ex-pageant-contestant, with the intelligence & curiosity of a tree-stump.

 

 

... who refuses to show her high school diploma.

 

Apparently you don't need such things

 

.....Especially when you're Republican, and White!!
 
 
 
 Barbara Bush: Palin should stay in Alaska - Politics - msnbc.com 

Former first lady Barbara Bush says she hopes Sarah Palin stays in Alaska.

In a preview for a Larry King interview to be shown Monday on CNN, former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, are shown addressing topics such as the Tea Party influence, the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, and their son's book.

Asked for her read on Palin, Barbara Bush responded:

"I sat next to her once, thought she was beautiful and I think she's very happy in Alaska  and I hope she'll stay there."

 

Ain't it grand that BB ain't the boss of anybody?      
 
 
 
 
 
The Bushes could not stand the Reagans either, moron.

Barbara Bush is not on the right.

What makes Babs Bush not "on the Right"?

 

Bush 41 should have surrounded himself with people that could get him re-elected.

 

Yeah....that's what he had.....  a staffing-problem .....

I'm quite unhappy with President Obama, and I'd probably vote for just about anyone else, but I will not vote for Sarah Palin. If Sarah Palin gets the nomination, I'd probably have no choice but to hold my nose and vote for Obama again, which I do not want to do.

BTW who are all the drunk people who think Sarah Palin is pretty?
