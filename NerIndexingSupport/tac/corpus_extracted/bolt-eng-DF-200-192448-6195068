 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8603591.stm 

So the election will be announced tomorrow morning, to be held on 6th May as expected.

How will you be voting? I realise there are numerous polls in existence but I wanted to know the latest outlook.

If you'd like information about the policies of each of the main parties, there's a comparison here.

I am undecided as to whether to vote for the best party on the market (Liberal Democrats) or to vote for the party who will keep out the god awful David Cameron (ie. Labour).

Vote for a party I actually want in power, or vote for the lesser of two evilss. Tricky decision.

I won't be

- My constituency is either going to be labour or BNP, so anything else will be a wasted vote anyway.

I'm voting lib.dems.... because the leader has a wife who keeps out of politics because she ISN'T a politician and I think that's good of her. The lib dems are the only party who aren't wasting tonnes of money of campaigns.... and they aren't changing their "promises" every bloody speech, unlike labour AND conservs. Also... lib dems, regardless if they'll get into office or not, will likely have the most seats in parliament anyway so decisions will have to be made with them no matter what. YAY!
 
 
Never voted,never will

  But surely if your constituency has a strong chance of going BNP, every vote against them counts!
 
 
I won't be.
 
 
I vote through my parents...ie. I tell them who to vote for  

its got to be Lib Dem though....and labour....seeing as I get 2 votes...and I hate the tories (dave and georgie anyway)

I'd be voting Lib Dem if I was just a few months older. I kinda feel robbed of my right to vote. There are morons in this town with the right to vote, and many wont choose to do so.
Labour -in for too long
Tories -a blue version of labour, only more incompetent
Lib Dems - speak sense, but wont get in (hung parliament though? Either ruin the country, or give the sensible people a voice?)
UKIP -like the BNP, only they can use English properly
BNP -thugs
Greens -good environmental policies, but nothing else
OMRLP -a true representation of the British stiff upper lip!

What are people's views on actually exercising their right to vote? Personally, it's important to me. I am of Polish extraction, and in communist Poland there were blood relatives of mine who had no such right. It always makes me angry to hear people who aren't bothered by it. Other people's thoughts?
 
 
I hope people don't vote  Labservative .

Not really, whether or not I vote 'against' them wouldn't really matter as I was never going to vote for them, and as it is a strong labour seat the obvious party to vote for tactically would be labour but that isn't going to happen so, until we work out something other than FPTP, I probably won't vote until I live in a better constituency.

Read above
 
 
If I could I'd vote for TUSC (Trade Union and Socialist Coalition) - but as there not standing in my area it may have to be Labour to keep the Tories out (not that I think there'll be a difference but I couldn't stand Cameron's smug smile if he wins). I used to think Lib Dems were ok but now they show there true colours by announcing 'savage cuts' 'worse than Margaret Thatcher'. People who think they are different to the other 2 must be watching through a microscope.

Completely agree with you sir  . The right to vote was, for most people, hard won so we shouldn't waste it.

Labour. Simply because every vote for them is another vote to get us a hung parliament. Best case scenario atm.
 
 
For those planning to vote Labour - are you doing so as a means of voting against the Tories, or because you genuinely want to see another 5 years of Labour government? Ideologically, I'd vote Labour just behind Lib Dems, but no way would I consider voting for them in this election on the basis that I imagine Gordon Brown will only resign as leader if his party is defeated in it. And right now, although I have respect for him in some ways, I could never vote Gordon Brown into another position of leadership.

You think a hung parliament would be the best scenario?

Personally I think it would be the most damaging outcome, particularly at a time when we need parliament to be making tough decisions to cut the deficit.

Weak government is the last thing we need.
 
 
Surprised to see that (as I'm posting this), after 36 votes, over 40% will be voting Lib Dems.

I'd be interested to see how TSR opinion polls compare with for example, The Guardian's.
 
 
Lib dem, but need to have a sit down and have a look at policies really

however am slightly concerned, ive not had anything through the door about registering to vote where I am as a student, and dunno whether i'm registered back home..am a bit concerned i won't be able to vote as its too late

I'm 50/50 atm between lib dem and labour (well maybe 60/40 lib dem) and you know what, yeah its tactical voting against the tories...but also, I've been comfortable with the labour government, after growing up with them and the chanegs they made in education and how it helped me, and then changes in nursing they're doing now- aswell as issues i agree with, I wouldn't complain if labour stayed in power. I do however think this country DOES need a change now, something new and refreshing. I felt so jealous when america got obama, it felt so much like hope and i think this country needs that, a shake up, and i fear the tories will bring the country down a bad road, but the lib dems (as weak of a party they are and will never get in!) can offer that

You'll probably be registered in your home constituency but as a student you're able to choose where you vote.

If you go onto the council website for your university constituency, there should be a voter registration form which you can fill in and post to them.

Enjoy x
 
 
oooh very encouraged to see the Lib dems take the lead!

You shouldve had more other e.g

Why are the Liberals so popular on TSR ?

is it because people on TSR are Young ? or coz mainly Graduates or Wannabe Graduates ?

there must be a reason, coz in real life liberal are at like 19%

yeah but isn't there an annual canvas? I never got the form, ive been here over a year...and knowing my parents they probably said i didn't live there anymore (even tho its my offical home address..i dont even have my own bedroom anymore).

I'll do the form tomorrow but i fear it's far too late for me  
If it's ok then im gonna have to risk doing the postal vote!

Either the UKIP or the UK Pirate Party.

Any vote is a wasted vote in a hung government, so I urge you to detract from the big three and choose better, smaller parties.

Plus the amount of interest voters share in the UK Pirate Party will be reflected in the real government in what laws they set about copyright, piracy, and privacy online in general.

Actually I'm swaying more toward the pirates because their cause will have the most impact on the UK than the UKIP will (too many people are deluded with the EU being the best thing since toasted sliced bread with the perfect amount of butter spread evenly across the surface topped with the finest jam along with a cup of tea made with freshly boiled water with the green tea leaves left to soak for exactly 2 minutes).

As far as I know, they just need to receive your registration form within 11 days of the election.

So you should be on time if you post it sharpish

oh lol yea thats probably it ? but surely people base their opinion or more than 1 thing ? and youd be suprised UKIP did better came 2nd in EU elections

and SNP will probably win 90% of Scotish Seats
 
 
Currently debating between Labour and our incumbent independent MP. I'd ideally like to see the Lib Dems win, but they don't stand a chance in this seat. In short, anyone but the tories.
 
 
none of your buisness tbh
 
 
Lib Dems but I hate their social ideology so probably Conservative.
 
 
I might as well not vote, the conservatives have never lost in my constituency anyway.
 
 
i will be voting for Lib Dem and Green Party.

Lib Dem. I agree with most of their policies, and don't agree with tactical voting; I vote for who I want to win.
 
 
im voooooootin tories becoz grdn bwown iz stoopid, and evrifing iz his fault i hav no idea what a policy iz but david kamrun has da same colur hair as me so i finkz i wil votez for him
 
 
I like how the poll colours match the colours of the parties.
 
 
Lib Dems. I wouldn't ever vote Tory or Labour.
 
 
 
Originally Posted by Phobia27

Obviously intentional  
 
 
It depends where. In my uni constituency, Lib Dem/Tory. At home, UKIP/Tory.
 
 
Definitely voting in Holborn and St Pancras for Frank Dobson (Labour). Would be a wasted vote in my folks' constituency (NW Norfolk) because the lovely Tory Henry Bellingham is expected to keep a tight grip on the area.
 
 
Plaid Cymru. Though it's a long shot considering my MP has one of the largest Labour majorities in the Commons (and probably one of the safest Labour seats in history, having never fallen out of Labour hands since its inception in the very-late 1800s). One can hope though.
 
 
Why is it that the Lib Dems and their silly party with polytechnic sociology lecturer values always do so well on polls on this forum?

What do they actually stand for? Nothing. Except maybe "being nice" (which usually turns out to be not being very nice the the majority) and not upsetting any delicate souls... maybe that's why they do so well on here.

They are chameleons, they stand precisely for whatever the dominant party in their electoral ward do not stand for.
 
 
Ukip
 
 
My local Labour MP has an (undeserved IMHO) 20,000+ majority, so a tactical vote for the Lib Dems (in order to get Labour out) is pointless. I'll be voting Conservative.

They won't compare. Student's vote based on ideologies which they soon realise when they're older are impossible, and begin to moreso vote with their gut.

You would expect to see a very left overall trend on a student forum.
 
 
where is BNP.. I don't wanna cast my vote on 'others'
 
 
Conservatives. Mainly because of their school choice policy, which is probably the only Tory policy that is significantly different to Labour. If the Tories do win, I'll have a good laugh over all the people (generally students) who seem to have such a large emotional investment in seeing the Tories lose.
 
 
SNP.

And that won't change.

I get to vote against the Prime Minister. What an honour.
 
 
At the moment, will be voting for the Lib Dems or Greens, probably the Lib Dems. Nothing is set in stone.

However, Cameron's speech was good. Very good. It could be an election winner. It even made me consider voting for him...
 
 
 
 
 
I'm voting lib dem, but mainly because I want the conservatives to win. For where I live the last election was something like this:

Lab ~33,000
Lib ~29,000
Con ~6,000

So the conservatives really have no chance, and every vote for the lib dems in my constituency is a vote which might lose labour a seat  
 
 
Liberal Democrats- at the point of this post the Liberals are winning the thread poll- I'am surprised!
 
 
Labour, i like gordon brown and would love to see him in for another 4 years and labourto turn it around.

All those who are saying anythin but conservative dont waste your vote on the lib dems vote labour!!!

Gordon brown v david cameron i know who i would prefer to be leading the country!!

Nah not if you like the lib dems and what they stand for, rather than New Labour.
 
 
liberizzles
 
 
I will be voting probably Lib Dem...Funny thing was I was watching the speak by Conservative Speak this morning and did anyone else notice how he said he was their for the people - but yet his whole audience were suited snobs from the elite!
 
 
This is why young people shouldn't be allowed to vote. I mean, why the feck are Labour only third in the poll? T

hose of you who haven't voted Labour need to wake up. The Lib Dems won't be gettig into power. Vote them and you are puttig your vote behid the filthy, racist and homophobic Tories.
 
 
Lib Dems will undoubtedly win in my Uni constituency (Nick Clegg lolz) so I'm going to vote at home. Labour currently hold a strong majority but hopefully that will change...
 
 
Lib Dem. I don't like my local Labour candidate and as a socialist I'm hardly likely to vote tory. Greens aren't running in my area so I can't vote for them.

If we don't vote for what we believe in, why vote at all?

This is the most important election for a generation, perhaps two. It comes at the head of a critical point in British history which will redefine our role for the next half of the century. It is right and important that people vote for what they believe in, rather than who you say they should vote for. Labour has destroyed it's chances at this election, and IMHO the left vote should throw their lot in with the far more sensible Liberal Democrats if they want to see change come to this country.

How will the country go further into recession/depression. The fact you use depression probably shows you know nothing about what exactly is and occurs in a modern economy. But please explain how this will occur.

I'll be voting Conservative thanks. David will fix things.  
 
 
Just saw this on youtube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=?v=QZRXJ_KX768 

Made me laugh  
 
 
I just saw on the bbc website that I live in 1 of the 3 out of 18 consituencies in Essex that doesn't have a BNP candidate

I'm moving counties if any of the 15 constituencies put a BNP member into parliament  
 
 
I really don't know what to do,
like somebody else said, for me it's between Labour and the BNP....and though it would make sense to keep Margaret Hodge's seat against Nick blooming Griffin, I hate Margaret Hodge  
 
 
UKIP all the way. LabCon are inbecilic disasters. Liberal Democrats are time wasters
 
 
I'm reasonably undecided, but leaning towards conservative, if not them than labour.

The main issue being how much tax am I likely to have to pay over the course of my career.
 
 
Conservative. Labour don't deserve another 5years.
 
 
Ukip
 
 
Conservative...

Labour...well don't even get me started on their record in office

Lib Dems...more left wing than Labour and have no credible policies because they know they'll never have to implement them (they aren't going to win power)

And before you say..but look at the poll...think...this is a STUDENT website...of course there are going to be loads of people voting Lib Dem.
 
 
don't you mean 'who' will you be voting for? How? In person or online.

Students are generally quite left wing.

Simply because Brown thinks by solving a recession adding tax and more tax to tax will solve everything, he simply doesn't know how to get the country out of it and whatever he does only makes it worse. I said depression because of the fact the country feels like it is, so many people are unemployed cause there are no jobs and not enough businesses left to actually employ people.
 
 
Tory.
 
 
conservatives as will my mummy and daddy
x
 
 
My constituency has been conservative since 1924 with the current closest rivals being the Lib Dems. Its a 48% - 27% split between the two... what are the chances of a 21% swing to the Lib Dems? I therefore see little point in voting

Where have you got this idea there wont be tax increases under conservatives, all parties will increase taxes no matter what. The tories want to cut spending drastically which is in itself could destroy any chance of recovery. Just look at the economy now, its improving. I don't think anyone can say that what the government hasn't done reasonably in keeping the recession under control, yes there's unemployment but obviously its not going to sort itself out over night.
 
 
Conservatives. No doubt. Labour are bad for this country. Taxes have massively increased, inflation has increased (public sector inflation is at one of its highest levels in decades), unemployment has increased, Britain is no longer competitive in the global economy... We are, without question, the laughing stock of Europe.

VOTE CONSERVATIVE.  
 
 
I haven't a clue right now. I may vote UKIP but they just seem way too Daily Mail-esque at the moment with their rhetoric. I may vote Liberal Democrat or Green because if I'm going to waste a vote I may as well waste it on someone who I like (in terms of their local candidates). I may vote Conservative but then I probably won't seeing as my local candidate is a bit of slimeball. I won't be voting Labour because I disagree fundamentally with almost everything they stand for.

I live in a straight Labour/Tory marginal (albeit with some interesting action on the UKIP/BNP wing of things) so it doesn't really matter who I vote for if it isn't Labour or the Conservatives.

It is quite disappointing, actually. I remember someone telling me once that UKIP were a rather libertarian party, but that it is clearly not true.
 
 
What do BNP mean by give preference in the job market to "native Britons" ?

The amount of people I've encountered who share this attitude just proves how broken the system is. We're definitely in need of a reform.
 
 
I can't vote but I would vote conservative if I could. As long as labour is out I'm happy and lets face it the lib dems are never getting in.

Well, they are generally true..
 
 
you need a abstain option dude
 
 
I hate it when people say 'Oh I can't be bothered to vote'.   I'm too young to vote at this election but maaann I'd love to be able to.
 
 
Student forum: mostly Lib Dem votes... how surprising.  
 
 
TORY cos brown kinda sucks and voting liberal is a waste of time as not enough 'grown ups' vote for them any way to have any actual power
 
 
Majority Lib Dem? Seriously ?
 
 
Tory, because they're just generally the most awesome party.  
 
 
Lol. Doesn't matter. tories will win anyway

Exactly. I am a libertarian and I'm a Eurosceptic so I thought UKIP would be a good choice but as it gets closer to the elections they are being waaay too socially moralist and generally stupid for my tastes.

They want to stop UK companies being taken over by foreign multi-nationals which totally goes against free-market economics, they want a flat 31% tax which is just impractical and totally anti-pragmatic. And, most Daily Mail-tastic of all, they want to ban the Niqab and Burka, scrap "political correctness" (whatever the feck that is?). Also one of their main policy points is "Fishing" which seems like an odd choice.

I'd love to give UKIP a kick up the backside, I wish there was a sensible libertarian party.
 
 
Conservative, I'll be voting through my sister.
 
 
I'll be voting Labour because
A) Cameron sucks dick.
B) The Lib Dems will never get into power. Ever.
C) Very little of the problems that face us are the Labour governments doing. They are our own doing, and we just look for people higher up to blame. We are a stupid species.

I live in a straight Labour/Tory marginal (albeit with some interesting action on the UKIP/BNP wing of things) so it doesn't really matter who I vote for if it isn't Labour or the Conservatives.

 

Christ that's a clattering bag of contradictions. You want to vote UKIP or Lib Dem..the parties most opposed to each other on the (rather large) issue of Europe. You fundamentally disagree with Labour yet consider the Greens...whose policies are very socialist and quite Old Labour. You may vote for the tories and you don't see their rhetoric as Daily Mail esque?

Actually, the flat-tax is a rather interesting (and quite valid) idea. As are their policies on banning the Niqab/Burka, and scrapping political correctness.

Finally, have you then considered the LPUK for a libertarian alternative?

God yeah, I know, I'm terrible. I'd vote for pretty much any party, that's just how all over the place my politics is right now. I like the Greens, they're a good party with good people and they deserve an MP, I don't agree with their economic policies but some of their social policies make sense.

Basically I'd vote Lib Dem or Green on social issues, I'd vote UKIP because of their views on international politics and I'd vote Conservatives because of their economic policies.

Chirst only knows who I'm going to vote for. I may just decide on May 6th.

If I lived in Devizes I'd probably vote LPUK, as it is I don't. If they stood in more than one ruddy constituency or maybe 2 or however many it is I may be more interested in what they have to say.

The banning of the burka/niqab doesn't get me that much, but, like you said, their populist anti-globalisation, anti-'PC' gibberish is way too off-putting. Not to mention, of course, the lamentable track record of the two UKIP Lords on gay rights.

They are basically a more right-wing version of the Tories lol

So many people vote Labour or Conservative because it's felt that only one of those two parties can win an election. It would be good to see a facebook campaign for the Liberal Democrats, so people can actually see how many people would vote for them. Perhaps then they would get more seats?

The lib dems would need to gain upwards of 250 seats though to win this election.

After seeing the dissection of the seats and what needs to be won. A tory win will be difficult for sure.

I would be surprised if they won, but I'm sure many different campaigns would improve their position.

Really? I saw the most optimistic as 11% and the most pessimistic as 6%.

6.9% swing against Labour: This is the uniform national swing needed for the Conservatives to gain an overall majority and therefore form the next government. It would also be largest swing for Conservatives since World War II.
 

Although that is just a swing from Labour to Conservative... I agree

I'd vote Lib dem but Nick clegg annoys me so much, he doesn't have a face of a leader, but I like Vince Cable so its between Lib Dems and Labour

He does seem to have a forgettable face, but he has better personality than other recent lib dem leaders.

It's imaginary. Teachers are still allowed to say blackboards and whiteboards, my cousin goes to an incredibly multi-cultural nursery and still sings "Ba Ba Black Sheep". It's all utter tosh invented by the papers to anger their readers and sell more. Yes, there's some pettiness and bureaucracy that's irritating but show me a nation with a totally efficient and always correct system of government.

Political correctness is bullplop. Simple as. It's like the War on Terror, you can't fight a war on an inanimate, nondescript concept, it's even worse than the War on Terror because Political Correctness has killed precisely no-one, it threatens nothing and it's invented by the right-wing press and idiots such as yourself who swallow it.

Yes, yes they are. Just because some idiot advised them against it or they heard a rumor about it being banned it doesn't make it true. No government in their right mind would ban someone from saying a "blackboard". It's all utter rubbish.
 
 
Fingers crossed lib dems.
But realisticly, it will be torys.

Lib Dems...
 
 
I voted Liberal, but there's always a chance I could defect to Greens at the last moment.

Vote for a party I actually want in power, or vote for the lesser of two evilss. Tricky decision.

 

What constituency do you live in?
 
 
I'm actually really relieved to see how many people have chosen Lib Dem. They're the most stable party, and they're who I'm going to be voting for.

I just wish people would stop claiming they're a wasted vote. They're not if people who don't vote for them because they're a wasted vote happen to vote for them! And the lack of media attention sucks too. Just because they're not doing anything outrageous. Oh well. Hopefully we're in with a chance this time.

And I agree that a Facebook campaign might be useful for them, but I couldn't start it because I have a lot of friends who don't care and it'll end up a bit of an anticlimax.
 
 
I'm amazed (but slightly happy!) that Lib Dems were the most popular, I feared it'd be Conservative. I'd vote Labour personally (were I old enough) but Lib Dems are still perefctly fine for me and it does show that our generation is very forward thinking and, well... liberal in comparism to our parents generation  
 
 
I shall be voting Labour, the party that led us out of recession. And at a faster rate than many other countries according to the new figures:
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8606499.stm 

The choice was inaction or bold action. The Tories wanted the former and Labour proved that the latter was the right course. So I know who I trust with the economy.

Well, despite being considered an adult in this country (Scotland) I'm not able to vote. But if I could, it would be Liberal Democrats  

 

I just got negged for that because A vote for selling out England to Brussels is a vote for a big fat neg apparently!

Well, I'd like to point out that the General Election is for Britain not just England. And the EU is not about being sold the Brussels, it's about joining together with them and many other countries!
 
 
Conservatives. They haven't had a Labour MP elected in my constituency since 1945, so I doubt my vote will matter ^^.

firstly - i dont neg. i dont care about red squares, im not a faggot. nor am i stupid enough to think england and britain are interchangable, though it must be said that "selling britain out" would involve "selling england out" - ergo that isnt such a stupid comment as you make out.
secondly - lib dems want total political integration with europe - i cba writing an essay on why this is economically and socially bad for us, but i may well do so later when i finish working.

I didn't think it was you, I don't really care, I just wanted to point out how ridiculous the general Europhobia exhibited in this country is.

And if you think Lib Dems was total political integration with Europe, you don't seem to know what that actually means. They want international co-operations, which is a totally different thing. A presence in Europe gives the UK a better standing globally ( safety in numbers, if you will). It also allows up to be part of a more diverse culture than ever - for example, the EU has 23 official languages and more than 200 non-official ones. Europe is home to so much art, music and literature, and to delve further into the EU is to delve further into this.

i dont have time, so il write in note form.
currency & police force = ultimate expressions of sovereignity.
eu = beurocratic, unaccountable
lisbon = no referendum
e.g. switzerland = fine alternative
independance of nuclear deterrant/ armed forces
issues made worse being dealt with at euro level = CAP
euro = greece owned
unlimited, unmeasured immigration = bad for economy, bad for standard of living, bad for culture and life in general

...even the parts I could decipher made no practical sense.

Maybe if you backed you Europhobia with evidence or sensical arguments I could explain why I disagreed, but until then...
 
 
Liberal Democrats if they get some balls and serious momentum, or BNP, or Conservatives.

my post contained no complicated concepts.
e.g. my third or so bullet point said eu = unaccountable... nothing complicated, the comission is unaccountable to the electorate.

tbh this guy says most of what i want to.

Actually the point I was making is that you came off as utterly illiterate, and that it was a mess of random works and symbols  
 
 
School keeps telling us everyone will be watching Barking.
Considering the amount of people who can't be asked to vote, I'm scared BNP will be voted in.

Oh. I'm voting Lib Dem.

may i direct you to the first line of my post, where i said "i will be posting in note form as i dont have time"?
 
 
I'm thinking Lib Dem atm. I like their policies the best, Labour is a fail and the Conservatives just seem so smarmy and false.
 
 
I can't understand how David Cameron can claim to stand for Green issues and care about the environment when he is jetting around the country! At least Brown and Clegg are using trains or coaches.

Actually I'm swaying more toward the pirates because their cause will have the most impact on the UK than the UKIP will (too many people are deluded with the EU being the best thing since toasted sliced bread with the perfect amount of butter spread evenly across the surface topped with the finest jam along with a cup of tea made with freshly boiled water with the green tea leaves left to soak for exactly 2 minutes).

 

Good Man! If there was a candidate in my area I'd vote PPUK, but there isn't but the DEB has to be stopped, so I Urge anyone who can Vote PPUK!

Unfortunately I probably won't know them! Did however meet a person who goes to Bromsgrove because I sat next to her on a plane journey... weird stuff.
