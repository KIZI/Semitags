For many years, Andy Stack, as he was known to
his classmates at the Milton Hershey School, was among "the
lost."

"We don't know where they are, and we don't have a forwarding
address for them," said Mike Macchioni, the alumnus representative
for the class of 1974 of the famed Pennsylvania orphanage.

And then, one day, maybe 10 years ago, Macchioni tracked Stack
down in California.

"Among the lost, you don't know what to expect," he said.
"Maybe not everyone had a positive experience. But he had people
closer than sisters and brothers here."

Macchioni's conversation with Stack was brief. "He wasn't rude
to me at all, but he was very matter-of-fact. He said something
tantamount to, 'I have nothing against you personally; I just want
nothing to do with the Milton Hershey School or anyone having to do
with the Milton Hershey School.' That's different from a lot of
us."

That seemed to be a pattern with Stack, who went from
Pennsylvania to California to Austin, leaving behind businesses and
family -- he had an ex-wife in California and hadn't spoken to at
least one brother for 15 years. He was, in short, the sort of man
who makes sure to pull the door shut quietly behind him.

Until the day last month when Andrew Joseph Stack III slammed it
emphatically, crashing his plane into the offices of the Internal
Revenue Service in Northwest Austin, killing a man and taking his
own life in the crush of steel, glass and fire.

'A tenacious individual'

Milton and Kitty Hershey, rich from the chocolate business but
childless, started their orphanage in 1909. Graduates were given
$100, a suitcase full of new clothes and a kit of machine tools to
prepare them for a job -- part of the mission to send children to
"fulfilling and productive lives."

Stack was what they called a lifer. His father, who hailed from
Pittsburgh, had died of a heart attack in 1962 in Colorado, where
he worked as a pipe fitter and where all the Stack children were
born -- Andrea first, then Andy, Samantha, Harry and Tom, the
youngest, according to Harry Stack.

"I'm sure that I inherited the fascination for creative
problem-solving from my father," Stack wrote in the long suicide
note he posted online. "I realized this at a very young age."

Soon, their mother moved the family to Johnstown, in western
Pennsylvania, where she grew up. In August 1964, Andy, then 7 years
old, and Harry, then 5, were placed in the all-boys Milton Hershey
boarding school, 150 miles to the east. (Tom was not old enough for
the orphanage.) Several months later, according to Harry Stack,
their mother killed herself with a gun.

The two girls and the youngest boy were split up among
relatives. Some holidays were spent together, and the boys hung out
now and then in their free time. But largely because they were in
different grades and because, Harry said, the school administration
chose to keep them separate, they did not depend on each other on
campus.

"We were in close proximity, but separate," said Harry Stack.
"We didn't grow up in an atmosphere that fostered contact. Nobody
said, 'You guys are brothers; it's important you two especially try
to have some shared experiences' -- the kinds of things that bond
siblings together their entire life."

Parts of the school were rough-and-tumble with kids from broken
homes. Some had parents who committed suicide. Some were street
kids, whose bullet wounds you could see in the showers, said Jim
Allison, a classmate and school friend of Joe Stack's who lived in
the same student house with him for more than a year.

"To a certain degree, some of those kids came in already
emotionally scarred," Allison said. "For some of them, it was the
last step before reform school."

But that wasn't the case with Andy Stack. He was always near the
top of his class; he was in glee club, played the clarinet and was
in the band and orchestra. As the counterculture movement swept
through Hershey and the rest of the country, Stack toed the line.

"He was probably one of the more conservative people in
class," said Allison, who sang with him in glee club. "I don't
remember him doing drugs, don't remember him fighting the system,
don't remember him being rebellious. He was a pretty strait-laced
guy."

"To the general population, he would have been introverted,"
Macchioni said. "I remember a very acerbic wit. He struck me as
being very funny."

Despite his extracurricular activities, Andy Stack wasn't
particularly attached to the school, his brother said.

"We didn't perceive the environment we grew up as nurturing,"
said Harry Stack, who now lives in Ohio. "Many other people saw it
as a great place to grow up. It was a safe place, and every
material want was certainly met.

"Someone spoke about the place as being a warehouse, where you
were out of the rain, well-fed, but we had the sense there were
people with fewer material goods, but they had adults, caregivers,
around them, who interacted with them on a little more of a caring
level and, perhaps, even more of a loving level."

Andy tended to be dedicated, even "fixated" on his own
activities, according to Harry. Long after lights were turned out
in the boys' rooms, he would strum a guitar in the dark as he tried
to improve his playing.

"He could get stuck on something even then. He was a tenacious
individual," Harry Stack said.

"When people raise their kids, they relate their interests and
their passions, even, hope their kids follow those passions,"
continued his brother, who has children of his own. "He developed
the passions he cared about in a sort of vacuum."

'Paddling furiously'

Upon leaving Milton Hershey, with suitcase in hand, Andy Stack
enrolled in Harrisburg Community College in Pennsylvania. He was a
small man -- maybe 5 feet 6 inches, with a lazy eye -- and
introduced himself for the first time as Joe.

"I ran into him there," Allison said. "But he cut himself off
from everybody. Then I never saw him again."

Without graduating, he left Harrisburg, where he survived on
peanut butter and bread "or Ritz crackers when I could afford to
splurge," Stack wrote in his suicide note. He moved to his native
Colorado, where he graduated in 1979 with a degree in electronic
engineering technology from Southern Colorado University.

Then he struck out for California.

He was meticulous in his hobbies and occupations -- playing
music and writing software -- and it was in California, according
to his suicide note, where his attention turned to taxes.

"He liked the idea not only of saving himself a couple of
bucks, but of getting one over on 'the man,"' Harry Stack said.

"Some friends introduced me to a group of people who were
having tax code readings and discussions," Joe Stack wrote in his
suicide message, a manifesto of grievances that he edited 27 times
in the days before the Feb. 18 plane crash.

Ducking taxes became another fixation for Stack, and he threw
himself into a protracted struggle against the government over
money he owed.

According to The Associated Press, in the 1980s, Joe Stack and
his former wife, Ginger, formed a branch of the Universal Life
Church Inc., which the IRS declared an illegal tax shelter. The
Stacks then sued the U.S. government to defend the tax-exempt
status of the "home church."

He became further outraged by a 1986 tax code change that barred
contract software engineers from certain deductions. "They could
only have been more blunt if they would have came out and directly
declared me a criminal and non-citizen slave," Stack wrote in his
manifesto.

The year after the tax code change he spent close to $5,000 to
protest and at least 1,000 hours "writing, printing, and mailing
to any senator, congressman, governor, or slug that might listen."

"I spent countless hours on the L.A. freeways driving to
meetings and any and all of the disorganized professional groups
who were attempting to mount a campaign against this atrocity," he
wrote.

But when Harry Stack visited his brother in California, he left
the impression that he "was just a person trying to make a
living."

"He seemed like one of us ducks floating down the river. We
just didn't realize he was paddling so furiously under the water,"
Harry Stack said.

'Financially sane'

On a flight aboard his Piper to New Mexico in 2005, Stack told
Simone Wensink, the singer in their band -- Last Straw, named by
Stack -- that he had moved to Austin because living was cheaper,
the flying easier and the music scene thriving.

He had left behind in California a divorce, a depressed economic
climate and, according to his note, a government doggedly chasing
after his savings. In 1988, after five years of litigation, the
Stacks were ordered to pay $14,446 in back taxes from 1981, 1982
and 1983, and untold penalties and interest for fraud and
negligence, according to U.S. Tax Court documents obtained by The
Associated Press.

"He was a good man," his ex-wife in California told the Los
Angeles Times on the day of the crash. "Frustrated with the IRS,
yes, but a good man."

On that 2005 flight to New Mexico, Stack was on his way to meet
someone, and Wensink tagged along so she could meet a friend. That
wasn't unusual: Stack often offered plane rides to his friends and
bandmates.

"He took their families and kids to San Antonio or to the coast
for dinner," said Paul Ramsey, who engineered Last Straw's sole
album in his recording studio, Perfect Pitch. "He told me, 'If you
ever have a gig and a session and can't ditch either one, just give
me a call and pay the gas."'

"Everyone in the band just loved him to death. They looked to
him for answers -- musical, intellectual," Ramsey said.

Wensink, who sang "A Certain Kind of Magic," the only
Stack-written song on the album, said he was a motivated, on-time
band musician.

He was also careful about the recording of the music.

"The only problem (he and I) ever had was analog versus
digital," remembered Ramsey, who said he last saw Stack at least a
year ago. "He tried to get the band to leave because I didn't have
a computer."

Eventually, Ramsey prevailed, engineered and mixed the album.
Stack, he said, was extremely pleased at how it came out.

"He had a vocabulary that stretched around the world three
times," Ramsey said. "He seemed like he was financially sane and
sound. All his equipment was nice, his watch was nice, his car was
nice, his glasses were nice, and his hygiene was flawless."

Before he burned it down, authorities say, Stack's house in a
modest North Austin subdivision, Scofield Farms, was valued at
$232,000, according to records with the Travis Central Appraisal
District. Prices for his sort of plane, a four-seater,
single-propeller Piper Cherokee Dakota, start at about $100,000 on
the Web site tradeaplane.com.

Just as he had with the band name, Stack volunteered "Over the
Edge" as the album title, and it stuck.

The band lasted through 2007, playing gigs at Graffiti's, at the
Alligator Grill, on an unofficial South by Southwest Music Festival
stage and on a network television morning show.

But Wensink got married, as did Stack, who wed Sheryl Housh in a
small ceremony that year, and the band dissolved. And Stack lost
touch with at least some of his bandmates.

'Stop this insanity'

"He was a mixture of tech nerd and laid-back musician,"
recalled Susan Kidwell, a neighbor in Northwest Austin whose family
occasionally had dinner with the Stacks, attended some of their
house concerts and had them over to watch football games. "He was
quiet and milquetoasty, nice and polite."

The Saturday before Stack crashed his plane, his stepdaughter,
Margaux, came over to play video games with the Kidwells' son.
Sheryl Stack picked her up, and nothing seemed amiss.

Kidwell said Stack was supportive of his wife, who is in a
doctoral music program at the University of Texas. Sheryl Stack,
who spent the night before Joe Stack crashed his plane in a hotel
room with Margaux, declined to comment.

When the Stacks came over to watch the Super Bowl in early
February, he greeted Kidwell with a hug. Everyone was rooting for
the New Orleans Saints. Sheryl joked that Joe Stack would root for
the Indianapolis Colts just to be contrary.

"From time to time we talked about politicians, but I never
heard a single political comment that stuck in my mind," she said.

During the University of Texas vs. Texas A&M football game in
November, Stack took issue with the Longhorns' play-calling.
Insanity, he told Kidwell and others gathered to watch the game, is
repeating the same thing and expecting a different outcome each
time.

A couple of months later, in his manifesto, he would write: "I
saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating
the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to
suddenly be different. I am finally ready to stop this insanity.
Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take
my pound of flesh and sleep well."

Some who knew Stack best did not want to talk about him --
adding to the mystery of a man with a history of shutting doors
behind him. He had no children of his own. He and his ex-wife were
married for 18 years before divorcing in 1999, but after her
initial comments to the press, Ginger Stack did not return phone
calls from the Austin American-Statesman.

Harry Stack had not been in touch with his brother for 15 years,
did not know that he had moved to Texas, did not know that he had
remarried and did not know that he had set up a new life.

He learned of his fate when he read a news story about the plane
attack online, clicked on the manifesto and saw his brother's name.

"It was dreadful," he said, choking up.

Joe Stack had acted alone, with a terrible determination, as he
had so often in his life.

"It's kind of an American ideal -- 'You're on your own, captain
of my fate,"' said Harry Stack. "Part of his thinking there is
that what happens to you in your life, the circumstances you find
yourself in, are largely the circumstances you make for yourself --
it's all up to you. You're just on your own."

Then, sounding weary, he added, "I just wish he said, 'I'm in a
bind, and I need some help."'
