Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's People of  Freedom (PDL) party Thursday
gathered in Rome for a meeting of its leaders amid growing dissent within the
party.

Berlusconi welcomed 477 party representatives ahead of the six-hour meeting
touting his government's accomplishments and its win in recent regional
elections.

"I don't think one can say this party is not democratic," Berlusconi told a
packed auditorium, apparently deflecting criticism that his party leadership is
authoritarian.

In recent weeks, PDL has been mired in controversy as an internal faction led by
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies has challenged
Berlusconi's decisions and its closeness to the anti-immigration Northern League
party.

"I hope that Berlusconi accepts that there is dissent internal to PDL," Fini
said on Tuesday, adding that "I have no intention of leaving or of being quiet."

Berlusconi responded on Wednesday saying that "it is not possible for currents
to exist" within the party, describing such elements as "metastases."

Berlusconi's Forza Italia party and the ex-fascist National Alliance party, led
by Fini, merged two years ago to form PDL.

In late March, the coalition made up by PDL and the Northern League won six
regions out of 13, wresting control of four regions from the centre-left despite
flagging approval ratings reflected in a dismal turnout.
