Romania's ruling coalition collapsed Thursday when Social Democratic party
ministers resigned to protest the sacking of a minister.

The Social Democrat (PSD) ministers walked out three days after Interior
Minister Dan Nica was thrown out of the cabinet amid accusations of election
fraud.

PSD leader Mircea Geona blamed President Traian Basescu, from the Liberal
Democrats (PDL), for the "political crisis which adds to the economic and social
crisis" battering the East European country.

The coalition broke up less than two months before a presidential election on
November 22. Under Romania's constitution no legislative elections can be called
in the six months before a presidential vote.

Analysts had been predicting the break up of the 10-month-old coalition for
weeks. The parties have rival candidates in the presidential election and
relations have been worsening.

Prime Minister Emil Boc, from the PDL, can now either name temporary ministers
for a maximum of 45 days or find replacements from other parties, according to
Ivan Stanomir, a professor at the faculty of political science in Bucharest.

If he finds full-time replacements, Boc would have to seek parliamentary
approval for his move. If he chooses temporary ministers, the government would
have "very little legitimacy", according to Stanomir.

Economy Minister Adriean Videanu, who comes from the PDL, said the party would
carry on with government duties and criticised the PSD for causing the breakup
for "electoral motives".

The prime minister sacked Nica after he alleged that the PSD would try to rig
the presidential election.

Nica said the PDL had rented all available buses on voting day to transport
people to different polling stations so they can vote several times. The
multiple-vote scheme has been widely used in Romanian elections.

Boc also blamed Nica for a crime explosion in the country as a rift between
rival parties in the ruling coalition widened ahead of the presidential
election.

The two parties blamed each other for the crisis.

President Basescu proposed a meeting of party leaders on Tuesday to avoid a
split but this was rejected by the PSD.
