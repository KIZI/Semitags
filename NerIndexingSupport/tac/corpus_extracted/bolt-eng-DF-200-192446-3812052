which is the best of our big cities? excepting london.
birmingham is nearest london, and the second largest, but some say a bit too multicultural.
sheffield is a friendly city and near countryside.
liverpool is dynamic and happening, but perhaps too far from london.
heck, you decide, which is the best of our big cities??
 
 
liverpool but im not exactly a fair judge
 
 
Manchester
 
 
Aberdeen.
 
 
Liverpool.
2 hours away from London by train.
 
 
Peterborough.

(lol.)

how dangerous is liverpool. i note the students all seem to live far away in wavertree. is toxteth etc. near the centre too dangerous?
what's smithdown road/wavertree like? i'm guessing that they are safe.
 
 
liverpool!
 
 
Manchester
 
 
Liverpool!

Scousers get a bad press - they're really nice.
 
 
 
Liverpool.
2 hours away from London by train.

 

2 hours is not bad. how much does it cost?

liverpool on paper looks good. lovely architecture. but has that chav reputation. and long ago the toxteth riots. can anyone compare it to a southern city like bristol or even brum.

hey, no one seems to have a good word to say about brum, even though it has more canals than venice!

Well ive got a return to London for £4. But I touched lucky, on the day you'll pay £60 return, but in advance £22 return.

Chav reputation is out of the city centre, so if its just for uni you wont see it, if you venture out there are nice places too, like anywhere.
Toxteth riots, everywhere has a history, but its precisely that, history.
 
 
Lol definitely not Birmingham (even though i'm from there, i acknowledge it's a bit of a ****e hole.)

I'd say Manchester or Liverpool.
 
 
birmingham, liverpool os full of chavs, though manc is a good contender, aberdeen though in the beautiful country of Scotland, I would says can never contend with the others

You think Toxteth is safer than the city centre?  
Toxteth is where my auntie Michelle lives and her kids are right little c**ts. The city centre is fine.

Liverpool is as safe as any city (assuming you're not walking around acting like a shaft) and from personal experience much safer than London:
been to London twice, mugged once; been to Liverpool hundreds of times, never had worse than some 10 year old pull on my former ponytail for a bet.

its not dangerous at all. Most of the students I know live in the city centre. I always go to the city centre and have never had a crime commited against me

how come you're not so keen on your own city? is it because dangerous or too multicultural? i mean the advantage of brum is clear, it is the second biggest city in england.
presumably around univesity - selly oak area - is nice. or maybe not?

i went to sheffield university, is a good university, with the biggest student union in england.

sheffield is a lovely city.

but liverpool is a kind of fun sounding place - like newcastle for that matter.

i note a lot of scousers sticking up for liverpool. no one sticking up for brum. and you, you stuck up for sheffield. also noted a few vote for manchester - of which i know very little.
 
 
 
Oxford?

 

oxford is a nice city. but it is not big. it' more in the category of brighton or bath: pleasant small cities.

i wanna know about the mean streets of the big cities of this country!

Yeah the bit around the Uni is nice, but overall it's just a hole lol. It's got no real identity unlike cities such as Liverpool, it's really grey and industrial and just really bland. Put it this way, i don't know of anybody who hopes to still live in Birmingham when they're older-i think that says something lol.

I'd say either Sheffield or Manchester, but I'm from Yorkshire so I'm kind of bias, haha.

Everyone i talk to absolutely loves the city, what makes you and the people you talk too think it's a ****hole?

I've been to both as i'm a Liverpool supporter(was a season ticket holder) and have been to Manchester numerous times as i have family friends down there both don't compare at all to Birmingham especially liverpool as for Manchester i can see the comparison but i still believe it's not even in B'ham league and especially so now that Birmingham is getting heavy investment from foreign investor and in around 10 years the centre will be unrecognizable.

Not to mention the crime rates in both Liverpool and Manchester are a lot greater than in B'ham.

manchester is surprisingly close to sheffield. but in lancashire. so you've not been overly yorkshire-centric!
did you know of the biggest 5 cities in england, 3 are in yorkshire. the list goes:-
1. london
2. birmingham
3. leeds
4. sheffield
5. bradford

yes bradford is bigger than manchester and liverpool. but also so dire as not to be worth considering.

Really?!??! What part of Birmingham do u live in? I genuinely don't know of one person who would like to live in Birmingham when they're older-everyone wants to move out.

Hey maybe with the investment it will get better, but right now it's grey, got no identity/atmosphere, is really "ghetto" in places (although i'm sure that's the case elsewhere in big cities so i'm not saying that specific to Bham) and basically seems to have all the bad things that London has, but none of the good.

crime is an intersting point. some say brum is dangerous because many different nationalities/ethnicities and all fighting over turf. so i was thinking liverpool being full of mainly pure bred scousers might be safer.

nnnyeah - the people drawing these lists up generally include greater london (as the city of london proper is tiny) but do not include the boroughs of greater manchester making up the conurbation which is obviously bigger than some of the cities ranked above it if you actually go and eyeball these places.

for uni I'd always suggest going for a city near a river (or on a slope) as it makes it easier to find your way home drunk. sorry brum

Most of those can be attributed to other areas of the city, away from the University, and nicer area such as Edgbaston, Harbroune and such.
Places like Handsworth, Aston, Highgate etc

 http://www.upmystreet.com/local/crime-in-manchesterhtml  (actually Mancs is considerably higher than the national average)
 http://www.upmystreet.com/local/crime-in-liverpool.html ,- same with Liverpool.

Birmingham has the lowest crime rates reported of all major UK cities and about 7 or so smaller ones,- it's a fact >.<
Manchester is equally as high with the crime against person rate, although I prefer Mancs.
 
 
Why did you leave Manchester off that list?

Liverpool and Manchester are both excellent, I'm from Manc myself but have lived in Liverpool for 3 years for uni. It's not dangerous, I've had no trouble whatsoever.

Liverpool is as safe as any other city, provided you use common sense.

Toxteth and Wavertree are the same distance away from town (in fact Toccy is on one side of Smithdown and Wavertree is on the other). Toxteth used to be dangerous, but it's cleaned up it's rep a bit.

Smithdown Road area is a typical inner city area, rows of terraced houses and shops, it's on a bus route that gets a bus towards the Uni about every 6/7 minutes. The only reason students live there is it's the student part of town (like Selly Oak in Birmingham, Fallowfield in Manchester or Kelvinhall in Glasgow)

Back onto topic, my favourite of the three is Liverpool, think it got into my blood while I was a student there, to the extent, I work nearby and will be moving back over there in a matter of weeks

Manchester is also a scary ****hole though, at least on the student end.
I'm not a fan of Birmingham because AFAIK most of it isn't a nice area (the same goes for Manchester) whereas in Sheffield you have few crappy areas tbh.

i went for liverpool: as most happening/partying place - although obviously madchester makes a claim for that too. but the scousers also have the maritime history.

went for sheffield because known to be very friendly and close to the countryside.

went for brum because at 1 million-ish, much bigger than others: i think leeds is about 3/4 million, sheffield 1/2 million, rest smaller.

I live in Edgbaston but regularly visit other place in B'ham and although some parts are pretty dull i would have no qualm about entering those certain areas whereas with Manchester/Liverpol there is defintely a number of areas i wouldn't even dare enter. You are entitled to your opinion but i truly believe after London, Birmingham is the best city in England.

 
crime is an intersting point. some say brum is dangerous because many different nationalities/ethnicities and all fighting over turf. so i was thinking liverpool being full of mainly pure bred scousers might be safer.

 

There is no turf war in Birmingham that i know off apart from the usual drug related problems but those that are involved target specific people rather than innocent bystanders nothing at all compared to Londons postcode problem. Most of the nationalities get on perfectly fine with very little hostility ever shown. For some reason a great deal of people from outside the city make up their own pre -conceived negative opinions about the city without ever visiting it.

well the stats do look good. but i'm suspicious. how come the bad rep.? is it because brum further down south and southerners expect higher standards of behaviour!!
 
 
Ok so Sheffield is about 1.5 hours from London on the train these days, and in some ways I think it's the best city in England. However, 50% of the city is in the ****. Completely messed up, uncared for, and working class without the once-prevalent coal and steel industry. So, in that respect, I think Sheffield has bad press. BUT it's completely underrated..

cloop herself: another reason to vote sheffield!

i really only know west and central sheffield. so the industrial bit not so knowledgeable about, but i imagine it is as you say a bit rubbish.

i think sheffield has a good rep, known to be friendly, full of folk constantly calling you "love" - even if you're male!!

Are you asking us which city is the 'best'? Each city has its own appeal but it really depends on what appeals most to you. Manchester is more 'happening' than Liverpool, trust me, and it has a better club scene. Liverpool has maritime history, Manchester has industrial history.

I don't particularly care for Sheffield.

you are a true brummie. stout in defence of your city. ozzy would be proud of you!
it's a tricky thing comparing cities, because few people have experience of many cities. easy to get an idea of london, because yes plenty of folk have lived there and in other cities too. but the provincial cities are not so well known, understood. so as you say many judgements are passed on the basis of few facts.
 
 
 
well the stats do look good. but i'm suspicious. how come the bad rep.? is it because brum further down south and southerners expect higher standards of behaviour!!

 

Because there's a big divide in the city in terms of wealth, income, healthcare provision and investment.
It's a shame really, the city centre outwards, towards the north parts of the city are ****holes.

i am asking which is the best city. and i'll have no truck with any relativisitic nonsense.
yes some people might prefer sunderland uni to oxford on the grounds that there is quite a nice cafe in the student union. but... we all know which is really the best uni.
similarly one of our big provincial cities is the best. and i seek to discover which one it is!!
o.k., manchester beats liverpool for clubbing and for industry. but liverpool has the sea, and "the beatles", and... and rather lovely victorian suburbs - not like the dire suburbs of brum. i'm veering towards liverpool, but then all those shell suits!!!

ahh, that's interesting. so if we split brum in half, north and south and looked at the south.
the new city South Brum, still big, half a million folk (i've made it an even split): now does this city start to look good in comparison with sheffield (also half a million) and liverpool (a shade under half a million)?
South Brum is it less multiculutural, less known for grey housing and few parks? i guess edgbaston introduces some greenery.

The docks is easily the nicest part of Liverpool. Sometimes the Navy will roll into town which never happens in Manchester.   And yep, the Georgian/Edwardian houses are very pretty - the Uni of Liverpool owns many of them, I have lectures in a converted Georgian terrace.  

However, "the Beatles" gets old, very quick. Shell suits? I haven't seen any. But I have seen girls out shopping with rollers in their hair.
 
 
Birmingham is just such a depressing city I question why people move there. JUST NOT BIRMINGHAM. Which place is more depressing Chelmsley Wood or Birmingham lol.
 
 
 
*facepalm* Hater in the building.

Birmingham by a distance as Manchester and Liverpool don't even compare to England 2nd city can't believe this is even up for discussion.

 

Birmingham gets talked down way too much, mostly by people who've never been...having been to all three, Birmingham is by far my favourite - sure it's got its bad parts but they're massively outnumbered by the good.
 
 
Manchester.
 
 
Liverpool!
 
 
birmingham.

Basing this on what? I'm not from Liverpool but the city centre is far nicer than most British cities, albeit with some rough suburbs.
 
 
I love both cities for different reasons but there's far more stuff to do in Liverpool than Sheffield; it's more dynamic, a bigger sense of community culture, better nightlife/shopping/commercial side, better architecture. And yes, I've lived in both so I can speak for both.

I don't like Manchester as to put it bluntly, and to quote Jamie from this years Apprentice, "It's like London but 10 years behind." It's big and sprawling but not in a good way. It's got loads of nice theatres and stuff, but it doesn't have the same sense of distinct individuality Liverpool or even Sheffield has and the general consensus of the people is far more 'conservative' than London. (That's probably a bad adjective to use, perhaps I mean 'less cosmopolitan').

Can't speak for Brum.

Hope this helped.

Pretty much all British city centres are passable these days - they're all basically singing from the same hymnsheet of gentrified middle class housing and new identikit shopping centres with the same stores.

But most of Liverpool outside the centre is a complete dump and suffers from serious urban decay.

Complete rubbish. Some inner-city areas are awful, but not the majority as you seem to be suggesting. There are some really nice and highly desirable areas surrounding the city, and I'm not even talking about in the extremities of Liverpool suburbia: Childwall, Allerton, Mossley Hill, Aigburth... The boarded up house of Edge Lane and the not-so-recent shooting in Norris Green isn't all Liverpool's inner-city has to offer. The city centre itself you obviously haven't visited or visited without a chip on your shoulder to realise it definitely isn't 'singing from the same hymn sheet' as most other cities. It's more characteristically unique than any other city I've been to.

Please refrain from spilling your guts over things which you clearly know nothing about.

hey purplemonkey, you seem to know what you're talking about. i know sheffield well, and it is a bit boring - but feels nice and safe. whereas liverpool seems more interesting, but perhaps more dangerous. do you know what wavertree is like? round those roads with "dale" in them, weardale etc. the architecture of liverpool suburbs is markedly better than sheffield: lots of gorgeous double bayed victorian terraces.
 
 
 
what's selly oak, the bit by the university like? students and some locals - but what kind of locals!

Selly Oak is densely populated by students, basically after first year everyone lives there.
It's not exactly nice, but it's so studenty that people don't really care.
Take away galore, always open til like 4/5 in the morning. Good several pubs and bars, great for pub golf, or just a pub meal.
Train station right there, big Sainsburys, as well as a Tesco 24 hour metro petrol station, council pool and gym with sauna (students can use for free).

The University is technically in Edgbaston, campus is actually lovely.
But Edgbaston is not the only posh bit thanks!
Harborne is where it's at, which is the opposite side of campus to Selly Oak.
[So Selly Oak is South, Edgbaston is east and Harborne North.]
It's the nearest High Street; Waitrose, M&S, WHSmiths, Clintons, Cafe Rouge, Cafe Nero, etc. Harborne is famous for its 'Harborne Mile', something like 10 pubs in a row. Much more sophisticated than Selly Oak.

I don't like how you're attaching 'poverty' to the rest of it. Every big city has its scuzzy bits. The City Centre is pretty good. Broad Street has like 15 'clubs' on it, alternative scene in Digbeth, there is a gay quarter, chinese quarter and of course the Bullring.
Solihul is just outside it and is very nice, but I suppose isn't actually technically Birmingham.
As for the scuzzy bits, surely you won't ever need to go there?!
 
 
 
Complete rubbish. Some inner-city areas are awful, but not the majority as you seem to be suggesting. There are some really nice and highly desirable areas surrounding the city, and I'm not even talking about in the extremities of Liverpool suburbia: Childwall, Allerton, Mossley Hill, Aigburth... The boarded up house of Edge Lane and the not-so-recent shooting in Norris Green isn't all Liverpool's inner-city has to offer. The city centre itself you obviously haven't visited or visited without a chip on your shoulder to realise it definitely isn't 'singing from the same hymn sheet' as most other cities. It's more characteristically unique than any other city I've been to.

Please refrain from spilling your guts over things which you clearly know nothing about.

 

Agreed, also all the run down areas are part of the regeneration anyway. The houses on Edge Lane have pretty much all been knocked down now. Liverpool has nicer subarban areas than most cities, Allerton and Aigburth are really nice and pretty expensive. Even Toxteth and such are starting to be alright.

Every city has crime, there really is no way of getting away from it.

Liverpool is amazing!
 
 
 
i am asking which is the best city. and i'll have no truck with any relativisitic nonsense.
yes some people might prefer sunderland uni to oxford on the grounds that there is quite a nice cafe in the student union. but... we all know which is really the best uni.
similarly one of our big provincial cities is the best. and i seek to discover which one it is!!
o.k., manchester beats liverpool for clubbing and for industry. but liverpool has the sea, and "the beatles", and... and rather lovely victorian suburbs - not like the dire suburbs of brum. i'm veering towards liverpool, but then all those shell suits!!!

 

Coming from near Liverpool I know quite a bit about the place... There are fantastic Edwardian houses for uni students, great bars to visit and a great atmosphere on a night out. Avoid Bootle (the people will drive anyone insane).

Otherwise the docks are indeed the best place to be, very chilled place
 
 
Liverpool city centre is okay. I lived there for five years during its recent development. But I also lived in Anfield and that town is the bowels of hell.
 
 
Manchester  
 
 
Hull.

lol jk, don't hate me.

Theres a few more than 10 pubs in the Harborne run if you do it properly. A few gems tucked away round the side streets and a lovely little one by st Peters church.

People from Solihull get really arsey if you say its part of Brum, quite posh round most parts (apart from Chelmsley) but it gets a bit lairy at night. Sutton Coldfield is a good night out too which is about 10 mins from New street on the train.
