Good Morning Tricredibles.

Is anyone interested in riding Saturday morning rather than Sunday? LSU has
a late game Saturday night against Va Tech and I'm afraid that a Sunday am
ride may interfere with my LSU tailgating.

Have a great week.
Geaux Tigers!

Ironman Wisconsin is this Sunday, Sept. 9, and I plan to watch the swim
start, so won't make a 7 am Sunday ride.  Saturday would be better.  I
believe that registration for Ironman Wisconsin 2008 will be this coming
Monday for those interested in doing it next year.
