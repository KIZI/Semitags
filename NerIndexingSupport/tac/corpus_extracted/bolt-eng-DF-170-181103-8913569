Some USMB members have suggested that China has become a capitalistic society.

I pointed out that even China describes itself as a "communist country" and our government sees China as a "communist country" and in spite of that, there are some that say China is not only a "capitalistic society", but the leader of the country is actually the CEO.

Is this a "mainstream" belief? Does it come from mostly one party?

China can call itself whatever it wants, the simple fact of the matter is that China has a mixed-economy. If they were a truly communist country they'd be a third-world country just like North Korea. Did you know the Chinese Communist Party accepts open capitalists into its ranks? China is communist in name only.
 
 
I was going to watch Monty Python "Holy Grail" for a few laughs, but then I saw this thread.
 
 
OK, here's what we know so far:

1. It's an rdean thread.
2. It mentions some subject and Republicans in the OP.
 
 
3. 90% of republicans are white

I would define it more as an oligarchy. The economy is mixed at this point.

Basically people can make money now, but have very little political clout.

China is a communist corporation. UScitizen said that and he/she was spot on!

The commies are gonna win yet after 100 years of the west trying to destroy them.

Worse yet we are fulfilling Stalin's prophecy that " capitalists would sell you the rope to hang them with". Via our debt of course.

Doesn't that make you feel proud?

If anything it is our government that is feeding our nation into the gaping jaws of China. So they can feed us to their pets.

What do you suggest we do to change the situation?
 
 
You ever read "Animal Farm?" It seems China has reached the same stage of political development as Animal farm had by the end of the book.

They can call themselves what they like. A name is just a label. the contents of the label can be anything you want it to be. The call themselves communists. So that is what they are. But what they seem to have achieved is sort of what Mussolini was going for with his ideal of a corporate state.

All this is and has long been known to everyone, as it is pretty obvious. Why has the obvious escaped you till very recently

Next time you pull this 5h17 I will neg you. That was uncalled for.

What kind of fantasy universe, short on oxygen, do yo live in that you would ever make that anti intellectual leap? I think I have been very civil with you on this issue, but you are really pushing the ethical envelope here.

 I have discovered a new label for you : Ignoranus  And I think that is the way I will address you from now on.

You're the one who said, "But what they seem to have achieved is sort of what Mussolini was going for with his ideal of a corporate state".

Add the fact that most, if not all right wingers have only terrible things to say about our government.

Add in this insult, "Why has the obvious escaped you till very recently" and I believe my question was fair.

So you don't like their government. You don't like our government. What kind of government do you like?

Unless you live in total chaos, with no food, air, water, road or any kind of safety, and no military, VA, Social Security, no NASA, no technology no nothing, what kind of government do you like? The "Wild West"? Afghanistan? Iraq? I would think Republicans like Iraq since they put it together.

I have been on this board a good long time, and we have posted back and forth a lot, and you know where I stand on this stuff. You know that none of us "Right Wingers" have much of anything to say about Musso or Adolf, or their variations of socialism.

That is why I am calling on you to apolgise for your gross insult. You know what I have written about this kind of thing, and that remark was way uncalled for.

there is a limit to stupid. I know you have the IQ of a stunned gerbil, but even you know better than this. It was just a pointless and stupid snarkiness all the worse for being morally wrong.

All your posting seems to imply there are only two ways, Stupid straw or your insanity de jour.

As we have all made very clear to you, us righties like limited democratic government that protects the nation and the people from violence, and maintains the roads. It does not preach to us, it does not use us, it does not rule us, it does not take money from us to waste on frivolity, when we can waste our money better.

Now crawl back under your rock and stay there.

Some of them can join the communist party, which gives them a bit of say. Really the difference is marginal, i agree.
 
 
How come its the communist made weapons that seem to be the weapons that kill our soldiers.
 
 
No, it's a fascist country!

It isn't, you just have shit for brains.
 
 
With its strong emphasis on technology, the military, strong single-party leadership and a collective national identity that refuses to recognize pluralism, China is displaying increasing — and worrying — symptoms of fascism. From the military parade surrounding the 60th anniversary of the birth of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on Oct. 1 to forced relocation and assimilation programs targeting ethnic minority groups such as the Uighurs, China is in many ways reminding us of the fascist states that reared their ugly heads in the first half of the previous century.

Yes, but in the case of the National Socialists it's not very misleading. It's true that Hitler's National Socialism was not socialism in its purest sense, but it was a form of fascism which is certainly closely related to socialism.

None of which is the sole province of the right-wing.
 
 
China is not communist...It is state capitalism...hahaha...I joke...did you notice how the word communist has evolved into state capitalist...Very well done progressives. Now when you turn your destructive eye on the helpless workers of China and try to unionize them, you can still refer to capitalism as a bad thing. Will the progressives still feel bad when the government does an anti-union crackdown and a couple million chinese workers suddenly disappear?

The big secret is debt cant hurt us, not our debt, we print the money, if China wants to dump the dollar I say we buy it all. Why not, we can just start printing money. Dont you think the rich and powerful can manipulate the markets and in a minute make China eat all that debt.

I tell you what, if I was the leader of the world, I mean the USA, I would just start printing the money to give to China. Thats the funny part, they can sell it, we can buy it, but they got to accept US dollars. They sell everything and get useless US dollars.

We are that powerful. Its great.

Yes, they were under Mao, but like you say they began to move away from communism after his death. The level of growth they've undergone would not have been possible under communism.

And that's the problem with the right wing. They try desperately to simplify everything. On one hand, they say "limited government", but then promote the most intrusive government you could possibly imagine with laws against gays and women's rights, the patriot act and so on.

When they say "limited government" they really mean "give corporations a free hand to do anything they want".

Our government is made up of our neighbors that we vote into office, yet the right wing goes on endlessly about the government being some kind of shadowy conspiratorial cabal who wants to "rule us" and "take away our freedoms".

They say they don't want the government to "preach" to us, but do that with their continuous need to interject "Gawd" into science and public schools. Does it bother them that those of us without mystical or supernatural beliefs may not want our children exposed to such nonsense? No, it doesn't. They can't see the "other side" because they are the "party of patriotism and morals", only they aren't.

And that terrible lack of education. It hamstrings the entire nation. What they consider "frivolous spending", many leftwingers see as "research" and "investing in our future".

So go ahead and feel all insulted and angry. The nation is at war. A war between the future and turning us into a "Christian Taliban".

It does not preach to us, it does not use us, it does not rule us, it does not take money from us to waste on frivolity, when we can waste our money better.

Now crawl back under your rock and stay there.

 

And that's the problem with the right wing. They try desperately to simplify everything. On one hand, they say "limited government", but then promote the most intrusive government you could possibly imagine with laws against gays and women's rights, the patriot act and so on.

When they say "limited government" they really mean "give corporations a free hand to do anything they want".

Our government is made up of our neighbors that we vote into office, yet the right wing goes on endlessly about the government being some kind of shadowy conspiratorial cabal who wants to "rule us" and "take away our freedoms".

They say they don't want the government to "preach" to us, but do that with their continuous need to interject "Gawd" into science and public schools. Does it bother them that those of us without mystical or supernatural beliefs may not want our children exposed to such nonsense? No, it doesn't. They can't see the "other side" because they are the "party of patriotism and morals", only they aren't.

And that terrible lack of education. It hamstrings the entire nation. What they consider "frivolous spending", many leftwingers see as "research" and "investing in our future".

So go ahead and feel all insulted and angry. The nation is at war. A war between the future and turning us into a "Christian Taliban".

 China Railway High-speed - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

China has 4,000 miles of high-speed rail system. The longest in the world. Meanwhile, the US limps along on years old technology.
They make good use of the interest on our debt.

And if the right has it's way, will continue to do so.
 
 
 
 
 
I have been on this board a good long time, and we have posted back and forth a lot, and you know where I stand on this stuff. You know that none of us "Right Wingers" have much of anything to say about Musso or Adolf, or their variations of socialism.

That is why I am calling on you to apolgise for your gross insult. You know what I have written about this kind of thing, and that remark was way uncalled for.

there is a limit to stupid. I know you have the IQ of a stunned gerbil, but even you know better than this. It was just a pointless and stupid snarkiness all the worse for being morally wrong.

I can't tell if you're complaining or boasting.

I notice you didn't say, "This part is wrong". Why? Because we both know you can't.

This part right here has got to be a real "headscratcher" for your kind:

Our government is made up of our neighbors that we vote into office, yet the right wing goes on endlessly about the government being some kind of shadowy conspiratorial cabal who wants to "rule us" and "take away our freedoms".

Then Frank wails: But they ARE a, "shadowy conspiratorial cabal who wants to "rule us" and "take away our freedoms"."
 
 
 
 
 
Well the claim was that they were a communist country, which is an economic system not a political system in and of itself. It's true that they are an authoritarian state.

 

IOW China is the very first truly communist state.

 

Are we not counting the Soviet Union?

 

There is no way the SU meets the definition of a commyist state. They were a pure autocratic state that never had a transition from socialism toward commyism and their revolution was carried out by 5% of their population for political reasons moreso than as an economic revolution.

Only China has managed to combine the economic elements of communism with the political elements of a top down state, albeit with a somewhat freeish market domestic economy.

Well if we go by those guidelines then we can safely say there has never been a communist state, including China.
