 
 
do you care about John Terry being allegedly "racist"?
 
 
why does being non-racist matter? Don't people secretly desire a return to a more racist state? Admit it, we're deluding ourselves.  
 
 
Racist or not, I can't stand the man. Nothing more than an over-paid, unintellingent, arrogant ********.
 
 
I think there are bigger issues of racism which this one statement is distracting everyone from.
 
 
but most white British people have racist thoughts, so what is the issue? Racism is normal.
 
 
I dont really believe he has any secret racist beliefs against black people considering a lot of chelsea's success in the last 5 or 6 years has been to the influence of balck players i.e Drogba, A.Cole, Makelele, Hasselbaink etc

Or maybe the performances of Kalou has caused him too much grief.

White Britons? Or do you mean native majorities world wide?

yes, white Britons. Can you read everybody's mind?
 
 
It wouldn't surprise me given John Terry is a mug of the highest order.
 
 
He's a 'Mong', who cares..
 
 
 
yes, white Britons. Can you read everybody's mind?

 

Whose minds?
 
 
He's losing his touch in football.

so he's not allowed to be a racist.
 
 
 
Whose minds?

 

Most british people value racism secretly and want a return to a racist society. this is patent fact, so why not let Terry allegedly say what he wants?

What did he say...article link?

Really? Is it not a devaluation of a policy of having a certain amount of ethnic minorities in a given workplace and recruited on the basis of their skin colour than merit? Is it not that no-one cares of if a black person says ****** but if a white person says it it is suddenly wrong? Is it not that our shambles of a country would rather let in and subsidise Irish travellers instead of tightening our laws, like what the Republic of Ireland did which is why travellers are here in the first place? This is not racism, just common sense. People are fed propaganda about 'racism' so they do not question discrimination against their own race. This is the problem I have with society. This is the problem I have with 'political correctness'. This is why I will never respect 'political correctness'.

As said, most UK value secretly value racism.
 
 
I think the OP just wants attention. Aww babeeeeeeee!

lol... why should I seek attention from strangers on a website? Is that logical?
 
 
I don't believe he was being racist. I think his outburst was to the ref. However IF he was being racist then he should never play for England again - certainly not be captain!

Racism shouldn't be a part of our national game. Remember a few years back when Shaun Wright-Phillips and Heskey got racist abuse from the Spanish fans? It was disgusting - this should not be happening in Britain, a liberal country.

Also I would like to add that even if John Terry was referring to the referee I still think he should be stripped of his England captaincy as calling the referee a "****ing blind ****" isn't really 'role model' attitude.

Well my theory on political correctness seems to be backed up by how you haven't been negged yet. Generalising white people apparently is fine.

I think everyone negged him for his opening post and therefore can't neg him again - unfortunately.

You tell me...? You keep talking about how most white Britons are racist inside but provide no evidence from your claim other than saying it's well known. If you want a proper debate then at least provide some substance.

I don't care what Terry says. He's just one man, and just because he's famous his words are all over the news. People say racist things every day and it doesn't get blown up. But these people don't represent us all so there's no point saying everyone is racist when they clearly aren't.

The evidence is that racism is just a smokescreen. Everybody knows that most in the UK, and the world in general, are racist. Most also know that racism is natural, and there is no logical reason why racism is "inherently wrong". Nothing is.

Define what you mean by racist? Everyone notices other peoples' skin colours and most make assumptions about their lifestyle/religion/language etc. But again for most it's not usually a problem (unless there's a specific reason why that person is 'worse' than another - maybe they're x religion and you're y, and have been brought up to view another religion a certain way).

I think you have to differentiate between racist banter between friends and actual racism and discrimination. Everyone I know makes jokes about other races/religions but it's all light hearted and said for laughs. People from certain races make jokes about their own races, using stereotypes we all know are wrong or don't represent the majority. For example, one of my white friends just now joked about how he was so 'G' and another was like 'yeah innit bruv because you black' - and he was black.
 
 
You're clearly a troll. That's clearly evidenced by your quick banning.

It's worrying that you believe this.
 
 
 
like what the Republic of Ireland did which is why travellers are here in the first place?

 

What? There are thousands of travellers in Ireland. If anything, they run into councils a lot less here than they do in the UK..ours don't have evictions and in general, there's a lot more open space where they don't come into conflict as much with other communities. Temporary sites in stupid areas do get moved on, but established sites, no. So it is an easier life for them here. The reason why they are in the UK is the same reason why loads of Irish are in the UK- there was a construction boom there at a time when there was mass unemployment and emigration in Ireland. Not because they have been booted out or had their lives made more difficult.
 
 
The whole JT thing was a bit of banter on a football pitch, things can be said in the heat of the moment and I'm sure JT regrets any wrong doing. Surely it isn't a bigger enough issue to splash all over today's Daily Mirror?
 
 
It's another shambles... But hey, it's John Terry. He'd get to be captain/be given captaincy back even if he murdered the prime minister.
