The site is financed by a non-governmental cultural foundation and mainly based on a cartoon book on the Holocaust published in 2008, which contained satirical cartoons and texts aimed at questioning the Holocaust.

The website, which opens to the Pink Panther theme song by Henry Mancini, reportedly wants to continue challenging the issue and show that "the killing of 6 million Jews in the Second World War known as the Holocaust was a sheer lie. "

 http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/n...holocaust.html 

That source is from the German DPA (Deutsche Presse-Agentur). Also from an Iranian regime funded  source.  You can see the website for yourself  here . If you don't want to click on the site, here is another example of the kind of pictures  they  have.

Examples of images are given above. Thoughts?
 
 
Burn the embassy  
 
 
Stupid  
 
 
Wow.  
 
 
I think they took the term "lolocaust" too seriously.
 
 
Just looked at the site. We get it. The Jews are wealthier, more successful and even more popular than the Muslims. Boohoo.
 
 
lol's fail me
 
 
It's okay, because they take any cartoons of Allah in good hum-

oh wait
 
 
the art styles pretty cool but lets face it you can't deny a historical fact it would be like trying to pretend slavery never existed.

Hitler killed a lot of people granted not all of the people in concentration camps were jewish but the vast majority were so iran doesn't have a leg to stand on.
 
 
There are oly about 10 million jews in the world.

Now look at this  www.jinfo.org/Nobel_Prizes.html 

180 Nobel prizes have been awarded to those of Jewish origin.

Now look that this:

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_count ry

There are 350 million Arabs in the world today, there are 65 million Iranians.

Count the persians and arabs (there are only 2 listed Iranians and one of them is Doris bloody Lessing!)

A flawed measure of worth, but interesting all the same.

Barack Obama has a Nobel Peace Prize. I think that says it all.

Yes, for peace.

The science, literature and economic ones hold more clout than the peace prize.

O dear that devalues Mr Arafat's gong, and he constituded 25% of Arab input, by my count.

That's untrue:

Algeria: 2
Egypt: 4
Nigeria: 1
RSA: 9

Did you not read the list or do you struggle with geography?
 
 
This is just idiotic  
 
 
On a different point, and on further reflection: "holocartoons" - what **** word play. At least "Lolocaust" has some merit.

Jealousy much?
 
 
I thought it was some modern cinema showing holographic films but no, it's just anti-semitic cartoons.
 
 
LOL @ that pic so true!!!
 
 
I wonder if they would find me setting up a site with cartoons of mohammed acceptable?

What is your point? Not really relevant to the thread is it
 
 
I love Iran. Ahmadinejad's foreign policy is simply, lets piss off as many people as possible before we get invaded.
 
 
Ahmedinejad is just jealous because he's a filthy tyrant who's policies have ran a once-great country into a fascist hellhole. It won't be long before this man and his chronies get taken care of - the sooner the better, imo.
 
 
Absolutely disgusting. Holocaust deniers should be punished, it's appalling.

Lmao. I haven't seen it, but that's pretty weird considering we have an African Soc.  
 
 
This is obviously an emotive topic, but lets keep posts sensible and discussing the topic respectfully and rationally. One word posts, rude or insensitive posts, and anything else that breaks TSR's rules, will be removed and the poster warned.

Whether you deny that it was that many, or that Hitler ordered these people to be killed at random, and that so many of them just 'happened' to be Jews, you at least need some sense beaten knocked into you.

I don't see the problem here.If there is not absolute proof of something then it can absolutley be questioned. There is nothing disgusting about this. Also if I am right didn't Hitler burn mass graves in order to conceal his crimes? If he did then wouldn't this mean there should be discrepancies in the total count.

I don't think too many people claim that. But that's just a hillarious sentiment that they simply happened to be Jews.

The is financed by a non-governmental cultural foundation. It has nothing to do with Ahmadinejad.
 
 
This is the heart of every Islamic debate on TSR, this thread sums up it for it that most of what is happening in the world today is really zionism vs Islam.

I'm not questioning the credibility of the Nobel Prize Committee right here right now, but Arafat got his for being a puppet.

No, the vast majority of what's happening in the world today has nothing to do with either Zionism or Islam. It's just much of that isn't particularly debate-worthy, and TSR seems to have vocal supporters of both sides.

This thread is simply a debate about a pretty silly website.
 
 
Funny of how this cartoon is related to the zionist jews that everyone is throwing a tantrum. When a cartoon was made of Prophet MOhammed and at that time, everyone was saying that it was acceptable under freedom of speech.

So why are these cartoons any different??? Care to explain...Muslims who protested against the MOhammed (Pbuh) cartoons were labelled as extremists so is the Tsr a board for extremists?? Because everyone on this thread is protesting against these jewish cartoons.

People don't seem to be protesting the right of the authors to publish them, they're just saying it's stupid. Also, there's a significant difference, at least by Western standards, of making fun of a person/people and making fun of the murder or mass murder of a person/people. They'd be the same horrified reaction to cartoons making light of the deaths of Iraqi and Afghani civilians, yet cartoons making light of a Judeo-Christian God are commonplace and usually considered inoffensive.

Yes, this. Just to clarify; I don't think Holocaust Denial should be a crime and I'm not saying this site should be taken down either. I simply made a thread about it.

FReedom of speech??

What about the same people killing countless number of Palestinians ruthlessly, wickdly??? Its another thing that no cartoons were puvlished as this would have tarnished the evil image of the zionists even more.

People need to wake up- especially in the west. I am a half caste as my mother is white but father is a muslim so see things from two different perspective and trust me the west are not giving a positive image of themselves.

The isrealis are breaking every law that has ever been passed and yet no action is taken against them are we, the western country back them??

We back innocent people getting KILLED?  

And then a minor thing occrs to the zionist country and the world throws a fit...where is the justice????????

Err... what? My point was that there is freedom of speech, hence people can publish these cartoons, but it doesn't stop them being stupid or offensive. And I wouldn't call the Holocaust a "minor thing". Nor are innocent people being killed relevant to this thread.

Typical western response. There is no point in trying to back the innocent and highlighting the evil because people are just brain washed against muslims. THis is the root of the problem.

Obviously it isnt relevent- muslims being killed is irrelevent.

Forget it- no point to xplain on Islam bashing Tsr!

Seriously what are you ten? I suggest you read something (anything) about Judaism, Zionism, the Israeli-Palestine conflict, the Holocaust and what constitutes an ethnicity (hint its nothing to do with religion).

No, there is a point, if you do it in a thread about that. Taking over a thread about something else and making it about that is not ok though.

You know whats really embarrassing (aside from your post)? Is that people of your ilk always talk about people shouting "anti-semitism!" in order to stop debate and look what you've done, you've just shouted "Islamophobia!" to halt debate. It has nothing to do with what Israel is doing. Freedom of speech to insult the Muhammed and freedom of speech to doubt the Holocaust must be maintained. It's not a "typical" response from a Westerner, its a response from someone who supports the freedom of speech. And, quite honestly, if you claim to be indicative of a response that isn't from the "West" then I am grateful that we have developed.

Now if I was to use your retarded logic, I would ask you politely to take down that British flag but I wont, because I'm not retarded.

The spiel is OK (questioning the Holocaust in itself is not a bad thing - just as we question the circumstances of all historical events) but the use of satirical cartoons to do so is outrageous, and obviously has nothing to do with thinking and more to do with just attacking political enemies

Out of interest, why are you talking about muslims? The Qu'ran doesn't state to draw offensive pictures of Jews, and to most reasonable people this whole sorry affair has nothing to do with Islam.

I truly hope that the Iranian government takes down this organisation, some of those pictures are very insulting, if they want to question the holocaust there are more proficient means to do so.

I've started threads about Cameroon, Pakistan (twice), India, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Most of my posts are in topics about the Arab-Israeli conflict (overwhelmingly) - just click all my posts, it wont take you long to work out. The only thread I've made that you can link to Islam is the veiled woman being refused off a bus - which is not exactly unsympathetic to the Islam point of view.

Ok I guess I didn't phrase this properly sorry, now looking back on it, i'm not sure really because i do not know what zionism consists of.

anyway on the basis of this thread, no this is not about islam vs zionism at all and i never meant this in the first place, what i was attempting to imply is judging from the responses of the thread, which drogue correctly said you get strong supporters of islam and zionism but anyway what this iranian institution is doing is appalling and stupid.
 
 
This calls for some 2006 anti-Denmark scale protests and effigy burnings. Who's in?

I have no sympathy with Iran or Israel.

If this is supposed to be a show of strength by Iran then it has failed drastically.

It does, and it has an Islamic constitution.

A lot of Muslims seem to have this Platonic notion of an Islamic state which seemingly has not existed for hundreds of years. It's silly, no country will ever be like 7th century Arabia, ever again. So if countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia which clearly have Islam and Shariah playing a big part of their legal system and government, then what exactly would an Islamic state look like in the 21st century?

It's just a no true scottsman thing.

Not all of them. Therefore it is an Islamic Republic, not an Islamic State. Iran is not an Islamic state nor does it claim to be hence the title of Islamic Republic.

*Sigh* fine make up your own definition of an Islamic State if you wish. You might as well throw Pakistan in there while you are at it.

It calls itself the Islamic Republic of Iran, and states that it was founded upon the basis of an Islamic revolution. Its supreme leaders are Ayatollahs and all legislation has to pass through an Islamic approval body.

It does consider itself an Islamic state. Whether it actually fulfills what it originally set out to be is a different matter.

IMO it is more of an autocracy that tries to gain its support from religion than actually being a religious state. But that does not mean that it does not consider itself an Islamic state.

Being Arab and African is not mutually exclusive. Nor is being White and African. Are you questioning the Africanness of the continent's ethnic minorities such as the Indians and the Europeans - many of whom are proudly African? It seems your notion of Africanness is 'black'. Is your notion of Europeaness 'white'?

Firstly, this cartoon is not particularly related to Zionist Jews. Do you know what Zionism is?

Secondly, "everyone" is not "throwing a tantrum". The only discussion I have seen on the topic is a thread of dubious quality on an online student message board. No rioting in the streets. No violence. No threats to kill. And no deaths. Comparing this restrained reaction to a WHOLE WEBSITE of cartoons to the apoplectic spasms of hate-fuelled violence unleashed in reaction to two cartoons about Islam is absurd. As are you.

Regarding free speech, the holocaust is obviously an extremely delicate matter for many. Personally, as a non-Jew but a phil-semite, I believe it should not be against the law to publically question the holocaust, nor for that matter to publically question anything. It's only through debate and the exchange of opinions that bad ideas and mistaken beliefs can be exposed. Hushing up a debate is only food for the conspiracy theorists, nutjobs and cranks.

Fine then it is an Islamic State. I don't know its government structure as well as I know Iran's, but I am pretty sure that Pakistan's government is not restricted by the religion as much as Iran's is.

I don't really view it as a criticism to call a state a religious state.

Israel is a Jewish State.
England is a Christian State.

etc

Not that you can apply the same criteria for a Christian State and an Islamic State.

Pretty pathetic attempt at Jewish supremacy mate.

Just to further specify your already rather retarded measure of worth, Israel has only 9 Nobel prizes - yet you count Jews so you quote the figure of 180. Yet instead of counting Persians by ethnicity due to the Persian diaspora, you count the meagre 2 that have been awarded to Iranians, and ignore all Arab laureates. Either compare Israelis with Iranians or Jews with Persians. Quoting the highest figure for Jews and the lowest figure for Persians, by only looking at modern day Iranians, is a riduculous measure of comparison.

KK please give us stats for all the nobel laureates of Persian origin. If you are going to go on a little tirade you might as well back yourself up with some figures.

Firstly, untwist your knickers, darling.

Secondly, when I originally posted I made a point of saying that totting up the amounts of laureates was not an accurate measure of 'national'/'racial' or any other worth, but the statistics were interesting nevertheless. I haven't changed my mind.

From what I remember I did acknowledge laureates from states with Arab populations including Palestine, Algeria and Egypt. I don't doubt I may have missed some others.

If you wish to go through the list that I linked to in order to draw up and post a list of Persian diaspora laureates, you are more than welcome to do so. But I'll wager that even if you added the amount of Persian/Persian diaspora laureates to the amount Arab/Arab diaspora laureates and then multiplied it by your IQ, the resulting figure would still fall well short of 180. Plus, we should not forget the differences in populations - 10 million Jews including diaspora, compared to 65 million Persians excluding diaspora, and over 350 million Arabs.

All the best.

Missed this bit of slander first time around. Why would you assume that?

I am more than happy to acknowledge the scientific and mathematical contribution that the region can boast of: the translation and preservation of the classics of the Ancient World, as well as the original work. However, as the Persian heyday was seven or eight hundred years before the first Nobel Prize was awarded, I fail to see the relevance of this to my post.

"...and then multiplied it by your IQ"... how witty.  

And it's " number of Persian/Persian diaspora laureates", not " amount of Persian/Persian diaspora laureates"; same for Arab laureates - as 'laureates' is a quantitative noun.

The rest is replied to below:

The relevance of the post is to show how stupid it is to promote racial supremacy or inferiority on the basis of Nobel Prizes because, as you have just mentioned, the "Persian heyday was seven or eight hundred years before the first Nobel Prize was awarded".

And lol at your slander of crediting the Persians with only preservation of the classics of the Ancient World.  

I'm not going to reply to your tacit and implied racism bud. Believe what you want... and thanks again for the neg-rep.

Well, first of all, and I quote:

Post #13 "O dear that devalues Mr Arafat's gong, and he constituted 25% of Arab input, by my count." Teadrinker

Now, if you follow my maths, this means I acknowledged four Arab laureates (who, thanks to your grammar lesson, I shall no longer consider a glutenous stew). Like I said earlier, I didn't put too much care into my counting so It is likely I missed some more - please let me know if you find any.

Take care.

 

Your claim that I was promoting "racial superiority" is just downright silly. In my original post I said that the statistics were:

"A flawed measure of worth, but interesting all the same."

In my most recent post I further clarified that:

"totting up the amounts of laureates was not an accurate measure of 'national'/'racial' or any other worth, but the statistics were interesting nevertheless."

I will leave it to more sensible members of the forum to decide if I was "promoting racial superiority".

Well I hooked you on that one! If you re-read it you will find I also credit their original work. (note the last 6 words):

"the translation and preservation of the classics of the Ancient World, as well as the original work"

I thought I'd reference it second, as I knew you'd immediately blow a self-righteous gasket at the reference to the (equally important) preservation of the ancient texts.

I wouldn't want to blow my own racially superior trumpet, but my my, I really know how to push your buttons, don't I! You're too easy to wind up. Chill out, make yourself a sandwich or something, and stop being such a sensitive boy.

And the negrep! no worries. That was in response to the first post you ever addressed to me. It was on the 'right to an opinion thread' and your post which I thought was rather sub-standard, was about the merits of Everton football club. I saw it as off-topic, that was all.

If you look at his posts, not just in this thread, and other messages he sends, you'd understand. I'm not trying to prove it to others or there would be other evidence I'd bring forward.

Now you're turning from the over-sensitive to the downright weird.

I too checked some of my posts in case I'd posted something that could be misinterpreted, but other than my tendency towards pettiness and being a sub-standard contrarian, I really fail to see what you're on about.

I can't remember posting anything on an Israel thread - and in respect to the OP I will not turn this thread into one. I do recall saying at one point that I was a phil-semite (I like Jewish music and literature!) but as you well know that does not mean I am anti-Palestine.

You aren't still sulking about my negrepping your 'Everton are ****' post are you?? I'd take it back if I could, I in no way meant to upset you.

I'd very much appreciate an answer as your accusation was quite uncalled for.

See for example South Africa's  Aaron Klug  (Chemistry),  Sydney Brenner  (Biology),  Nadine Gordimer  (Literature) or Algeria's  Claude Cohen-Tannoudji  (Physics).

Who ever said Africans were a worthless group of morons? At least the Jews of Africa have proved that one wrong.
 
 
To the white man, the value of race is determined by the prizes they receive from the white man's hand.

Well I'd argue that if the Shah hadn't been such an uncomprimising dictator, we wouldn't have been landed with the Mullahs  

But I see your point, he was definitely far less brutal and he didn't completely destroy the country's economy...

I've actually frequently heard, especially from the class I recently took about the Middle East in Global Politics, that one of the Shah's main flaws was his weakness. The fact that he didn't want to order the military to put down the 79 revolution being one example. And this weakness was a stark contrast to his father.

I mean you probably know more about him than I do, considering that I learned this from an Iranian LSE prof whose family was obviously linked to the Shah's government. But the Shah really seemed well-intentioned. Obviously the whole use of the secret police was bad, but the White Revolution seemed pretty sane.

A lot more sane than Khomeini, Khamenei, and Ahmad..

Well the fact that the Shah allowed the CIA and MI6 overthrow the only democratically elected Prime Minister Iran ever had (Dr Mossadegh) to consolidate his own grip on power really shows his dictatorial nature. That's not even going into the Rastakhiz Party and all that.

You could say that the Shah recognized that the best way for Iran to modernize was through US and British help.

Hence Mossadegh's alienation of the West through his nationalization programs would have harmed Iran, in the Shah's eyes.

Not at all, since the only "help" the US or Britain were prepared to give was bolstering the Shah's army...Britain wouldn't even give a fair deal to Iranians for Iranian oil, they simply wanted to turn Iran into another colony, and Shah was complicit in this.

The West (well MI6 and the CIA at any rate) should have realised that Iran as an independent nation has every right not to have its natural resources exploited and stolen by foreign companies.

That isn't exactly true. There is a reason why the law that allowed foreign nationals not to be prosecuted under Iranian law caused such a massive outcry. It was because there were so many American and British businessmen in Tehran.

US and British aid and linkages to Iran were much deeper than just military. The same with US aid to Saudi Arabia and Israel currently.

Democratic governments are voted in by people from their own country. The first duty of any democratic government is to meet the national security needs of its own people. Obviously there is a moral argument against abusing another country, but if it benefits your own people and is deemed necessary then a government should have no qualms doing it.

Mind you, the US and Britain should have anticipated the massive backlash that was to come in 79, and is boiling in Egypt and Saudi Arabia currently. It could be argued that the hatred now a days is a larger risk to US and British needs than high oil prices, but hindsight is everything.
