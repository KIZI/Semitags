"The Report from last night`s match v Forest Green Rovers is NOT on the official Exeter City F.C. site !!!" How come Ant ? Still shell shocked like me, that we could let FGR come back twice ?  What worries me most is the apparent drop in attendances already, I know Liverpool were on TV last night BUT it wasn`t a frosty January night at SJP was it !  Any thoughts. Min - any printable thoughts ?
