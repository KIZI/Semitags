Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada first thought he could
scrape his way to re-election by invoking his power as majority
leader and reminding voters what that means for his home state.
When that didn't seem to work, he thought he could pull out this
election with a scorched-earth campaign aimed at his Republican
opponent, Sharron Angle, a Tea Party candidate with a rich history
of unorthodox statements and politically unpopular positions.

But as two new polls this week showed the candidates effectively
tied yet again, it appears increasingly likely that Reid's fortunes
may ultimately turn on the weapon he has long boasted of: a
sophisticated voter turnout operation that he has methodically
built since President Barack Obama ran in Nevada two years ago.

On the eve of the only debate of this contest, and as early
voting begins Saturday -- a two-week period in which 50 percent of
Nevadans are expected to cast ballots -- Reid finds himself trapped
in the race he has, in many ways, always feared. Angle, an opponent
his campaign had viewed as the most flawed on the Republican bench,
has not only held her own but has become a national symbol of the
Tea Party attempt to upend politics in Washington.

The Angle campaign reported this week that it had raised $14.3
million in the third quarter of this year, bringing her fundraising
total to about $17.8 million. Reid has not yet reported his take,
but his aides made clear that despite extensive efforts, he would
fall well short of Angle's haul. Going into the third quarter, he
had raised about $19.2 million.

On top of the money contributed directly to Angle, independent
groups supporting her spent at least $2.5 million between early
July and early October, according to the media monitoring service
CMAG. Groups supporting Reid spent about $3.2 million during the
same period. What that all means is that Angle -- who Reid had once
assumed would be at a significant financial disadvantage to him,
given his fundraising prowess as the Democratic leader -- may have
at the very least nearly erased his financial advantage.

For all the money gushing through the state, aides to both
candidates described the central question of the race in similar
terms: whether the intensity of Angle's supporters, and their
dislike of Reid -- a statement from Angle's campaign boasting of the
fundraising take talked about the "the hatred of Harry Reid" --
would be enough to overcome the incumbent's get-out-the-vote
operation

Since Angle defeated a field of better-known mainstream
candidates in the Republican primary, the two campaigns and outside
groups have spent at least $15.5 million on television commercials,
a huge amount given the cost of TV time in Nevada.

Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling, said
Reid's biggest challenge has been to get voters to view this as a
choice between two candidates, rather than a judgment on Reid.

"My sense all along is at the end of the day this is a
referendum on Reid," Coker said. "No matter how kooky they try to
portray Angle, I think at the end of the day, people, if they have
to make a choice between the lesser of two evils, they'll vote
against Harry Reid."
