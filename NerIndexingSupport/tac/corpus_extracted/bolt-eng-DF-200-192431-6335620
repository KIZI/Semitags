 
 
Ukraine's Got Talent winner. (Beautiful)
 
 
This moved me to tears. I just thought I'd share it with you:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=518XP8prwZo 
 
 
If only stuff like that were on the British version, rather than the dancing flamingos and what-have-you...
 
 
And the guy juggling watermelons on fire is where?
 
 
Wow!

Simply amazing!
 
 
You cried at someone drawing in sand. I feel sorry for you.
 
 
Yeah that is pretty amazing. I just wish she'd smiled a bit.

Or done it nude, whatever.

It isn't just somebody drawing in sand; just like Van Gogh's work isn't just somebody putting paint on a canvas. And plus I have Ukrainian roots, which obviously makes it all the more poignant. Please don't be so insensitive. I liked it anyway, just wanted to share  
 
 
Incredible.
 
 
wow
 
 
What can I say, my country is beautiful.

Break it down and you'll see that it is somebody painting on a canvas. Break it down and you'll see that it is somebody drawing in sand.
 
 
  Incredible.
 
 
omg, that's awesome

Yes, it's drawing in sand, but it's the story that it tells that's moving.

Or did you not notice that bit?
 
 
  thats pretty awesome!
 
 
wow

their talent is better than ours

Beautiful. I can totally understand why people cried.
 
 
Quite stunning, who'd have thought such a tragic and poignant story could be told through the medium of sand
 
 
That was pretty amazing, I don't normally find myself drawn in by stuff like this, but I made an exception this time

That is beautiful, thanks for sharing.
 
 
Was it just me who was hoping for an 18 year-old Ukranian pole-dancer?

wow. amazing.

and the woman is purty too.
 
 
I say Ukraine and you say talent...

Ukraine's got talent...

It's the DJ...

SHEVCHENKO!!!  
 
 
Incredible.
 
 
This is actually beautiful, thanks OP

i especially love the music starting at the 6:10 mark, classical adaptation of Metallica - Nothing Else Matters, so good   if you know the words to the original version of the song, it's scarily relevant to the subject matter of the story she's telling, incredible
 
 
Aww, wow. Any time I've tried something similar it's just ended up a big sandy mess   And the story was beautiful and moving. Why can't we have someone like that on BGT for a change dammit :P
 
 
I thought it was this:
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jxTC...layer_embedded 
 
 
That was actually brilliant, really awe-inspiring. beautiful stuff  
 
 
wow !!!! amazing !!!
 
 
Simply amazing...so beautiful.

Makes our BGT look **** (which it is).
 
 
that was amazing

It was Apocalyptica covering Metallica; I think there was another piece of theirs used earlier as well. Pretty good choice.

I was expecting some generic crap but I was genuinely blown away.

Technically you can't say period and then end it with a full stop. I could just say that it doesn't make sense full stop.
 
 
Incredible!
 
 
wow, that's real talent.

Break it down and you'll find the most beautiful novel is just squiggles.

Break it down and you'll see the the pioneering heart-surgeon is just cells.

If that is all you find in life, I am glad I am not you.

That video is truly stunning. Thank you for sharing, OP.
 
 
That's amazing. Left me speechless. Better than the crappy dance troupes we have here.

Yup. Pessimism results in good surprises and always being right.
 
 
I understood it's meaning, and I watched it all. But I can't say it moved me greatly, perhaps I'm not emotionally intelligent enough.
 
 
That was seriously cool!
 
 
Wow, that's pretty cool. Much more original than the crap we get over here.

Apocalyptica. They did a whole album of Metallica stuff (Apocalyptica Plays Metallica) and it sends shivers down your spine. I love Metallica and Apocalyptica's take on classic songs like Nothing Else Matters and Master of Puppets is nothing short of genius. Get the album, you won't regret it!

As for the video, what more can be said than wow! That is just incredible, I have forwarded it onto all my mates, that is just an incredible piece of art and an actual talent...which is sorely missing in our version. Well except Susan Boyle who was actually quite good, but the rest were useless. What this girl in the sane has though, is infinitely better than Susan Boyle, just the poise, poignancy and accuracy is truly remarkable.

The Ukranians dancing is pretty good, watch these kick off.

What does the writing say at the end?

I agree is was beatiful.
 
 
That is such a beautiful talent! I cant be moved to tears such as Ukranians who it affected the most but it still tells an emotional story through a medium that I could have never imagined!

Thank you OP for sharing this!
 
 
That was epic

What story is she telling?

That's because it is aimed at the Ukrainians. Remeber 1/3 Ukrainians were killed in the war. So this is bound to affect them.
 
 
whts happeneing when they cry?
 
 
That was one of the most amazing youtube videos I have ever watched.. At some bits I was just amazed at how precise the details were
 
 
They get a long time to do their acts, don't they?
 
 
Amazing talent, a pleasure to watch.

the story of quite a large proportion of families in her country during the difficult times of war; obviously my knowledge of ukraine's (or any) history is close to nothing, but it's still such a moving act  
 
 
My god she's good.

That was me being facetious.
 
 
Really Awesome! Wow!
 
 
Wow Incredible, true talent.
 
 
Whoa that was beautiful.
 
 
Wow, amazing. Must have been brilliant for the Ukrainians.
 
 
WOW.

She's amazing! Thats real talent, very worthy winner  
 
 
She won because of

POLITICS

If her sand story was about anything else, she would be 2nd.

Provoking and beautifully executed.
 
 
At first I was like  

Then I was like  

And it ended with  
 
 
This is what you call talent, not britains got talent, all those damn singers
 
 
Wow.
 
 
Wow.

I don't think i have ever sat through a 8 min video on youtube before...
That's a talent she's got.
 
 
Amazing.
 
 
Thanks for this post, that was really cool. I've never seen anything like it  
 
 
It's ruskiiii not ukranian, still... pretty much twins  

EDIT: The clear signs that it's russian for starters is that ukranians didn't even have a navy in 1945.

Break life down and we'll see that you're nothing more than an oddly arranged collection of cosmic dust, soon to be obliterated.  
 
 
Is that some apocalpytica playing at the end I hear?
 
 
Awesome, just amazing.
 
 
Amazing!
 
 
 Even more incredible sand animation 

WOW
 
 
Ouch I've never seen anything so good with so much meaning on a talent competition....

Apparently means 'You are always near'.

I read that, and bawled.  

By the way, has anyone seen  her other video  ?

Its what they are drawing in sand.

ITs the humble begginings torn apart by the war and at the end the separation of family.
 
 
so old.
 
 
  that was simply terrific.
 
 
thats cool!!
 
 
Words fail to describe how awesome this is.
Thanks for posting it

EDIT: Is the story she is trying to tell (based on) a true story?

As far as I can tell, yes. The characters aren't necessarily real people, but she is demonstrating the real effects of WW2 on ordinary Ukrainian citizens.
 
 
Wow!
 
 
stunning.
 
 
So good!  
 
 
Damn, I was not expecting that, I though Ukrainians were cabbage people.
 
 
Very impressive.

I was going to neg you until my mind was taken off the impulse by reading your profile:

2006-2007: Received the Brevet des Collèges, which is the equivalent to GCSE's.

2007-2008: Self-taught myself French(Edexcel) at IGCSE level, where I received an A*.

How did you manage the Brevet without knowing French to, at least, IGCSE-level? Did you really have anything to teach yourself?  
 
 
Oh wow.   That really moved me... especially the end, to tears. Stunning.
 
 
I thought it was amazing, much better than the stuff you get in BGT.

The message at the end 'You are always near' was very fitting. Ukraine lost something like 20-30% of it population in WW2, her art serves to ensure the lost will always be remembered.

So because you think it's beautiful, anyone who doesn't should 'piss off'? I don't think it's beautiful and I think a lot of people are probably just saying it is because it's supposed to be.

But I won't judge.

Well true, I more or less just sat the exam on the spot.

I finished the written exam in 7 mins it was that easy.
 
 
That was amazing, thanks for sharing OP (pos rep)
 
 
Erm, yeah its a pretty remarkable talent, but it hardly made me cry.
 
 
Damn lol - didn't there was such a form of art
