Burnley captain Steven Caldwell is one of four players released by the Clarets
in the aftermath of their relegation from the Premier League.

Scotland defender Caldwell has struggled with injuries this season and made just
13 appearances before being told he can look for a new club.

Midfielder Stephen Jordan will also leave Turf Moor, while goalkeeper Nicky
Weaver and youngster Adam Kay complete the list of players let go by boss Brian
Laws.

Clarets' player-coach Graham Alexander is set to play on until he is 40 after
signing a new two-year deal, with defender Clarke Carlisle extending his stay by
the same length of time.

Brian Jensen, Michael Duff, Robbie Blake and Steven Thompson have also been
offered new contracts.

Laws said: "There have been some tough choices to make but I would like to place
on record my thanks to the released players for their hard work and commitment
to the club."
