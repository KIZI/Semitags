We just bought a house (or are in the process). How much is a good price for a home inspection? What did everyone here pay? Please and thank you in advance.
 
 
400 in Seattle
 
 
Ours was $1000.
 
 
 
Ours was $1000.
 

Whoa - seriously??
Ours was $375 in Phoenix. Not sure if size of home matters but ours is 2750 sq ft and has a pool.
 
 
about $375 in Seattle around 2007.
 
 
I want to say $300, but it has been 3 years.
 
 
$400 for regular in Los Angeles, and we opted for a plumbing with video fo another $200.
 
 
Between $400 and $500 in Mississippi
 
 
$300-350, Texas, 2007, 2600sf.
Price will vary by location, size of home, etc.
 
 
300 in Kansas, circa 2007. I think they run 5-600 here.
 
 
450 in Vancouver bc
 
 
$400 - 450 in 2010 in Seattle. (DH and I disagree on the #)
 
 
Chicago suburbs in 2008 was $350
We also had our basement tested for radon that was $250
 
 
I don't remember exactly it was somewhere between $200-$300. In Metro-Detroit in 2007.
 
 
Rigth around $300 and then another $100 for radon.
 
 
I think $475 for everything including radon and termite--termites were a second person.
 
 
$325 for home inspection and radon inspection. The seller does the pest inspection, so I can't help there.
 
 
325 in Buffalo.
 
 
$550 for the house
$50 for the detached garage
$150 for the radon testing
Boston
 
 
500 in RI
 
 
$400 outside of Boston, included radon testing. We ended up needing a pest inspection for a VA loan, I think it was $75 or so.
 
 
$400, I think.
 
 
$400 Iowa
 
 
ours was somewhere between $400 and $600 in VA.
 
 
Ours was $300 in 2010, 2500 sq ft in Denver. But I know we got a discount because our inspector gives referrals from my realtor a break, so I think regular price is $350 for him.
 
 
Mine was $375 in Seattle just last week.
 
 
450 MCOL
 
 
$450 in Detroit
$250 for the basement radon testing
$200 plumbing snake from house to street with video check
 
 
$350 in southern california. our inspector's price list showed $300-500 for general inspections in our metro area depending on the size of the house.
 
 
We paid $800 altogether in Fairfield County, CT: $450 property, $100 radon, plus another $250 for the septic. Thank goodness we got good news all around!
