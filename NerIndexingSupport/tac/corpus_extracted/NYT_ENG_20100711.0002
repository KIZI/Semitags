Advance for Sunday, July 11 Eds.: Future tour stops include Salt Lake City; Las Vegas; Oakland, Calif.; Anaheim, Calif. James Taylor, Carole King bring their 'intimate' show to arenas      Between the two of them, James Taylor and Carole King defined
much of the music that came out of the '60s and '70s.

One listen to their most recent disc, "Live at the Troubadour"
-- the inspiration behind their current tour -- and it's impossible
to dodge the hit songs.

Some of King's classics were written for '60s vocal groups,   la
"Will You Love Me Tomorrow" and "Up on the Roof." Taylor's
catalog helped define the singer-songwriter genre in the late-'60s
and early-'70s, such as "Something in the Way She Moves" and
"Fire and Rain." Another song, "You've Got a Friend," was
penned by King and made popular by Taylor.

The Troubadour experience, recorded in 2007 in Los Angeles but
released earlier this year, was a telling reunion for Taylor and
King.

"What was lovely about the CD and DVD, we had not had a whole
lot of rehearsals before we went back into that situation," King
said recently. "We got together, and we had a day or two to
rehearse it. What people are seeing is a reconnection that is raw.
It's still new and fresh and almost tentative in a way. It's fully
present in one way. In another way, we hadn't settled into how we
were going to do it."

Taylor agrees: "We were experiencing the surprise and delight
of it as much as the audience," he said. "The place was so
packed. Everyone was standing. They took the chairs and tables out
of the place. It had that sense of what its feels like to be in
that close and crowded and intimate club."

Taylor and King are touring the U.S. to celebrate the music that
made their careers, and we chatted with them about their
intertwined history, their "intimate" arena shows and their
shared love of backing each other up.

QUESTION: How have the shows been going?

James Taylor: We've been on the road since March. It's been
great -- spectacular on all levels, artistically and in terms of the
reception by the public.

Q: How are you two pulling off this intimate show in these big
rooms -- arenas and such?

Carole King: It's actually remarkable how well it's working.
Initially when we were talking about arenas, both of us were
horrified because an arena doesn't sound like it could be intimate.
But James came up with the idea of doing it in the round so nobody
is more than a half an arena away. We teamed up with a set designer
so it's designed to look like a club with lamps and banquettes to
suggest a club atmosphere, and with that, it just works.

We can feel as intimate as the shows get with just James and me
playing. Everyone in the highest seats is on stage with us.

JT: We approached it by using a lot of video so that every seat
in the house is given a front-row seat. So we and the crew, who is
amazing and puts this thing up every night, can pull it off.

Q: Would you say you've recreated the Troubadour stage for this
big tour?

CK: Maybe not "recreate" the Troubadour stage but suggested
it.

Q: When did you two technically meet -- in the late '60s or the
early '70s?

CK: If you count 1970 as the '60s, we met in the '60s.

Q: Carole, is it true that it was James who first encouraged you
to get out there on your own and sing?

CK: It is true. He didn't just encourage me. He said, "You're
going to sing 'Up on the Roof' tonight." He had no idea of the
monster he was creating.

Q: Where was that?

CK: Queens College, my alma mater.

Q: James, do you remember the moment that made you ask her to
get up there?

JT: It was a sense that Carole had behind her a decade of
writing some of the most classic songs in pop culture, and this was
really a thing that was waiting to happen -- for Carole to come
forward and put these songs out in her own voice. It's true she had
a hit record in the '60s, so it wasn't the first time she had taken
a stab at it. But I definitely remember feeling it was something
that was waiting to happen. It was an energy that felt like it
needed to be connected.

Q: And now you two are connecting that original energy via this
tour. Are you enjoying yourselves?

CK: I'm so excited. I'm having the most amazing time doing this
show with the band members. The core of it is James and me, and
every night I get to hear "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" with James'
guitar and the magic comes in and sings, "When the night meets the
morning sun." It's moments like that ...

JT: One of the things that makes this such a reunion is we're
out with the original band -- Danny Kortchmar, Russ Kunkel and Lee
Sklar. Danny Kortchmar on guitar, he introduced us. All those guys
played on our early tours, and so we have an extensive history with
those guys. So it's a deep reunion in that sense.

Q: James, what's your favorite song of Carole's that she's
singing on this tour?

JT: I'd have to answer in a number of different categories.
There are songs that I love because the audience connects with them
so deeply, like "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" gives me such a
sweetheart feeling. It's a pitch over the center of the plate. ...
But I've also been enjoying playing "Sweet Seasons" and that
Curtis Mayfield rhythm part of it.

Carole and I are both on stage the whole time. She'll play a
couple of songs. I'll play a couple of songs. We alternate, and
each of us plays about a dozen or so songs. It gives me a chance to
step back and be a member of the band and part of the audience.

CK: When I get to play backup for James, I love it. For the
audience, there's the element you can't define. It's the joy that
after 40 years of songs, it's not just one-plus-one. It's the three
cats, Russ and Danny and Lee, and they're driving us to play better
and harder and giving us, at the same time, that foundation to fly
from.

Q: How much of this show is about nostalgia?

JT: A lot of it is. It takes people back to a point in time.
It's mainly about an audience's connection with these songs, Carole
and me as performers, and where that all sits with their lives. A
good deal of it -- maybe nostalgia is not the right word -- but it
resonates at the front of our mind.

CK: The surprising thing, and I was just remarking to James
about this, is the increasing number of younger people that we're
seeing in the audience. We've heard for a long time, "Your music
is the soundtrack to our life." But now we're starting to hear
that from the children and grandchildren of our generation, and
they're embracing it in numbers that are so satisfying to us.
