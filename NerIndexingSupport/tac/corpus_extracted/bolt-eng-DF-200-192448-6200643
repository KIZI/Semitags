In light of the recent terrorist attacks, is your attitude towards the BNP more benvolent?
 
 
Why would tanyone be more favourable? Everyone saw these attacks coming..
 
 
hell no...the BNP insight the kind of attitudes which make ppl want to cause terrorist attacks
 
 
the poll options seem to suggest everyone starts from an "unfavourable" position.
 
 
No. I still don't like the BNP aand I'm not sure of anything that would get me to change this opinion.

And Nick Griffin is being prosecuted for talking about it and putting the blame where it belongs. Respect increased, he was only about 10 miles out in his prediction of where the filth would hail from.

No he is prosecuted for inciting violence and hatred...saying he is being prosecuted wrongly would only come from a bigot..

Everyone knew London would be attacked by terrorists, probably on the Underground, as it is a perfect target. The Prime Minister and other leading figures said so months ago.

The problem with Griffin is not his prediction, but his disgusting comments on Islam and Muslims.
 
 
Definitely not! IMO that would be letting the terrorists win!

Maybe you know better than me, can you give us the quotes.

I thought a significant part of the prosecutions argument is that he quotes the Quran and says Muslims believe in it's incitements to violence and hatred. If it's not a political prosecution surely all the Imams who quote the Quran, would be prosecuted too.

1. Not once in the "secreat agent" programme did he say anything abpout violence
2.He is being prosecuted wrongly because he is being prosecuted for "incitment to racial hatred" and he did not say anything about any race.

 
saying he is being prosecuted wrongly would only come from a bigot
 

Nice way to force your will on people, anyone who disagrees with you on this is now a bigot.

P.S ANTOHER BNP THREAD!!! do you guys have dreams about us or something?

That's not what a chav is. I find it a suprising that you don't know what one is seeing as you try to behave smart on this forum defending your racist attitudes and contradicting yourself many times.

I think Griffin makes an error when he turns to the Quran to explain the animus which motivates some youths to rape non-Muslim girls (I see it as misogyny and racism), but it's an error based on his reading of the Quran, and I don't think he incites people to hate and violence, he's pointing out the incitements to same within Islamic teaching.

Quotes please to show his unjustified comments on Muslims and Islam, I suspect his comments are based on the Quran and Hadiths?

This wicked, vicious faith has expanded through a handful of cranky lunatics about 1,300 years ago until it is now sweeping country after country,” Griffin said.

He told the meeting that in the Koran, “you will find verse after verse after verse which says that you can take any woman you want as long as they are not Muslim women.”

"If they get a non-Muslim girl and they get her pregnant, then her community doesn't want her and the child generally grows up a Muslim. And that's the way that this wicked, vicious faith has expanded."

Muslims know their own faith, Griffin doesn't. Any Muslim could tell you that these are dispicable lies.

If he's factually incorrect, he's just factually incorrect about some historical details or in his understanding of a religious text, big deal.

I doubt that Islam was spread by the impregnation of infidels as he says, but you'd probably complain if he said it was spread through military conquest which is more or less true.

And he doesn't incite hatred or violence--though the Quran [and the Jewish Talmud] do, should we prosecute Rabbis and Imams? Or should we have freedom of speech and conscience?
 
 
My answer to the thread's question: a simple 'definitely not'.
 
 
 
“ you will find verse after verse after verse which says that you can take any woman you want as long as they are not Muslim women.”
 

He says it as if hes read the Quran cover to cover. Probably doesn't even know what a copy looks like

I thought it was only about 200 pages.
 
 
Apparantly there was a big rape wave in what is now called bangledesh in 1947. But its true that islam in general did not spread by rape, it mainly spread via killing people.

How does the length of it make a difference to whether or not Griffin has actually read it. My copy is closer to 900 pages. But it depends on the page size/font size obviously.
 
 
It does not matter what he said about islam, islam is not a race hence charging him for "incitment to racial hatred" is wrong. If you can get charged for "incitment to racial hatred" when talking about islam, then why are they bothering to bring out the "incitment to religious hatred" law?

Nick Griffin is not dead. You know ****
 
 
The attacks in no way did or could change my opinion towards the BNP. Although I was shocked by the attacks (yes there was always the chance it would happen but it doesn't wear off the shock) but it doesn't make me suddenly think that immigrants are bad people or that Islam is an evil thing.
You can get rid of muslims, all middle eastern people, hell even all people who aren't white English. People'll still attack each other, we always find a reason to hate (I know there are some incredibly kind, decent people who this won't apply to).

My love of a multicultural and mixed-race society where people can all have their own ways and beliefs still prevails.

Based on the comments that I am aware of, I believe the charges are a serious threat to free speech and entirely political. Another example of a totalitarian Labour government. Of course, if you think they are inciting hatred, Id be happy to see that demonstrated.

Back but very busy at work I'm afraid. It'll take a couple of days to get everything under control here in the office before I can devote my normal energies to UKL.....so bear with me!!

Excellent vacation (Aushwitz isn't the top of the list for most tourist sights but very interesting nevertheless!!)

PS: I didn't venture near London (you know my dislike of the place)
 
 
the bnp are growing as whites are waking up to the FACT they are second class citizens in their own country. weirdly enough its not blacks and muslims etc taking away free speech its white middle class liberial cowardice scum like blair kennedy and the politically correct politicians who force us to be ''proud'' of multiculturalism

Never heard so much **** in my life. Second class citizens?? Are you mad.
 
 
sorry is that provoking hatred against white middle class 'liberal' scum
no didnt hear any shouts of racist there perhaps antiwhite racism doesnt matter any more cus white people DONT MATTER.BE PROUD OF OUR 'LOVELY'MULTICULTI-BRITAIN OR ELSE ILL SEND ROUND THE PC POLICE ARMED WITH SQUASHED BANANAS-cus thats all they will alowed to carry cus the law is on the side of the criminal not on the side of the victim.
to be honest my views were more favourable of the bnp before the incidents because they were the ones telling us that there was terrorism happening elsewhere and the likelyhood was it was going to happen here.
as for the bnp spreading hatred-WHAT THE HATRED OF TERRORISM?
not all extremists are shavenheaded white 30 something males with right arms in the air shouting german nazi slogans. AS for ethnic cleansing white people in this country are being ethnically cleansed.
heres the really question-is the only allowed racism racism against whites?
as for inciting hatred ive seen more hatred of white people come out of the media then the bnp -you may question the relevance of this but why doesnt antiwhite racism matter and why is it ok for the government to discriminate against whites in fabvour of ethnic minorities. the funny thing is the biggest promoters of multi culturalism are usually uni grads that live in white leafy suburbia if they really love the multiracial/cultural utopia that is britain why dont they go and live in the terrace(not terrorist) houseswhere drugs and antisocial behaviour arent far away-the only multiculturalism they know is having the odd black/gay/jewish friends and having the odd take away.
another question the 'liberals' should answer: if multiculturalism is good why are there disadvantages to it that when ever they are raised the person who raises this question is silenced. this model of multiculturalism does not work- it should be one rule for all or not at all
 
 
what is positive discrimination then?- i call it institutionalised racial discrimination against whites
 
 
isnt it funny how the anti bnp amongst us call us racists, biggots, people who stir up hate and ignorant - YET THEY HATE STEREOTYPES AND PREJUDICE - or at least claim to
 
 
I obviously touched a nerve.. i'm not even gonna read all that ^^ Can't be assed to read another pile of rubbish.  
Later
 
 
i am happy you dont read that because that is the way the forces of the anti british anti white politicasl persuation acts-to ignore us BUT WE ARENT GOING AWAY.then theyll try and ban us and still we wont go away. OH dear you cant destroy the sentiments that whites are second class citizens in their own country- it seems one day you will have to deal with it because the ''far right'' anti immigration parties are growing.you cant defeat something just by banning it-look at holland and austria they couldnt ban the far right and even look at france the FN recieved near enough 20% of the vote in the presidencial vote in the second round of the presidential elections. not everyone is a fan of the EU,terorism political correctness- you cant deal with us or those and many other issues hence ignoring us and putting labels on us that are false just gives any opposition to the BNP a misguided name
 
 
Im sorry but I think this shows how BASIC your political views are

This poll is biased. 'No, my attitude towards the BNP is still unfavourable'. Sorry what?!?! 'unfavourable'. Damn right it's unfavourable. They are extreme facists just like the attackers. IMO there is no difference.

Oh my... Are you being serious. You are honestly sugesting that the BNP were the only party in Britain warning of terrorist attacks? ermmm.... No. sorry to ruin you're ignorant point of view but actually many parties were warning about terrorism. Many left groups predicted it. Hell ever Labour guessed it would happen.

the funny thing is the biggest promoters of multi culturalism are usually uni grads that live in white leafy suburbia if they really love the multiracial/cultural utopia that is britain why dont they go and live in the terrace(not terrorist) houseswhere drugs and antisocial behaviour arent far away-the only multiculturalism they know is having the odd black/gay/jewish friends and having the odd take away.

Stop being so ignorant. This idea is based entirely on simpleminded guessing. you have no idea whatsoever. Have you ever been on a anti racism march? There are lots of people on them who are white middle-aged, youth, elderly, basically every age. There are also many cultures on the marches not just 'non-white'. I sugest you open you're blinded eyes are take a look at the world.

What do you mean by fascists? Do you really hold equal contempt for a political party and a group of bombers--just because you don't like their political viewpoint? What does fascist mean again?  
 
 
Facism has no real meaning, First coined by Mussolini it was just the way of him adapting his views to suit the nation. Not really Bombers as such, more a political organisation.

The term fascist is ambigious, but generally points towards a mixing of extreme nationalism, moral ultra-conservatism, authortarianism, and a belief in domestic governmental intervention (which is sometimes quasi-socialistic with regards to the economy). Fascism often comes hand in hand with racism and aggresive foreign policy, though one can be a fascist without believing in either.

The BNP are clearly Britain's foremost fascist party. He was making quite an uncontraversial claim.

Fascism does not refer to holding someone in contempt for their views. It is perfectly reasonable to be contemptous of fascism, and the suggestion that this anti-fascism is somehow fascism in its own way is absurd.
 
 
As the BNP have no real power in terms of in Parlianment and on Councils, why worry about them. They want people to know them and talk about them to get their message across, so if you just ignore it, they'll get bored of it.
 
 
Does not the National Front Count as a facist party?
 
 
Yes, they would. But are they still around? I know they used to be the big player in british fascism, but I was under the impression that it had collapsed into several splinter groups in the 80's, the largest and most succesful being the BNP...I might be wrong though.

Regardless, even if they are still around, the BNP are Britain's foremost fascist party at present. By a long shot.

I know, they are pretty much a group of thugs with no powers in comparison with the other far-right groups in Europe. I don't know why people bother creating topics about them.

not taking anyones side, but groups like the bnp thrive on events like the london bombings. the news will probably be full of we told you so! not all members are thugs- just like not all labour supporters are from the working class. you can't just say that about thousands of people

Mussolini said, "Facism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power."

If we take Nationalism out of your definition, Iago, many parties who never get tagged fascists would qualify, whereas nationalists without any of the other leanings are frequently tagged as fascists (me--on this forum, for example   ). The other way the word is commonly used is to denote totalitarianism, overruled children often call their parents 'fash'.

As Evil-Tuna points out the word has no meaning anymore because 99% of the time people misuse the word in these ways to close discussion by smearing an opponent (suggesting racism or excessive authoritarianism). The BNP are worth debating (800,000 voters), the fascist tag gets in the way.

The word is best avoided then, except to refer to self identifying fascists such as Mussolini or Mosley.
 
 
actually fascism is not only that of a political natire of the absence of political party parliamentary democracy but also on the corporate state in economic terms. this is the funny thing the bnp described as fafcists and nazis- could someone please telll me where it says the bnp in their manifesto want to get rid of democracy-and even more hilarious is the fact that in a recent speech nick griffin says a national referendum system similiar to that of switzerland would take place. basically for example if switzerland (which uses this referendum system ) was in the iraq war but enough people signed a petition(believe it to be 100,000 people) wanting the withdrawal of swiss troops in iraq if the sucessful 100,000 signatures are recieved it goes down to a national referendum. the bnp is more democratic then the labour party because if the referendum via petition system was bought into british democracy perhaps the 100,000's of people who marched on london in an anti war march plus about 70% of people who disagreed with the war could have stoppped it. please someone tell me how if 70% of people disagree with the war-which is more democratic-the 'labour' government in line with the toires(useless opposition party) telling the british people we are be involved in a war which is unpopular or a refferendum that says what the people who vote think. i think a referendum system is more popular and therefore the bnp are more democratic labour party.

IF the BNP is LESS DMOCRATIC then the LABOUR PARTY show me how this is so-i know a lot of labour supporters let down by tony blair and the labour party especially on the war on iraq and i havent heard that the bnp wants to do away with parliamentary democracy and therefore i dont consider them fascists-that is a term grossly misused by the ignorant and misinformed

perhaps you fail to realise that white european people havem ore right to this land than others. is it just me or did they NOT have a referendum on this mess thats being created from mass immigration. if they have the same right to this land how come they are more bothered about alien wars between india and pakistan then british issues like whether we want to give our sovereignty to a frankenstein monster more commonly known as the EU

We have a referendum on every issue every four years, if people don't like multiculturalism they could vote BNP/NF/N9S etc., instead they have voted in a pro-multiculturalism party every single time.

Why should a minority of xenophobes be able to overrule the pro-multicultural majority?
 
 
No... I don't agree with those kind of principles...

As said, we have a referendum atleast every 5 years. Obviously, not very many people agree with you. If you agree with these kind of principles, shouldn't we send all US citizens back to their countries of origin and leave the Native Americans as they have "more right to this land than others" ???

People vote for every issue in a G.E., not just immigration. I see that you have a good point, but think twokeyalexe has a good point too.

Enoch Powell was voted the most popular politician in Britain four years after the 'Rivers of Blood' speech. Opposition to immigration has always been very high, often a majority. The machine which overrides and vilifies a substantial section of the population (usually poorer working class people) is hardly democratic.

If you feel that the British shouldn't have the right to say no to more immigration - in a referendum you realise there's a good chance that people would say Enough! - and a referendum 50 years ago would probably have said No! - do you also think that the 'Native' Americans have nothing to gripe about? Should all the rights and powers be held by the immigrants, native interests and opinion ignored? Imperialism?
 
 
Nope, I think the BNP is a lot of (usually fairly stupid) people expounding an overly simplistic solution to a very difficult problem.

If the problem is how diverse peoples can live together and create a common nationality without their differences of race, behaviour, religion, traditions and cultures creating division and confict, then I think the simplistic answers come from everybody else but the BNP.

What's your answer? Where's it ever been done before?
 
 
BNP members = chavs/football hooligans.
Chavs/football hooligans = fools who deserve to be got by Mr.T.
Therefore, using logic and reasoning, we need to recruit Mr.T in order to solve the BNP problem.

The only "alien" here is you. You don't deserve to live in this country  .
 
 
Mr. T wears lots of gold, is unemployable, is hated by the law, gets into fights and talks "black". Mr. T is a chav. Or at least, the the missing-link between man and chav.

  That's not what a chav is. A chav is totally different, arguably mr.t maybe a rudeboy, definatly not a chav.

Yes, an overwhelming show of support for everyone's favourite mob.
 
 
the BNP would not benefit the country in the long run if they were elected, but in the current situation of islamic fundamentalism in the UK, and Muslim militancy in general I think that they would certainly be 100% more effective than any other party. Solution: Kick 'em all out.

the 'baddies,' and after that, basically any muslim who steps out of line. A 'one-strike-and-you're-out' type approach to Muslims would seem to be the most viable option. We don't need multiculturalism, never have done and never will do.
 
 
If you believe multiculturalism has had no advantages, you have lived a very sheltered life.
Although I like your idea if its extended to all the white football hooligans, chavs and extreme white nationalists.

But there doing nothing wrong with what they do because there white, right?

no, theres far, FAR more white scum than the ethnic minority equivalent. Id probably just make all anti-social elements do hard labout or forced military service.
 
 
If you're feeling more favourable to the BNP, you're as bad as the terrorists. Anyone who now says they "want to cleanse the nation" or something are just inciting the wrath of the fundamentalists.
 
 
arranque, you speaking like a neo-Hitler. Thats how they started.
 
 
i feel even more favourable to the bnp cus the bnp said what would happened and the government tried to lock them up for it

I know, lets all just lie down and take it up the arse in our own country, can't inflame the muslim terrorists now, god forbid, who SHOULDNT EVEN BE HERE. All muslims should be sent back to the land of their forebears.

No, my attitude towards the BNP is still unfavourable...because my fella is black... his dad was from barbados and he came over in the 50,s when he was 18 and died here (UK) in his 60,s he worked all his life....now if the BNP came to power what would happen to my fella and my 2 mixed race kiddies? its a simple question so i would like a simple answer.

You, him and your children would get the option* to go back to where he originally immigrated from.

Andrew

*that's what it says, whether anyone believes it is a different mattter, you have to assume if the BNP did ever get into power it'd be because the UK public was really really pissed off with immigrants for some reason or another. People might not want it to be an optional thing anymore therefore.

Ha! The option? It's like when you hear tales of someone getting expelled, its not "expelled", it's "asked to leave".

What if she declined that "option"?

How do I know? I don't write BNP policies. All I can do is quote the Manifesto and use my intelligence as I've said before, if the UK people have felt the need to vote in the BNP then something must have happened to really piss the majority off with regards to immigrants. Therefore I guess people wouldn't care whether immigrants were given the option or not to return these same people have after all voted in the BNP.

Maybe not the BNP, but no one can tell what the future holds. An economic crisis here, a few more terrorist attacks there. Read my linked post above.

If Blacks or Pakistanis behaved like Indians or Chinese the BNP would have far less support, and the crisis that's coming might never arrive.

You'll know when it's wisest to quit anyway and presumably you'll be welcome in Africa or Kingstontown.

I think you should look through the History books before making such statements. Public opinion is very open to suggestion, current events and perceivable living standards. All that is needed is more Muslims blowing themselves up perhaps combined with an economic disaster and Britain could quite easily vote in a far right party whether it be the BNP or whoever else comes along to fill their rather unpopular shoes.

Politics is all about timing and fears. If you have the former, and the masses have the latter you will succeed.

Andrew

 

You think it's a coincidence that the rise and fall of fascism in Europe happened at almost exactly the same time? Look at this:

 
Austria (1933-1938) - Austro-fascism: Dollfuß dissolved parliament and established a clerical-fascist dictatorship which lasted until Austria was incorporated into Germany through the Anschluss. Dollfuß's idea of a "Ständestaat" was borrowed from Mussolini.

Italy (1922-1943) - The first fascist country, it was ruled by Benito Mussolini (Il Duce) until he was dismissed and arrested on the 25 July 1943. Mussolini was then rescued from prison by German troops, and set up a short lived puppet state named "Repubblica di Salò" in northern Italy under the protection of the German army.

Germany (1933-1945) - Ruled by the Nazi movement of Adolf Hitler (der Führer). In the terminology of the Allies, Nazi Germany was as their chief enemy the mightiest and best-known fascist state. See above for a discussion on the differences and similarities between Nazism and fascism.

Spain (1936-1975) - After the 1936 arrest and execution of its founder José Antonio Primo de Rivera during the Spanish Civil War, the fascist Falange Española Party was allied to and ultimately came to be dominated by Generalissimo Francisco Franco, who became known as El Caudillo, the undisputed leader of the Nationalist side in the war, and, after victory, head of state until his death over 35 years later. However, it was best described as an autocracy based on the Falangist fascist principles in its early years. By the mid-50s, the Spanish Miracle and the rise of the Opus Dei in the Franco regime led to Falangist fascism being discarded and fascists minimized in importance.

Portugal (1932-1974) - Although less restrictive than the Italian, German and Spanish regimes, the Estado Novo regime of António de Oliveira Salazar was quasi-fascist. However, it was closer to the Spanish example of paternal authoritarianism than the Italian fascist or German Nazi model.

Greece - Joannis Metaxas' 1936 to 1941 dictatorship was not particularly ideological in nature, and might hence be characterized as authoritarian rather than fascist. The same can be argued regarding Colonel George Papadopoulos' 1967 to 1974 military dictatorship, which was supported by the United States.

Belgium (1940-1945) - The violent Rexist movement and the Vlaamsch-Nationaal Verbond party achieved some electoral success in the 1930s. Many of its members assisted the Nazi occupation during World War II. The Verdinaso movement, too, can be considered fascist. Its leader, Joris Van Severen, was killed before the Nazi occupation. Some of its adepts collaborated, but others joined the resistance. These collaborationist movements are generally classified as belonging to the National Socialist model or the German fascist model because of its brand of racial nationalism and the close relation with the occupational authorities.

Slovakia (1939-1944) - The Slovak People's Party was a quasi-fascist nationalist movement associated with the Catholic Church. Founded by Father Andrej Hlinka, his successor Monsignor Jozef Tiso became the Nazis' quisling in a nominally independent Slovakia. The clerical element lends comparison with Austrofascism or the clerical fascism of Croatia, though not to the excesses of either model. The market system was run on principles agreeing with the standard Italian fascist model of industrial regulation.

France (1940-1944) - The Vichy regime of Philippe Pétain, established following France's defeat by Germany, collaborated with the Nazis, including in the death of 65,000 French Jews. However, the minimal importance of fascists in the government until its direct occupation by Germany makes it appear to seem more similar to the regime of Franco or Salazar than the model fascist powers. While it has been argued that anti-Semitic massacres performed by the Vichy regime were more in the interests of pleasing Germany than in service of ideology, anti-semitism was strong in France before World War II.

Romania (1940-1944) - The violent Iron Guard took power when Ion Antonescu forced King Carol II to abdicate. The Antonescu regime began as a system similar to the Italian fascist model, but would become more and more focused on goals of racial cleansing as the war with the Soviets continued, eventually adopting the Nazist example. The regime ended after Soviet troops entered the country.

Independent State of Croatia (1941-1945) - Poglavnik Ante Pavelić, leader of the infamous Ustaše movement, came to power in 1941 as the Croatian puppet leader under the control of Nazi Germany. Under the indirect control of Germany, the Ustaše regime was based heavily upon both upon clerical fascism and the Italian model of fascism, with elements of racial integrity and organic nationalism drawn from Nazism.

Norway (1943-1945) - Vidkun Quisling had staged a coup d'état during the German invasion on April 9th, 1940. This first government was replaced by a Nazi puppet government under his leadership from February 1st, 1943. His party had never had any substantial support in Norway, undermining his attempts to emulate the Italian fascist state.
 

The conditions after WWI were such that extreme nationalism, coupled with a fear of outsiders was able to grow and be exploited by leaders. This is simply not the case today and it never will be. I think the conditions for fascism to thrive are very limited. For example the fact that we don't have proportional representation doesn't help your feeble cause.

However, the main reason a party such as the BNP will never come to power is that the vast majority of voters are intelligent enough to see the massive damage such a political group would do. Most of our generation have been at school with kids of non-white ethnicity. The vast majority of sensible people can see that a handful of fanatics are not a reason to enforce a massive program of chucking out non-white people. The BNP et al can use scare tactics all they like but it simply won't work. Ever.

I don't think it's a suprise, and I know a lot about how/why/what caused fascism. I also believe those conditions could arise again, maybe not to create a fascist Government but perhaps a new form of right wing leadership. Fascism managed to get significant support in all the countries you listed in a matter of years of it's very conception. For everyone here to look 100's of years into the future and suggest nothing like that could happen again is foolish. I doubt many people after the Great War thought anything like that would/could possibly happen again. The exact same feeling we have now.

Was the extreme nationalism a response to the extreme internationalism of Communism?
Cultural Marxism has undoubtedly proved more effective at wiping out national identities in easy times, but economic crisis, threat of minority status, or the challenge of Islam will wake up the aracial White dopes. It's much more likely that things will kick off on the continent first--demographics and temperament make it likely to inevitable that the Italians or French will lead the way.

Naive. Rwanda, Yugoslavia and Hitler's Germany found people spouting the same platitudes.

Why so sure it couldn't happen here? You're claiming that we won't be like everybody else everywhere throughout history and you're not explaining why...
 
 
What about the anti-rationalist elements of the far right? What role do those play in this time of science and scepticism?
