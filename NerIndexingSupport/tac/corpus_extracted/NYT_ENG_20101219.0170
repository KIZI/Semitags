TAMPA  The Kid With the Magic Hair showed up just before 9
wearing a hat! Would his cotton-candy-jacked loyalists even
recognize him? Of course they would, and just as expected, the
tectonic plates beneath Tampa Bay shifted and shook from the
welcoming screams, a decibel level on par with a swarm of lorikeets
nibbling on your cerebellum.

There's loud, and then there's the awesomely awesome noise made
inside a sold-out St. Pete Times Forum on Sunday, when Justin
Bieber, the hottest, cutest, scrawniest pop star on the planet,
hosted a 95-minute eeeeek!-a-thon for 15,818 tweens, teens and,
last but not shyest, grownup gals who'd love to pinch his cheeks
and make him eat his Wheaties.

The 16-year-old Canadian is very much a 21st-century phenom. He
has lived his entire stretch of celebrity on YouTube, the online
video warehouse where his amateur performances were discovered by
music-biz mucketies (including R&B crooner Usher) a couple of
years back. The kid's fame was instant; in 2010, he was the
most-watched artist on YouTube, a social-media seducer that allows
fans to feel as if they can lurk and love on JB any time, any hour.

The truth is that we know very little about the Biebz, but
therein lies the hook  and they are hooked. With all due respect to
the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus, fellow teen-pop comets who once
burned bright, the hosannas hurled at Bieber were the loudest I've
ever heard at the Times Forum.

Seriously, there were poodles in Miami who were hiding under the
couch from this particular shrieking session.

There are great cultural forces at hand in the molding of
Bieber, but let's be honest: It doesn't hurt that the lil' squirt
is put-him-in-your-pocket adorable, a baby-baby-baby-faced kid with
a vaguely '70s pixie hairdo and a platinum album (My World 2.0)
full of safe, flirtatious, teen-pop hits.

Bieber can sing a bit, too, a Tiger Beat coo that flutters and
sighs and breaks seventh-grade hearts in all the right places. It
should be noted, however, that he wasn't doing a whole lot of that
during the show's first two songs, Love Me and Bigger, which
featured slick, gliding dance moves that were borrowed directly
from the House of MJ, which would be dutifully repaid later with a
weak but loving cover of Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.

If the Biebz was dancing, that probably meant he wasn't
"singing," if you catch my drift. And let's say there was a lot
of dancing onstage. In fact, everyone in his 10-piece band was
busting a move! At one point, I think I saw his personal chef doing
the Electric Slide.

But lest I anger his fans  who showed up in homemade "I Heart
JB" shirts and waving glittery posters, a sea of young women who
couldn't believe their luck at being in the same room as their
beloved  I'll allow that Bieber has skills. He pounded the drums
for local fans, then took to a white baby grand, too. And he
eventually got around to singing for real.

As the show's highlight, he was strapped into a giant metallic
heart and lifted high above the crowd, all the while strumming an
acoustic guitar and belting out Never Let You Go and Favorite Girl.
The place went bonkers, and in a classic moment, Bieber paused,
taking it all in like it was NBD (no big deal, yo).

In building the perfect pop star (at least one who can make a
planet full of young and old lose their lungs in salute), it's a
bonus that said celeb has ice water in his veins. And give Bieber
credit: He loves the stage, loves showing off, a schoolyard hunk
ruling the jungle gym for the sake of the ladies.

The show closed with Bieber's biggest hit, Baby, which is a
fiendishly catchy pop song for sure. Was he actually singing it?
Well, in the end, that wasn't the point now, was it? He was here,
like all the pop phenoms before him, to be screamed at. And bless
those little lorikeets, they gave him an earful.
