 
 
Schwarzenegger vs Stallone
 
 
Two of the biggest action stars ever, which one do you prefer?

I think they are both as equally awesome.
 
 
I think they're both equal in that neither of their faces seem to move too much. And when Arnie 'cries', he scrunches up his forehead as though determination and/or constipation are setting in.

They're all muscle and not much subtlety.

Needless to say, they're not 'my thing'.  
 
 
Old post but Schwarzenegger!
 
 
Blatantly Schwarzenegger. I can have entire conversations with my friends made up of Arnie quotes.
 
 
100% Schwartzenegger. Stallones made some excellent films such as the Rocky's but Arnie's Terminator franchise is just absolutely phenominal.
 
 
Arnold by far, hes much more of an accomplished man. 7 time Mr Olympia winner!!!! world famous film star and now the mayor of California. the guys a pure legend.
 
 
Pure legend indeed. He's so buff!

What are your favourite arnie films? Terminator has to be high up in my fav list.
 
 
The answer has to be Arnie. He's been in stuff like Terminator and Total Recall, which are well-made films with at least some credibility. He has a warm kind of feeling to him as well, which I think comes from me seeing his films often as a child. He has that Bruce Willis kind of 80s/90s bizarre charm.

I always remind myself that Stallone is probably the more talented, though. He writes and I think even directs a lot of his films, but then again they're mostly terrible so that could be discounted.
 
 
Arnie.
