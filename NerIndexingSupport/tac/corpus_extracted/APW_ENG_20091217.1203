Jermain Taylor's boxing future remains uncertain after his promoter dropped him, citing concerns about the former middleweight champion's health.

Norman Horton, Taylor's publicist, said on Thursday he didn't have any comment on the boxer's plans. Taylor has lost four of his last five fights, three by knockout. He was hospitalized after his last defeat, a 12th-round knockout in October by Arthur Abraham as part of the Showtime-backed Super Six super middleweight tournament.

If Taylor continues in that tournament, it will be without promoter Lou DiBella, who said last week he was recusing himself. DiBella said if Taylor continues his career, it would put the fighter "at unnecessary risk."

Taylor beat Bernard Hopkins in 2005 to win the WBC and WBO middleweight titles, which he held for two years.
