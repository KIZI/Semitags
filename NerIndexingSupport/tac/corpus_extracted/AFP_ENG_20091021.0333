Romania's opposition called on President Traian Basescu Wednesday to drop the
nomination of the economist Lucian Croitoru as prime minister and to appoint
instead Klaus Iohannis, mayor of the city of Sibiu.

In a statement, 252 opposition lawmakers demanded that "Romania's president
designate Klaus Iohannis as candidate for the prime minister position as he is
supported by an absolute and transparent majority in parliament".

This official declaration was made a few days before Croitoru's deadline to
present his government team before the parliament and ask for a vote of
confidence.

The centre-right government of Prime Minister Emil Boc, head of the Democratic
Liberal Party (PDL), collapsed last week following a no-confidence vote by the
three main opposition parties, the Social democrats (PSD), the Liberals (PNL)
and the ethnic Hungarian UMDR party.

If Croitoru fails to get parliament's vote of confidence, President Basescu said
he would either designate a PDL member to set up the new government or maintain
the toppled government in place until after the presidential election, which is
to take place in two rounds on November 22 and December 6.
