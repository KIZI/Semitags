Pakistan's cricket authorities on Tuesday appointed former opener Mohsin Hasan
Khan as the national team's chief selector following the humiliating defeats on
their recent tour of Australia.

The post became vacant with the resignation of Iqbal Qasim, who resigned on
January 31 shortly after Pakistan lost the tour's one-day series 5-0 and the
Test series 3-0.

"Mohsin Hasan Khan has been appointed as chairman of the selection committee
with immediate effect," Wasim Bari, the Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) chief
operating officer, told AFP.

Khan, 54, who has played 48 Tests and 75 limited-overs matches for Pakistan,
said he had been approached by the PCB to take over the post.

"I will finalise my strategy once I meet the chairman of the board," he told AFP
after his appointment.

"I have a passion to serve Pakistan cricket and will do my best to select
players on merit," he added.

Khan's first task will be to select Pakistan's squad for the World Twenty20
championship, to be held in the West Indies in April-May, when Pakistan will
defend the title they won in England last year.

The PCB has also formed a committee to investigate the defeats in Australia.
