Twenty-three police officers are being investigated by Guatemalan authorities
for cocaine theft, said local press on Monday.

About 1.04 tons of drugs were seized in two operations by the National Civilian
Police (PNC) last Thursday, while only 883 kilograms reached PNC warehouses,
Guatemala's Interior Minister Raul Velasquez told a Guatemala City radio
station.

The suspended PNC officers would be kept under guard until the investigation
closed, Velasquez said.

Based on data from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, cocaine in Guatemala costs
up to 10,400 U.S. dollars per kilo. These stolen drugs could thus be worth more
than 1.2 million U.S. dollars.

Around 200 tons of cocaine pass through Guatemala each year. Most of the cocaine
enters Mexico and then reaches the United States, according to Guatemalan media.
