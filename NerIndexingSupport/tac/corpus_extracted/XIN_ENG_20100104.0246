El Salvador's murder rate has risen to 71 per 100, 000 citizens in 2009, the
highest in Latin America, according to news reaching here Monday.

This represented an increase of 37 percent over the previous year, said the
National Civilian Police (PNC) on Monday.

In 2009, a total of 4,365 people met violent deaths, or a daily average of 12
murders, the PNC said in a statement.

The World Health Organization put the average murder rate in Latin America at 18
per 100,000 people. In Mexico, the number was 11 per 100, 000, far less than in
El Salvador.

In addition to foreign drug trafficking groups, two main criminal gangs, Mara
Salvatrucha and Mara 18, were responsible for most murders in the country, the
PNC said.

The Mara gangs, set up by Salvadoreans in Los Angeles, the United States in the
1980s, have spread to Central America and other parts of the United States and
Canada.
