Big XII bowel predictions, take deux

Assuming Missouri gets its revenge next week:

BCS MNC      Missouri
Fiesta       Kansas
Cotton       Texas
Holiday      Oklahoma
Alamo        Texas Tech
Sun          Oklahoma State
Insight      Colorado
Independence Texas A&M

The Gator has the fourth pick, but I'm guessing they'll forego taking
Texas Tech for Connecticut or South Florida. That means they're locked
into taking two Big XII teams the next two years.

If OU does win:

Fiesta       Oklahoma
Cotton       Missouri
Gator        Kansas
Holiday      Texas
Alamo        Texas Tech
Insight      Oklahoma State
Independence Colorado
Texas        Texas A&M

Obviously, Missouri/Kansas and the surge of fans they'd bring would be
more palatable to the Gator Bowl than T. Tech.

I think the possibility of an OU-KU Fiesta Bowl is out there, though
somewhat unlikely.

I think Gator Bowl has to pick a Big 12 team since last year they has
already chosen a Big East team. It is a two year cycle.

It's a "2 in 4" deal. They have to take a Big 12 team two years out of
the four year contract. They can take a Big East team this year, but it
just means they can't take a Big East team or Notre Dame in '08 or '09.

If South Florida is available to them, I think they'll take them, even
if it means they'll miss the ND Comeback Tour next year.

Unless there's some sort of tiebreaker lock-in I'm not aware
of, I kinda doubt that the Alamo takes Zorro over A&M. A&M
sells tickets. Zorro doesn't.

Didn't Tech sell out their allotment last time they went to SA?

There's no tiebreaker -- the Alamo either picks fourth (if the Gator
passes) or fifth (if the Gator uses their fourth pick). They can choose
from whatever bowl-eligible team is left. Bowls usually try to not reach
too much, though, because that pisses off the Big XII office (e.g., if
Nebraska had won and were eighth, the Cotton wouldn't take them just
because they're Nebraska lest they get angry phone calls and find
themselves without a contract come renewal time).

Don't you talk ugly to me, Bernard M. Wrangle. I'll send you to the moon with
my magic shirt!

 

The Alamo was pretty full the last time they picked Zorro (2001). I wuz ther.

I suppose so, but their record of doing so isn't all that long.
I guess we'll see.

They can't get the jump and select ND this year?

What are you talking about? ND is already in the Sugar Bowl thanks to
winning consecutive games to end the season.
