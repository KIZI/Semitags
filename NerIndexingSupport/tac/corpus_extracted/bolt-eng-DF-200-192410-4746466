 
 
Captain Jack Harkness' Hair
 
 
What styling product do you think he uses?

 
 

Not that I want to look like him, particularly, of course.  
 
 
Essence of gay.
 
 
I guess it's hairspray.
 
 
He spoke about it once in an interview but all I can remember is that it was very cheap and he used alot of it.

I think I spontaneously orgasm everytime i see him.
=D

Looks like I'll have to watch hours of John Barrowman videos until I find it then! Searching together would make time go a lot quicker though   hehe
 
 
Ah, John Barrowman.  

Sorry though, I don't know the answer.

Hahaha this isn't a comparison of size though; but of his perfection!    
I still can't think of a double meaning for my poem; perhaps I should make out I'm in love with IMechE to make it easier!
