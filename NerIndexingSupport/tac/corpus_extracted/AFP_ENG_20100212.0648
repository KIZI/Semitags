Mexican multi-billionaire Carlos Slim has received authorization to merge his
telecom companies, America Movil, Telemex and Telemex International, the Federal
Competition Commission (CFC) said Thursday.

In the merger, America Movil will buy up 71.5 percent of Mexican Telephone
(Telmex) shares and up to 100 percent of Telmex International, the CFC said.

The consolidation, it added, "does not alter the market structure they
participate in... (nor) competition conditions " in Mexico, since the companies
belonged to the same economic group before the restructure.

America Movil last month announced the merger plan it said was intended to make
the company more competitive in Latin America by offering bundled service for
telephone, mobile telephone, internet and cable television.
