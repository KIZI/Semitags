An appeal court on Tuesday ordered SAS Norway, a unit of Scandinavian Airlines
System (SAS), to pay its low-cost rival Norwegian 20 million euros in damages
for illegally accessing its data.

The ruling followed a court order in October 2007 in which SAS Norway was
ordered to pay a fine of four million kroner (685,000 dollars, 498,000 euros)
for illegally using the Amadeus booking system to get information about
Norwegian's pricing schedule some three years after the end of an accord linking
Norwegian and SAS subsidiary Braathens.

In a subsequent ruling in May 2008, SAS Norway was ordered to pay 26.3 million
dollars.

Following a lengthy price war, Norwegian threw in the towel on its routes to
Aalesund and Molde, two towns now served only by SAS Norway.

SAS Norway said it was reviewing the Oslo Appeal Court's decision.

"We are disappointed by the ruling of the Court of Appeal. We had hoped that
this matter had been resolved by this ruling," said managing director Mats
Jansson.

"However, we note that it was not unanimous and we will now examine the ruling
further to evaluate whether it should be appealed," he added.
