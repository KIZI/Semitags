 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/n...Hong-Kong.html 

This has been on the cards for a few months now.

Looks like now the City-supporting governments of Blair and Brown have been replaced by a populist anti-profit making Coalition, the relocation will happen.

Wonder how Osborne will replace the lost tax revenues? Maybe some more taxes on Middle England or possibly more cuts to the armed forces to balance the books.
 
 
Good Riddance.
 
 
HSBC was orginally established in Hong Kong and Shanghi anyway so its hardly surprising they want to go back there. I expect a Communism government would be better for a bank than a capitalist one.

I'm sure we would not miss the taxes they did not pay or have to bail them out when they screw up.

Thats because Communism works.

From each according to his investment, to each according to his shares.
 
 
 
Good Riddance.

 

Well, we're losing out on money  
I'm not surprised either, over a billion in tax.

I don't know what China is but I don't think it's Communist.

More of a Pseudo-Communist-Quasi-Capitalist-Technocracy type thing.

They must have very incompetent tax lawyers and accountants if they are pay anywhere that much in corporation tax.
 
 
I blame the public. Full of idiots who don't understand anything about the economy demanding the government does idiotic stuff. Oh and the Lib Dems, always blame the Lib Dems.

Its a state controlled form of capitalism and it works.

But let the US keep telling everybody that "freedom" is what brings prosperity.

How are the fiscal deficits going in the US guys? Need to borrow a bit more from China eh?

They were doing pretty good compared to the other banks  
 
 
HSBC stands for H ong Kong & S hanghai B anking C orporation so it should be based at least in a Chinese city.

Nothing to do with China's massive workforce willing to work for tiny amounts of money compared to the US eh?

And of course at some point I would think China's horrific human rights record, which normally seem to go hand in hand with 'communism', would have to be regarded.

Intresting. I wonder if they will make a last minute change. Surely moving your business is going to cost a lot and is very difficult.
 
 
Its not going to signal an exodus. There are many advantages of living in London.
 
 
Not decided on according to the bbc. Wuld be a massive loss to britain if it were to happen though. Even Alistair Darling said these banks generate a lot of wealth for the UK economy. HSBC didn't get bailed out and just made 12 billion in profits.

The cost is minimal compared to savings in even the short-term. This doesn't just apply for corporation tax, they've (alongside many other banks) have moved their derivative offices from London to Paris - the latter b/c its part of the Eurozone and thus has less tightly enforced derivative transaction costs. When you're talking about upward of 100's of millions and even billions of individual derivative transactions OTC, it amounts to a heavy saving rate.

For Barclays for example, it'll take less than a decade for the cost of moving the office - and that's using conservative estimates. Argubaly moving an entire company is a lot more costly, but Hong Kong, aside from New York, will be the largest financial center in the world.
 
 
Quick piece of information for the ill-informed users on here who only know to vilify any and all banks/bankers regardless of the facts.

HSBC did not take any money from the government, they completely refused the bail-out funds.

So this is in fact bad news (although there's been talks of HSBC wanting to move for a while, today the CEO denied that news report). If they leave, that means less tax from them (which is in the order of billions), people will be made redundant and it'll weaken our financial centre. For one of the city's prominent banks to leave isn't good signs at all and may even prompt other banks to do the same (although unlikely)

It's easy to call for extreme measures and regulations on banks but this can only work if it's done throughout the world. London can't afford to do it alone because it just won't be as profitable as other major financial capitals which would allow for more profits to be made.
Already these extra bonus tax and limitations have started to force the top talent to move overseas, it would be a huge setback if banks start to move too.
 
 
 
Nothing to do with China's massive workforce willing to work for tiny amounts of money compared to the US eh?

 

Well the US is supposed to be the capitalist country isn't it? They could just let wages adjust downwards to become more competitive than China.
 
 
 
How are the fiscal deficits going in the US guys? Need to borrow a bit more from China eh?

 

Indeed, its the US which is in the weaker position here.

After all, its not like the Chinese have more than half their net wealth tied in the performance of US treasures, its not as if the US has the reserve currency of the world (one which the Chinese are pegged to incidentally) and nor do the US have an absolutely solid (i.e. world buyer of last resort) central bank which can buy and hold onto the debt in the short to medium term.

Learn basic economics first mate - if you had just even looked at the TED/Dollar LIBOR spread and Chinese real-rates at their net present and terminal value, you'd save yourself from making such a basic/substantial/simplistic/populist error in thinking

Terrible news, and the British public are to blame by compelling the government to be "tough on the banks". The political parties couldn't not be seen to be giving the Banking system some punishment for what happened; even though it was totally counter-intuitive.

So you can't say "oh it's all the coalition's fault". Not at all - if anything, the Tories would have wanted to do nothing about them and let them generate wealth. Labour allowed the banking system to run out of control. The armchair economists that read the tabloids are the people we should be blaming as they've been shouting loudest to influence government policy on this matter.

It's a real shame that HSBC feel that they have to leave the UK and return to the Far East, but the numbers just don't stack up for them to remain in the UK. I can't blame them.

Whilst I agree with the sentiment, you'd be better off taking your own advice and researching what on earth your talking about.

HSBC may not have taken bail-out funds, but it did take advantage of liquidity measures imposed at the Bank of England - meaning that the real-rate they received was substantially less than the overnight swap rates which they would have otherwise gotten, had they not tapped into the BoE facility. The same case can be made with hybrid security deposits on non-financed and mezzanine level debt, OTC swap transactions on real-return interest rates and so on and so on.

To say HSBC took no government support is a fallacious statement at best - just b/c they were not directly bailed out, did not mean they didn't take any government support at all - support they didn't need to take and if they hadn't, I would agree with your initial statement.

Well absolutely the worlds largest economies are always interconnected.
You could have also mentioned that China also relies on the US and other Western markets for buying their exports.
If its a case of winners and losers then the winners are going to be less well off due to the impact on the losers.

Although it wouldn't fill me with confidence that the US central bank can monetise the debt. In practice I doubt they will default.
 
 
 
Well the US is supposed to be the capitalist country isn't it? They could just let wages adjust downwards to become more competitive than China.

 

And with that they would go socially backwards. China's wages and living standards will and are rising.

Give it a few more years and the people will be demanding better rights as well.

In 50 years China may well be a lot like America
 
 
 
......

 

The US would never default on its debt - it would quite LITERALLY bring the world to its knees; everything (i.e. not just the imports the US takes in and exports it sends out etc etc), is based upon the US. LIBOR/Euro-LIBOR etc (i.e. the rates at which everything from interest rates to swap debt is set at), is based upon the US treasury rates etc.

If the US did come close to default - such is the perverse situation - it'll be everyone but the US that shall suffer the most. One only has to look at QE2 to see the marginal (if any) negative impact this has had on US rates, and the effect its had on emerging markets (particularly Latin America and Asia) and to a lesser extent, the EU.

Hedge fund exodus costs UK £500m

One in four hedge fund employees have left London to move to Switzerland, where the tax regime is considered more stable.

The departure of two industry leaders – Alan Howard, founder of Brevan Howard, Europe’s biggest hedge fund, and Mike Platt, founder of BlueCrest Capital, the third biggest – will cost the Revenue £200m, according to a Financial Times analysis of their funds’ accounts. Both men declined to comment.

Enough Said.
 
 
Well done Socialists.
 
 
Surely the biggest concern is the loss of jobs. Imagine how much income tax and NI is paid by HSBC employees.

The only reason why London is as rich and powerful as it is, is because of the financial services industry. If the trend for ofshoring this industry continues or even becomes a flood, London will become a Ghost Town.

This country in fact could not survive without our financial sector. I'm worried. The financial sector is one of the few industries we have that creates well paid jobs. Where are we all going to work if it moves abroad?

The Conservatives pushed for less regulation before the crisis so if they were in power the mess would have been worse.
 
 
 
Well done Socialists.

 

You mean the ones, effectively, out of power and just muttering angrily with no coherent strategy at the coalition?

Or the ones that don't even have an elected MP but a mere few scatterings of council holdings?

Or the ones lead by an ex-Miner Unionist?

Or the non-electoral Eurocommunists?
 
 
 
HSBC is a capitalist bank, it shouldn't have its head office in China which is a communist country. It could never move to the mainland for so many reasons.

For its head office to be a Chinese city it must be in one of the SAR's, and its future in one of them is dependant on what happens when the time runs out on the one country two city policy. This is one of the reasons why HSBC currently has its head offices in London. What the directors of HSBC expect to happen ito HK when the 50 years SAR period is up will obviously have an impact on the decision for them to move HQ back to queens street... Anyway, the directors decision to relocate will have to be ratified by shareholders via a  special resolution  if I am not mistaken (I could be wrong), which, given the above, may not happen.

 

Well, you have to consider that "Communist" China is crawling towards Liberalism. By the time the 50 year SAR period runs out it may make no real impact on HSBC's operations.

Or it [China] may be taken over by reactionaries and when the SAR period runs out the secret police will be sent in to take the head of capitalist swine pigdogs.
 
 
 
Its not going to signal an exodus. There are many advantages of living in London.

 

But there are also many advantages of living in HK too which may see many of the workforce move over as well. Although housing is quite expensive, food, clothing, technology, travel is very cheap.
 
 
 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12658880  Don't believe everything you read in the papers. Many contradictory reports.

Saw an article in the Economist that quite a few workers that move abroad end up coming back to London because of the culture shock they get when moving abroad

Very interesting.

Could it be that they let this little nugget slip from an "unnamed" investor to send a coded message to the government? Keep going on this path and we will consider moving?

You see some major companies moving out in the next few years?
Do you see them moving back?

I was talking about the HSBC workforce in my original post. But if Hong Kong continues to build its international image, then I don't see why major companies would not consider moving there: close to China for factories, but not under the pseudo-Communist government; technology and general amenities are cheap; English is like the second language, although Mandarin is making a comeback since the handover; much of the business is conducted in English. However, for now, I don't see it overtaking London and New York any time soon and as for your question about moving back, I think many would stay, make enough money for a comfortable retirement then return home.
 
 
This country is so ****ed.
I know many people complain about the banks, but at the end of the day the amount of money made from taxing them is so large and crucial, this country can not afford to lose them.

i wouldn't want to swap my (hypothetical) family home in the home counties for a high rise flat in polluted hong kong really.
 
 
It seems stupid that banks that didn't fail are being tarred with the same brush as though that did fail.

It just shows how easy it is for the media to brainwash the common masses. There is absolutely no justification for the limits on bonuses for execs of extremely successful banks. But oh no, Joe Public has decided the government needs to meddle more in business it has not right to.

Sometimes I despair for humanity.

It's actually very nice in the parts of Hong Kong that most ex-pats live in. The air is certainly cleaner in those areas than in London. And the social life for those who work in banks in exquisite.

Well the Asia Miles I've accumulated say otherwise. You've obviously never stepped foot out of Disneyland HK because if you hang around Central, everything I've said is true.
 
 
"You pay billions in tax every year! You pay back your loans with massive interest! Your industry is the best one we have! Get out!"

Some people, eh?
 
 
If they do move out, I'm officially closing my account with HSBC.
 
 
..and Go for Barclays who are, frankly, a lot better.
 
 
I had a lot of respect for HSBC I can't believe they're doing this!
 
 
 
All banks are greedy

 

Yes, but remember how heavily they get hit by tax, thus the government makes more money by them being greedy.
 
 
'telegraph' disgusting liars!

"HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, has denied reports it is planning to move its head office from London to Hong Kong."

HSBC to quit London for Hong Kong

 

Makes sense, lower taxes and the fact that HSBC is originally from Hong Kong doesn't make this surprising.
 
 
Who will wreck our economy now?
 
 
Punishing the banks is a superficial move. Better to let them get on with it and help the economy back on its feet in my opinion. Yeh, the guys at the top get lots of money. But that's what you do when you want the best personnel. YOU PAY THEM.
 
 
Well done Mervyn King, you blame shifting fool who couldn't regulate a sheep-farm, you and your "burn all bankers, bring back the motherland" populist politicians have managed to screw the UK over so bad the few banks who did not **** up(i.e. not RBS) are thinking of (and despite the officials denials, the rumour mill for an HSBC move has been strong for some time) moving. Thatcher destroys industry, Labour creates bloated middle management jobs and breaks the university system to push down unemployment numbers, now the Tories don't have the guts or the ability to stop listening to the BBC(who just want more hits on their blogs) and the Guardian(who want to sell papers) because apparently there's a "revolution"(that is of course if X-Factor and Eastenders isn't on) on the 26th and they're scared. Politicians, the bane of all common sense.
 
 
The good thing about banking regulation in Hong Kong is its done with bullets. Chairman Mao did say power comes from the barrel of a gun.

They didn't put enough in that we could bail them out without becoming in massive debt - therefore their contribution is a negative one.
 
 
HSBC have made it clear they DO NOT plan on moving. They review their location on a 3 year cycle as the norm.
 
 
 
Well done Socialists.

 

When you say 'socialists', you mean George Osborne, right...?

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_China 

Still reckon China is better than the U.S.? Sure, it has a considerably faster growing economy and a massive budget surplus, but it still exhibits a shocking poverty rate. Oh and by the way, China has stupidly high inflation. And that hits the 80% of its rural population even harder.

The U.S. aren't the only debt-stricken OECD, and they certainly aren't the worst. It's a long road to recovery, but the average American isn't as financially worse off as his Chinese counterpart.

It's a single party capitalist state that works for a minority of its population and investors. That is a far more accurate depiction.

There is virtually no regulation on banks in Hong Kong.. and what the hell has Chairman Mao got to do with it when it was under British rule
 
 
This is but the beginning of the great exodus. Pharma and banking are the first sectors to be deserting the UK, and the rest will quickly follow if things continue as they are.

It's painfully gut-wrenching to watch a government no one wanted dig a hole for this country that we may well never truly climb of.

I think the rumors were made for just trying to boost the share price on the opening Monday in HK but regret HSBC has cleared the rumor on Sunday night...
I think if they do switch to HK, they can surely save a lot of tax and the share price should have a positive impact..
HSBC's shares have not been performing good comparing to other stocks...

Ooops
yeah sorry about that. 1.3 billion. But its still 1 billion more than the population of the US.
When they calculate polls as I said, they use this fact and so of course China will look poor in comparison to lots of country because of it.
And how is it a point that doesnt make sense?..you were talking about the rate of poverty..a lot of poverty polls will take this into account! There are more poor people in China, but there are also more people in China..of course there are other aspects of it as well. But its an important point to mention.

Poverty rate. Percentage of poverty within a population. There are more people in China, but there is also a significantly greater percentage of poor people in China. It doesn't matter if there are more people in China. Zimbabwe only has a population of 13 million, does that make China a poorer nation because there are more poor people China?

It's not an important point at all, because it's just entirely wrong. The number of poor people is significant in its own right, but when comparing wealth disparity within nations, it's more reliable to compare the percentage in poverty.

This is cyclical sabre rattling. Here is an article from 2006 where they supposedly planned the same thing:

 http://business.scotsman.com/banking...ain.2816310.jp 

HSBC paid something like £400 million in UK corporation tax in 2009 which represents only a small percentage of global revenues. I think the banks are just as bothered about being used as a political football than they are about the money.

If youre talking about wealth distribution then of course China would be pretty bad in that. But when you look at the economical model that the Chinese economy runs on then of course it would produce disparities such as this. Its not a good thing of course, but then China would not be where it is if it hadnt used it. I guess its a question of whats more important and in the Chinese government's case, the people in the country do not matter as much as the "country" itself although maybe im wrong there..
But I accept your argument anyways.
 
 
I don't know why people are rejoicing. If the relocation goes ahead, we'll be faced with tens of billions of pounds in lost tax revenues which will likely be made up for by the British middle class.

I was genuinely surprised when I found out that the Hong Kong and Shangai Banking Corporation was headquartered in London
 
 
 
It's a point that doesn't make any sense. Besides how is a population of 1.3 billion even remotely close to 2 billion?

 

why on earth it is not making any sense???? Just compare a family with 50 children plus annual earnings $ 10 million with another family with only one child plus annual earning $1 million, appearently the $1 million family is poorer but certainly has a better quality of life as a whole.

1.3 billion is the figure over 15 years ago, mate
 
 
 
Poverty rate. Percentage of poverty within a population. There are more people in China, but there is also a significantly greater percentage of poor people in China. It doesn't matter if there are more people in China. Zimbabwe only has a population of 13 million, does that make China a poorer nation because there are more poor people China?

It's not an important point at all, because it's just entirely wrong. The number of poor people is significant in its own right, but when comparing wealth disparity within nations, it's more reliable to compare the percentage in poverty.

 

It is VERY important, the number of population is very important when it comes to a hugely massive number. If the US's population become 10 times more, the country would be in an entirely different state, which means internal competiveness for jobs would become more intense, more people tend to lose jobs or more people would potentially earn less and therefore the percentage rate of poor people tend to rally. So as the number of population goes mental, the greater the number is, the greater the percentage of poorer is, it's just as simple as that. It's like if the U.S. economy is saturated for its job opportunities, say 300 million is the limit, then the more extra population they have got, the bigger percentage of poor people they will have. Do you understand now????

You can't compare Zimbabwe and China in terms of the number of population since there is a sharp difference between the size of the two country.
 
 
There was a hilarious article in the Economist the other week. They interviewed a few bankers who moved to Zurich. Apparently they're spending more money there than they would have otherwise paid in Britain for the same benefits. They can't get their kids into good international schools, can't find properties in ideal locations and are getting bored so spending a lot of money on flights back to London.

They'll go. But they'll come back, along with their tax receipts. Quality.
