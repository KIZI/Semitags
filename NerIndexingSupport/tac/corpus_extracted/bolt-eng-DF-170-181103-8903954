 
 
Declare victory in Afghanistan,And pull troops out
 
 
To hell with Nation building.Al qaeda is in Packistan.Osama Bin Laden is dead.
The CIA and Special Ops can handle future threats from terrorist cells in Aghanistan and
Packistan.Cut off all aid to Packistan as well.They were hiding that terrorist pig.
Pull all Troops out of Afghanistan and save Billions.
 
 
Yep we went over there to get OBL, he is gone.
We did nt go there to nation build did we? or did we?

Of course it took a Dem CIC to get OBL....

 
 
 
Yep.

Obama has the political capital - it's a perishable item with short shelf life - he should use it. Pull us out of that shithole now, declare victory (because it is) and walk away. I think he would get almost universal support from the folks on that. The hyper-partisans though, no matter. They're not going to support anything he says, does or thinks no matter what. So it's a no-lose scenario both for Obama politically and for the country overall. There's no downside that I can see.

But yeah, let's de-ass Afghanistan with all possible speed.
 
 
And have to re-invade both Pakistan and Afghanistan here in 5 years anyways when we lose a city to one of Pakistan's nukes. Brilliant!

Like it or not, we're in deep with both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Abandon Afghanistan and it'll revert to being a having for drug traders and terrorists and we'll face another major attack based out of there inside a decade. Abandon Pakistan and the extremists will seize control of the government, sell the nukes off to other extremists, and start WWIII with India.

Like it or not, we're in there until we win, or we come back and do it all again.

The Military may leave but the CIA and Civilian "Contractors" will remain. Too much opium to leave in the hands of those backwards cavemen.

Takes a Dem President to keep the opium trade going.

No, we just nuke them right back. No troops needed.

Problem is we will never win.
We can either stay there forever or leave and just come back if they mess with us. Otheriwse leave them alone to their own messes.

ahh a main problem of the right. The learn nothing from history.

but, please keep that train of thought when a repub is in the WH  

Ohh wait it only works one way doesn't it?

bush got us into Afgansitan and kept us there how many years?

We should have just kicked ass in Afganistan for about 6 months and pulled out with the warning of "Mess with us again and we will be back".
We did not even get OBL in Afganistan now did we?

I don't make like to make predictions but here one...

Obama expands the wars if anything... Obama fears the UE spike just before the elections if he ends the wars.

Then I expect everyone to be marching on Washington protesting our continued presence there followed by demands that Obama the war monger, profiteer and baby killer bring our troops home.
Start making your signs, lefties.

I do with as much vigor as I did with Bush.

imho the Afgan operation should have just been a go in and kick AQ's ass for 6 months max and then pull out.

And we should never have invaded Iraq. A preemptive invasion is just so wrong on so many levels.

And I am and have always been against our involvement in Libya.

But what are the odds you will vote for Obama despite him being so close to the same person Bush was? Was it not the pathetic fearful lemmings that helped get Bush a second term, who is going to help get Obama a second term?

Yes, I'm wanting to hear you say if you plan on voting for Obama or not... Of course you can claim you don't reveal whom you vote for. I did a write in for Ron Paul, it means nothing to say who I vote for... Chances are I will end up doing another write in, maybe for Ron Paul, maybe someone else.

over 60.
 
 
I don’t pretend to know if Obama will win or lose, I’d only want him to lose if the candidates running against him were any good and it’s too early to tell if that will happen… Mitt is not a good candidate nor is McCain or Palin for the record.

One thing I feel will probably happen is Obama is going to get his shit wrecked as this round he is no longer “the first black president” to be elected in terms of never having a black person served as president nor is he the anti Bush. He is in a struggle to even get a healthy base to support him. I don’t think the wars, tax credits, bailouts, stimulus’s, Bush tax cuts, torture, high UE, homeland security will be overlooked because of a half assed passed Obamacare.

Obama has managed to surpass any prediction of a “bad job” that many people could have ever predicted as “worst case scenario.” As much as I sit back and call Obama Bush III I can’t help but feel how unfair that is to Bush, Obama is his own person and Obama’s errors and bad choices should be attached to him name alone. If Obama had been president and done these policies without Bush ever being president Obama would be considered the worst president in history by most people, I would think…

Anyways, here’s me trying to be optimistic for the future. =D

I dunno, depends on who runs against him.
As with presidential elections for decades I have voted against the one I have felt would be the worst. I have not actually voted FOR a president since Perot.
 
 
 
 
 
And have to re-invade both Pakistan and Afghanistan here in 5 years anyways when we lose a city to one of Pakistan's nukes. Brilliant!

 

No, we just nuke them right back. No troops needed.

their neighbors to the east would just love all the nuclear fallout on their countries.
India and Pakistan are supp0osed allies of ours. Not a nice way to treat allies.
And both India and Pakistan have "the bomb".

 

And they hate each other. India would probably nuke Pakistan themselves if PK ever used its nukes on anyone. They're just waiting for ANY pretext to do so, just like President Obama told O'Reilly in their first interview.

However the idea that PK would nuke one of our cities, or even could get that job done, is so silly I shouldn't have even answered it. They can't.
 
 
Yep.

Obama has the political capital - it's a perishable item with short shelf life - he should use it. Pull us out of that shithole now, declare victory (because it is) and walk away.

Sure sound good,but how long before the sewer backs up again and another turd like this last one floats up??

 

There's always going to be turds in the overall terrorist punchbowl, doesn't matter where they're headquartered. So what? We can get them without having 50,000 troops or more in the shithole of Afghanistan. That cesspool is not worth one further drop of our blood and not one further dime of our treasure.

Obama has a chance here to truly make transformative change by completely withdrawing from the middle east. This in no way means we won't still be effective against extremists when need be. But we GOT the guy who knocked those buildings down. We are NEVER going to see any secular democratic governments form in the region - they will always be Sharia law, religious based. Those people, like us and like all people in the world have the right of self-determination and just because we might not like what they determine cuts no foss at all. It's THEIR land, their country. And now that we got UBL? Really none of our business anymore either.
 
 
 
 
 
And have to re-invade both Pakistan and Afghanistan here in 5 years anyways when we lose a city to one of Pakistan's nukes. Brilliant!

Like it or not, we're in deep with both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Abandon Afghanistan and it'll revert to being a having for drug traders and terrorists and we'll face another major attack based out of there inside a decade. Abandon Pakistan and the extremists will seize control of the government, sell the nukes off to other extremists, and start WWIII with India.

Like it or not, we're in there until we win, or we come back and do it all again.

 

Problem is we will never win.

 

We did win. Already.

 

We did. OBL- Gone.

And upon our exit? Release thousands of leaflets with pictures of the bloody corpse of OBL with a warning that WE will be back if we are attacked again and this is the fate that awaits them...But the WOT will go on...
 
 
Just wondering if people think the warmongering and nationbuilding should continue, despite Al-Qaeda being out of the country and Osama being dead.

 After Bin Laden Raid, Some Want Out Of Afghanistan : NPR 

Lots of quotes from different politicians here, seems those in Utah get it the most.
 
 
Well at least I got this bumped lol, sorry guys i didn't see this one.
 
 
 
To hell with Nation building.Al qaeda is in Packistan.Osama Bin Laden is dead.
The CIA and Special Ops can handle future threats from terrorist cells in Aghanistan and
Packistan.Cut off all aid to Packistan as well.They were hiding that terrorist pig.
Pull all Troops out of Afghanistan and save Billions.

 

I SUSPECT if Obama pulled the troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq, and if those places didn't immediately fall apart (something I am not entirely sure of) he'd secure his job for another 4 years.

I think there's no shortage of agreement on either side of the great political divide about those wars.

I suspect that the majority of Americans want us OUT of Asia, don't give a fig what happens to those places and would reward Obama for finally doing what should have been done a long time ago.

My only worry is who Obomba's next victim would be if we pull out of Afghanistan and Syria, he's a status quo warmonger who knows where he's going to launch his next horde of cruise missiles, who would have guessed Syria a couple months ago?
 
 
Now that Osama Bin Laden has been eliminated,i believe it's time to bring all of our Cash & Kids back home. Most if not all Pakistan "Foreign Aid" should be rescinded and ended. We can still help Afghanistan out but only in a purely Humanitarian sense. Mission Accomplished. So lets give a big hand for our brave Men & Women in our Military and welcome them Home. This is how i feel anyway. How bout you?

I could not disagree more. Killing Osama did not end the threat from Radical Islamic Terrorism, nor did it end the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Terrorist organizations we are at war with, are still going strong. Killing one man did not put an end to them. Deciding it is over, and packing up shop and going home. Is exactly what our enemies are hoping we will do.
 
 
bin who ? there are wars of conquest to be fought and nation building to be done...no ones going home until the empire falls
 
 
The Afghan War is the longest War in our nation's History. What are the Goals now? What were the Goals originally? These Goals seem to change daily. And now it just seems like some want to keep moving those "Goal" Posts. Bin Laden is gone. Mission Accomplished. Time to bring that Cash and our Kids back Home. And Pakistan can go to Hell. No more "Foreign Aid" for them. There is nothing more to be gained in either Afghanistan or Pakistan. Can't people see that? Should we stay there forever?
 
 
We got the brutal criminals who were responsible for 911. Nothing more to be gained over there. Time to wrap it up for sure.
 
 
Its time we established our energy independence and stopped constantly involving ourselves in foreign wars.
 
 
That's a bleak outlook and i hope you're wrong. But i am hearing Pakistan could be next to be invaded. God lets hope that doesn't happen. We've achieved all we can or should want to achieve other there. Time to come home.

If we have learned anything from the Iraq war its that the devil you know is better than the devil you don't, invading Pakistan would crush the Pakistani Military and basically give the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic extremist groups the power in that country, there are no easy answers. The only reason we are not walking away from Pakistan is because they have nuclear weapons, a unstable country like Pakistan with nukes doesn't do anyone any good. I definently want us out of Afghanistan but it can't happen right away, a transfer of power has to take place and that can take years unfortunatly, even in Iraq people are debating behind the scenes about keeping some troops there for a longer time. We definently need to take another look at our billion dollar aid packages to Pakistan though because right now they look complacent and incompetent.
 
 
 
 
 
Now that Osama Bin Laden has been eliminated,i believe it's time to bring all of our Cash & Kids back home. Most if not all Pakistan "Foreign Aid" should be rescinded and ended. We can still help Afghanistan out but only in a purely Humanitarian sense. Mission Accomplished. So lets give a big hand for our brave Men & Women in our Military and welcome them Home. This is how i feel anyway. How bout you?

 

I could not disagree more. Killing Osama did not end the threat from Radical Islamic Terrorism, nor did it end the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Terrorist organizations we are at war with, are still going strong. Killing one man did not put an end to them. Deciding it is over, and packing up shop and going home. Is exactly what our enemies are hoping we will do.

 

Those were the goals originally in Afghanistan? I thought it was to get those responsible for 911? Looks like some are always trying to move the "Goal" Posts. We got the Bastards responsible,now lets get the Hell out of there. And to Hell with Pakistan too. Time to rescind and end "Foreign Aid" to them. Bring the Cash & Kids Home. It's time.

 

We got ourselves tied up with nation building in Afghanistan now, that project can take decades because Afghanistan is so backwards.
 
 
Screw the Nation Building in Afghanistan & Iraq. Pull the troops out & move into Pakistan & Iran for a quick 6 month hard hitting Al Qaeda extermination, take their Nukes away & then bring all troops home.

That's what they said Iraq and Afghanistan would be, they were given a leash and took a mile long piece of rope.

None of the above I say.

You make it sound so easy, unfortunatly it is not. An adventure like that would have casualty rates so high it would make our casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan look like nothing.

I know, but they could do this & be out of there by the 2012 election or get voted out. I say it's time to quit playing with the Middle East & Get-R-Done!

The high casualty rates came from all the time we spent being policemen trying to win hearts & minds. It's time to blast our way out of there. Best to just weaken Iran so they don't take over Iraq instead of trying to rebuild Iraq so they can defend against Iran.

We can't afford to stay there 10+ more years playing policeman doing some shit that might not work. Those idiots have been killing each-other for 3,000 years. What the hell can we do to stop them? If you want the oil that bad just Nuke the place & kill them all. It will not contaminate the Crude Oil.
