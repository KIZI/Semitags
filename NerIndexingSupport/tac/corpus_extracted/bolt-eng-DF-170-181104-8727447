May I present to the American people, President Barack Obama!
 
 
sorry...but how the hell are they calling states with less than 20% returns?

I hate when they do that shit. It gives me flashbacks to 2000 living in FL when they called it for Gore and then snatched that shit back!

That was because Fox News who had a bush family member running the show that night declared Florida for Bush. Then the other stations followed like sheep after declaring it for Gore.

He's up 13 points and Cleveland hasn't reported a vote (13% of the population)...

that's a good point.
 
 
No folks this is really happening.

Hes crushing McCrusty
 
 
Here's something that will blow your mind.

If Obama really won Ohio, all he needs is California, Hawaii, and Washington State. That gives him 270 EC votes. He could lose everything else.

you guys don't scare me, never have never will. I can say proudly that I never trashed Obama's family. Too bad you yokels cannot say the same. Last word on the subject. If you guys (and I mean the Democratic party and the left) had won this race with honor and dignity and not with the hate and smear and divisive class warfare and race warfare I would have been glad to celebrate this with you. Can't do it tho. Too much water under the bridge. it's been a long eight years. Enjoy your President. I'll wait.

Not Hillsborough, but Pinelles and Orange... Orange county went VERY blue.
