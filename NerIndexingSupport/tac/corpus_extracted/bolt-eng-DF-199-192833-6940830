 
 
Duke Wins ACC Tournament.... Again
 
 
Boston College put up one hell of a good game.... but no one can touch my mutha phuckin Blue Devils.....
 
 
yeah, that was a good game. Redick finally seemed to come out of his slump. The refs were defintley letting 'em play tough down low.

I'm suprised BC got a number #3 seed and Carolina a #2 seed, since BC beat them twice.
 
 
The Blue Devils are beatable, as FSU and UNC proved during the final week of the regular season.

UConn is the team to beat in the NCAAs. I have spoken!
 
 
I agree - Duke is too outmatched size-wise to beat UConn.
 
 
HUSKIES!!!
 
 
anyone can be beaten.....
 
 
...but I'm a Tarheel, born 'n bred...
 
 
I got an uncle, he's TarHeel Fred...
 
 
Congrats to your Devils, Bear. That was a helluva game. Would have been a different story vs. the Heels tho. :wink:

My sister is a UNC alumnus, and I lived there for most of the first 20 years of my life. Followed them from Charlie Scott to Phil Ford to Bob Macadoo to Michael Jordan to now.

Go Heels!!
