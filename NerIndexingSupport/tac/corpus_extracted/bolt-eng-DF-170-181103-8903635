You are a modern-day thinker.

Thanks for sharing.
 
 
Probably the smartest man among the current gop field.

Race has everything to do with it if you are a liberal like Plasmaball.

Not really. My posts are not racist at all.
Two reasons why people like him
1) he's black
2) says what you like to hear.

thats it. He is a vessel to justify your opinions. His name just happens to be Cain.

Certain Dems keeping saying tea party people are racists.
Herman Cain is a favorite of tea party people.
That's why.

Maybe his mommy couldn't give him a ride that day?
 
 
So liberals don't like him because he's black and conservative.

Color me surprised.

no I wrote my own name in actually. Obama and Mccain were not willing to cut the things i wanted nor run the government the way i want. They are rather too democrat for my tastes...Well Mccain was a sell out honestly.

You dismiss him as an accomplished black man that many might admire for a variety of reasons, because he is black, and therefore token.

You are making him token.

And calling us racist while doing so.

Plasticballs is one of USMB's premier bigots.... that's what he does.
 
 
Herman Cain is a real American conservative capitalist. Don't you all know that means he's a racist. Uh, ah, wait a minute..........hold on.......Um......never mind.

for some sure, but we have a lot of evidence that the right has a lot of racists in the party. This is a way of downplaying that angle.
 
 
Sure... Obama's the left's token black. Look how the left treats any minority that doesn't play ball.

Shutup you filthy racist.
 
 
Ran his own Business,Conservative beliefs? Sounds pretty good to me. Probably exactly what this country needs right now. I'll have to study up on him some more though.
 
 
IÂ’m torn, Cain seems ok at best, very weak candidate but I agree with a good amount of what he says. I like Ron Paul and Cain seems to be a less informative version of RP. The problem I see if they pull much of the same vote, meaning that Cain takes from RP and RP takes votes from CainÂ…

I get the feeling they might end up cancelling each other out in the primaries allowing someone like a Mitt to grab the nomination and further erode the party into a hole of lack of true conservative representation.

A Cain/Paul ticket would be awesome thoughÂ… Again IÂ’d like Paul to head the ticket as he has all the experience and I think Cain would make 1 hell of a VP during the GE. I simply think it would be a much weaker ticket the other way around and further more who else could Cain pick that wouldnÂ’t be a full on neocon? That would lose my vote instantly.
 
 
You on the left vote for who you think is best for our country based on ideology and what the person is saying of how he or she will run this country.
Same for those on the right.
People will vote for him based on his ideology and how he will run this country.
Not what color he is.
 
 
He also ran the KC Federal Reserve! HE IS THE ENEMY!

You call me a fucktard when you're the one who's racists comments have backed himself into a corner...

You seem to be the very definition of racist.

What are the rights options according to you then? Never like or vote for a person that is not white or it's a racist vote? Cain was very liked before he ever even announced any intentions to run for president, he had huge support from just speaking at events.

You bigot.

Cain was talking with Hannity on yesterday's radio show. (I caught a bit while commuting...) He said he would like Ryan or Rubio as VP picks, but that those two men were committed to serving their respective terms out in their states.

I'm trying to remember who he did mention. Bachmann was one (which won't make too many people happy), the other two were good picks. Pawlenty and McConnell? That could be totally off... I couldn't find mention of the interview online yet.

and you are full of shit. Color has everything to do with this as much as ideology.
You are just to much of a fucking pussy to actually admit it.

Thats the problem woth the right and left. You guys sit in your comfortable fake realities and cant actually have an objective look at your own parties.

There is always excuses.

I'm ok with voting for a successful Businessman with Conservative beliefs. Cain has real life-experience in running Businesses,unlike most who are running the country right now. If he wins the GOP Nomination,i'll vote for him.

He's traveling all over the country talking to whomever will listen. How does that make his audience selective?

lol thats sad. My comments have nothing to do with my personal beliefs on race. This has to do with the overall aspect of the GOP and the loud fringe Cain is subjecting himself too.

Do give up on the " you are a racist" crap, you are not going to prove that point at all. Dont get me wrong, you are doing it because you have no argument against my opinion, so you need to make it personal to downplay my opinion.

Seen it done by better and smarter.

traveling has nothing to do with it. The people who is targeting is spread all over this nation. So what? That proves nothing beyond they are spread out.

Really you are going to try to make a point out of selective audience and this is your argument? Fuck you this is just insulting stupid.

You a very blinded by your own ideology.You believed the left that the tea party is racist and you can not stand it that the majority of them are not.
I like his ideology and his background.
Guess what? While he was on the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City it did very well just like all of the businesses did while he was running them.
 
 
Yeah a guy who ran a business in a sector that depends on low wage, low benefit, low job security labor for its success...

...that's just what America needs, because we certainly don't have enough of that already.
 
 
Herman Cain ran his own Businesses and understands that spending $14.5 Trillion more than you took in is a shocking disgrace. Looks like the Dummies running our Country right now haven't figured that out yet. If Cain does win the GOP Nomination,i'll definitely support him.

Hmmm
I didn't know that Coca Cola and Pillsbury were low wage,low benefits and low job security.
 
 
OK, anyone who is really involved in the racial aspect needs to sit and do some self examination time. The important issues are competence, skill, knowledge and history of accomplishment.

Herman Cain is fun to listen to, he has been writing on economic matter for a long time, he has turned two struggling business to profitability.(OK, so the pizza sucks, but the folks who work there still have jobs and the business is solvent)

He is appealing to tea party people like me because he tells us what we want to hear out of a politician. I think some of his religious views are slightly weird, but I feel that about everyone religious views.

When he gives a speech, he lights fires. He does not have a history of revolving beds like Gingrich (who I also like) he does not have Masscare in his resume like Romney, nor does he have a catch and release policy on violent criminals like Huckabee.

And his very existence pisses off the left. But that is just icing on a very sweet cake.

You might actually have a point if people were forced into those jobs and required to work those jobs indefinitely.

These people should just quit and go on funemployment.

As I knew what to expect from the LWNs, I skipped the majority of this thread.
I'm sure they gonna start calling him Boy and other derogatory things very soon - after all, he poses a direct threat to The Anointed One.

From the poor selection so far, he's got my vote. I have no doubt he'll end up on the ticket as VP.

     
 
 
How many conservatives want to see Cain's birth certificate?

He would be an excellent VP candidate, but it's way too early to already count him down and out as the GOP nominee.

To his critics so far:

1) He's black! Yes he is. He has to be something though doesn't he? I'm guessing that if he was purple with pink polka dots, he would have generated interest with the message he has been delivering.

2) He's socially conservative!! Yes he is. And he is honest and up front on every issue he is asked about. But remember, the President has no power to initiate legislation. And I'm pretty sure Herman Cain won't be doing end runs around the Congress and Constitution. I'm pretty sure any controversial issue that comes up will be put out there honestly, in the open, and for full review and debate. I think most people aren't afraid of that. At least he deserves a chance.

3) He appeals to the Tea Party. Yes he does. Isn't that wonderful? That means he isn't a tyrannical social ideologue but is committed to fiscal integrity, lower taxes, and personal freedom.

4) He favors a national sales tax to replace the income tax. That's the only significant issue I'm disagreeing with him so far as I am a flat tax advocate and will need a lot of convincing before I'll think a national sales tax would be a good thing. I do think his track record suggests a course change though if a better idea comes along.

5) On our involvement in foreign policy he is laying our his terms: a) The mission has to be clearly stated; b) there has to be a workable plan in place to accomplish the mission; c) there has to be agreement on what success of the mission will be. If those three things aren't in place we don't do it. If we don't have those three things in place in Iraq and Afganistan, for instance, we bring our troops home.

It's too early to know how Cain will stand up under the pressures and hatefulness of a national campaign, but if he proves to be for real, I am finding myself liking him a lot.
 
 
 
 
gop just got their black friend...sad

Plasma hates blacks and poor people. That's why he's a democrat. The Dems are the party of hate for minorities.

5) On our involvement in foreign policy he is laying our his terms: a) The mission has to be clearly stated; b) there has to be a workable plan in place to accomplish the mission; c) there has to be agreement on what success of the mission will be. If those three things aren't in place we don't do it. If we don't have those three things in place in Iraq and Afganistan, for instance, we bring our troops home.

It's too early to know how Cain will stand up under the pressures and hatefulness of a national campaign, but if he proves to be for real, I am finding myself liking him a lot.

 

I have a lot of respect for Cain. I will watch him with interest. We could do worse - in fact, we currently are doing worse.  
 
 
 
You dismiss him as an accomplished black man that many might admire for a variety of reasons, because he is black, and therefore token.

You are making him token.

 

Well that was completely predictable. I knew as soon as Cain started gaining momentum after the South Carolina debate that he would be called a token because he's black. The Democrats treated Michael Steele the same way.
 
 
 
 
You on the left vote for who you think is best for our country based on ideology and what the person is saying of how he or she will run this country.
Same for those on the right.
People will vote for him based on his ideology and how he will run this country.
Not what color he is.

 

and you are full of shit. Color has everything to do with this as much as ideology.
You are just to much of a fucking pussy to actually admit it.

Thats the problem woth the right and left. You guys sit in your comfortable fake realities and cant actually have an objective look at your own parties.

There is always excuses.

 

Only in your mind.

I agree. He's intriguing, but I have to know more about him still. If he's going to be a big social zealot like Huckabee or that douche bag Santorum then I'll pass.
 
 
 
 
 
but i didnt vote for Obama in the 08 election.

But then you are a moron so i dont expect you to actually say anything worth while

 

Sure you didn't.  

Unless you skipped voting altogether because you were busy.  

 

Maybe his mommy couldn't give him a ride that day?

 

He was only 11 in '08.

Yep. And Clarence Thomas. And Condoleeza Rice. And Colin Powell. and J.P. Watts. And Alan Keyes et al. The initial theme was the same: they were nominated or chosen because they were black. And if their enemies couldn't marginalize them that way, they were maliciously and visciously attacked in many other hateful ways. A strong conservative black man or woman seems to be a real threat to some on the left.

I'm still waiting for Martin Luther King's dream of America when people are not judged by the color of their skin first. And while of course there are exceptions on all sides, I think the right overall is doing a much better job of that than is the left.

Just look how any minority, or woman, is treated if they stray too far from the liberal plantation.
 
 
 
 
 
Not really. My posts are not racist at all.
Two reasons why people like him
1) he's black
2) says what you like to hear.

thats it. He is a vessel to justify your opinions. His name just happens to be Cain.

 

Same thing for those who are for President Obama

 

for some sure, but we have a lot of evidence that the right has a lot of racists in the party. This is a way of downplaying that angle.

 

There's far more evidence of racism in the Democratic party, idjut!

Good point. Conservative Hispanics suffer as much personal attacks as conservative blacks. Anybody who steps outside the designated box is seen as fair game to go after, but minorities and women are especially expected to toe the party line or they will be taken down.
 
 
 
Your thoughts?

 

Paul/Cain 2012! or Cain/Paul 2012! Either ticket is fine with me.

I'm done with the Republican Party. If they nominate Romney or Perry I'm just gonna' write in someone else.

You seem to be the only one obsessed with the color of his skin. Who is the racist in this thread?

 

lol thats sad. My comments have nothing to do with my personal beliefs on race. This has to do with the overall aspect of the GOP and the loud fringe Cain is subjecting himself too.

Do give up on the " you are a racist" crap, you are not going to prove that point at all. Dont get me wrong, you are doing it because you have no argument against my opinion, so you need to make it personal to downplay my opinion.

Seen it done by better and smarter.

I'm a republican and I voted for Obama. It's not my fault the idiot powers that be in the GOP put a nitwit on the ticket a heatbeat from the white house. I had no other choice. I saw Palin as a clear and present danger and was not going to do anything to improve her chances.

The president is a leader. He doesn't create legislation...he can't really do anything about many things people believe he is responsible for. I am not naive like that. What the president DOES do is from time to time act on his own judgment with the military. I would trust Powell to make the right calls.

For sure. Powell's still kind of got that stigma for being involved in the second Iraq war, especially that presentation at the UN, but he goes back before the Bush admin and it would seem unfair if he were lumped in with Wolfowitz and Cheney and Rumsfeld etc. I don't remember him being that lock-step with them.

And he definitely has leadership experience and doesn't come across as a partisan mouthbreather--just the opposite. I think he could give Obama a real run for his money.
 
 
I just saw Herman Cain's announcement today on the news. I've actually never heard of him before. After some research though I think I prefer him over a lot of the other candidates running. Right now, until I see otherwise I think I'm supporting him.

Paradox much? Obama was a far worse choice than Palin. At least Palin had experience in politics. Obama was a celebrity who by far enjoyed the camera and attention side of poltics more so than the actual work he would have needed to perform. I saw Obama as a problem early on and I chose the lesser of two evils, with that said I was amazed in 2008 when America overwhelmingly elected an inexperienced celebrity to office.....who has ceaselessly disgraced the office of the President and defied the will of the citizens since. If I we're you....I'd never admit you voted in that direction...

I think America is ready to elect a black man as President. All whites and one mulatto so far.
 
 
..........I think America is ready to move past color and elect a real leader personally. I don't care if we elect a freakin smurf as long as he can competently preform the job....

Perhaps, but she made it further than any conservative woman has been allowed to. A conservative woman is going to be excoriated, disminished, accused, hated, and destroyed no matter who she is. You can't point to a single conservative woman in the public politic in which that has not been the case.

That seems to be the prevailing theory among the loonier of the left.
 
 
 
 
IÂ’m torn, Cain seems ok at best, very weak candidate but I agree with a good amount of what he says. I like Ron Paul and Cain seems to be a less informative version of RP. The problem I see if they pull much of the same vote, meaning that Cain takes from RP and RP takes votes from CainÂ…

I get the feeling they might end up cancelling each other out in the primaries allowing someone like a Mitt to grab the nomination and further erode the party into a hole of lack of true conservative representation.

A Cain/Paul ticket would be awesome thoughÂ… Again IÂ’d like Paul to head the ticket as he has all the experience and I think Cain would make 1 hell of a VP during the GE. I simply think it would be a much weaker ticket the other way around and further more who else could Cain pick that wouldnÂ’t be a full on neocon? That would lose my vote instantly.

 

Cain was talking with Hannity on yesterday's radio show. (I caught a bit while commuting...) He said he would like Ryan or Rubio as VP picks, but that those two men were committed to serving their respective terms out in their states.

I'm trying to remember who he did mention. Bachmann was one (which won't make too many people happy), the other two were good picks. Pawlenty and McConnell? That could be totally off... I couldn't find mention of the interview online yet.

 

Yeah, that pretty much lost my vote lol... All he did was name drop "big names" but shitty names at that. I mean Ryan? Lol, that guys a fucking sissy bitch.

  What's in the center? 
 
 
It is weird because the only noise I hear (not saying there is none on the right) about Cain's skin color comes from the left... Cain and Ron Paul were the 2 most liked people in the first debate and received lots of positive support from the crowd, no one stood up and yelled !Nigger! Like it seems some might want us to believe.

Yes, but in his defense, Hannity is the one that dropped Rubio and Ryan. He just said that they aren't even in the running.

I like what I know of Ryan to a large degree, but he isn't running, so I'm not paying too much attention to him right now beyond his budget proposal.

I actually like Bachmann. I think she risks getting skewered more than Palin, however, so in my opinion, she has no chance.

Probably surprising to some is that I like Romney. I think he has a strong business background, and his attempt at addressing health insurance/care in his state doesn't offend my sensibilities. The state level is where those issues SHOULD be addressed, not at the federal level.

I personally wouldn't put Cain at the top of the ticket. I think he would do better to serve as VP and go from there, imo.

I might be misunderstanding your post. You think that Romney can't win the nomination? He seems like he is starting to get his campaign going right now in a pretty remarkable manner.
 
 
At this point, gut level, I fear that Romney is going to be the nominee by default as the vote is split among everybody else. That is how McCain got in. And I think the electorate will be just as unenthused about voting for Romney as they were Mc Cain.

At least Herman Cain at this point does not generate those kinds of feelings for me. One of the points he made was that everybody else we've elected lately has had political experience. And how is that working out for us?

Unless something comes up that I don't see now, I wouldn't have to hold my nose to vote for Cain.
 
 
i'm sorry, herman cain doesn't have the media presence to win an election. i wouldn't vote for him regardless, but his speech mannerisms are jarring enough that i doubt he'd be able to capture much of the vote.

I personally don't know how McCain got in, except that the left promoted him like crazy and then once nominated, tied him to Bush.

And to the bolded point above, Obama didn't have experience, so he is a little off on that one.

I just like Romney's business sense more than anyone else at this moment in time. I want to see someone that knows how to make good fiscal decisions, which Romney has done. If you look at Wiki, it lists he business career. Pretty much a superstar throughout his life. I probably know less about his politics as opposed to his business history, but I will be taking a look at him. Our economy is in need of being rescued.

I could rally around a Romney/Cain ticket. Both have proven themselves in the real world, not just in the halls of capitol buildings.
 
 
I'm still praying for a Palin/Bachman ticket.

Please God.....
 
 
I am still at a loss how McCain got in. I never saw much enthusiasm for the guy.
 
 
 
I'm still praying for a Palin/Bachman ticket.

Please God.....

 

So it's "Chris" as in "Chris Matthews"?  
 
 
 
 
At this point, gut level, I fear that Romney is going to be the nominee by default as the vote is split among everybody else. That is how McCain got in. And I think the electorate will be just as unenthused about voting for Romney as they were Mc Cain.

At least Herman Cain at this point does not generate those kinds of feelings for me. One of the points he made was that everybody else we've elected lately has had political experience. And how is that working out for us?

Unless something comes up that I don't see now, I wouldn't have to hold my nose to vote for Cain.

 

I personally don't know how McCain got in, except that the left promoted him like crazy and then once nominated, tied him to Bush.

And to the bolded point above, Obama didn't have experience, so he is a little off on that one.

I just like Romney's business sense more than anyone else at this moment in time. I want to see someone that knows how to make good fiscal decisions, which Romney has done. If you look at Wiki, it lists he business career. Pretty much a superstar throughout his life. I probably know less about his politics as opposed to his business history, but I will be taking a look at him. Our economy is in need of being rescued.

I could rally around a Romney/Cain ticket. Both have proven themselves in the real world, not just in the halls of capitol buildings.

 

Well Obama was in the Illinois State Senate for several years and in the U.S. Senate for two, albeit mostly absentee. So he does have some political experience.

Lack of political experience won't bother me so much with a person with the right values and who I trust to stick to those values and who has a good track record for choosing good people to surround himself with. What somebody lacks in expertise, they wisely choose people to work with who can fill in those deficiencies.

Romney at gut level I don't really trust to be operating on conviction or values he will stick with. He sometimes seems to say what people want to hear when the overall track record doesn't support his words as conviction. I haven't heard Cain waffle on anything yet, but admittedly it is still early in the political season. Cain does also bring the heavy duty business experience though.

But I would vote for a conservative Mickey Mouse over Barack Obama as I am ready to start slowing down and reversing this runaway debt train we're now on. Even if Mickey Mouse is Romney.

But I wouldn't enjoy voting for Romney as much as something I really did think was the right guy.
 
 
 
Sure... Obama's the left's token black. Look how the left treats any minority that doesn't play ball.

 

Bingo
 
 
 
 
You dismiss him as an accomplished black man that many might admire for a variety of reasons, because he is black, and therefore token.

You are making him token.

 

Well that was completely predictable. I knew as soon as Cain started gaining momentum after the South Carolina debate that he would be called a token because he's black. The Democrats treated Michael Steele the same way.

 

I thought you rightwing nuts didn't care for the race card.
 
 
 
Probably the smartest man among the current gop field.

 

Newt is the smartest.

Just check out his education.

I think he's the only candidate with a PHD.
 
 
 
So let me get this straight. Republicans are racists for opposing Obama but are supporting Cain because he's a token black guy. Did I get that right?

 

No.

We hate Cain because we hate strong conservative women.

We care about it. Especially when you on the left starts showing your hypocrisy.

I'm waiting for the usual shit:

He's a token black
He's an Uncle Tom
He's not an authentic Afro-American
He's not a Democrat, thus not down for the struggle

It never fails you hypocrites.
 
 
 
 
 
So what?

I'm a republican and I voted for Obama. It's not my fault the idiot powers that be in the GOP put a nitwit on the ticket a heatbeat from the white house. I had no other choice. I saw Palin as a clear and present danger and was not going to do anything to improve her chances.

The president is a leader. He doesn't create legislation...he can't really do anything about many things people believe he is responsible for. I am not naive like that. What the president DOES do is from time to time act on his own judgment with the military. I would trust Powell to make the right calls.

 

That's some smart thinking, Tex. I guess you listened closely to Obama's agenda prior to your vote.

Brilliant.

 

Whatever PeggySue... Palin was not and is not qualified to be the leader of the free world. Period.

 

And barack obama or Joe Biden is?

Glad to see you can admit you hate him.

Guess he's left the plantation.....so to you he's just an uppity nigger.
 
 
 
I am still at a loss how McCain got in. I never saw much enthusiasm for the guy.

 

Given how 2008 was shaping up, and that a democratic win was likely, they needed someone to take the fall. YouÂ’d think after 2000 and 2008 McCain would get the idea heÂ’s hated by most fellow republicans.

Which makes zero sense since Plasmaball is the one that introduced it into the thread.

Maybe you could PM him and tell him he makes liberals look like idiots.

You playing along to try and cover up the fact of the bigotry in this thread says as much about you as it does about his initial floundering, from which he ultimately fled.

I wonder if he thinks that restaurants should have the right to refuse service to black people,

like the true Tea Partiers Rand and Ron Paul.

Doubtful.

Newt explained his position later and it seems everyone overreacted.

Besides, you lying assholes love being for and against issues at the same time.

Example: Newt showed he wasn't all in on the Ryan plan so you make fun of him for it, but for some strange reason you're not for the Ryan plan ether.

Makes sense only to a Liberal.

It's so easy to be a lib. You don't need reason or common-sense, just an active imagination.

After all, the easiest thing there is to do is make fun of everyone else, even though you don't have any answers yourself.

It's apparent that the ENTIRE liberal strategy this election cycle is trying to demean anyone not liberal. They have nothing to offer, and they know that their policies are toxic, so this is all they have left.

and then claiming that anyone who quoted his original statements would be lying about him.

I make fun of anyone who thinks that Newt Gingrich is was or ever will be a viable candidate for president.

I make fun of anyone who's bought the myth that Gingrich is some sort of genius.

Yeah, yea...Newt called and apologized to Ryan, but according to you he was misquoted even after he admitted to Ryan that he made a mistake. Newt blew it. He is a loser and may as well join Trump on the sidelines.

I've listened to him explain his statements fully, and have discovered that most have taken his statements out of context.

None of the quotes you claim to base this off of have only one possible meaning.

Since I doubt you have even taken the time to listen to him since that Sunday morning interview there is no way you can understand what he meant.

I listened to the interview live. None of the assumptions I keep hearing were accurate. The plan of attack Gregory tried to go on was that Newt was a racist, but instead the right jumped on him because he wasn't completely sold on the Ryan plan. So now the left is running with that, and it's really just a misinterpretation of what he meant.

It would be interesting to see how blacks would vote given 2 black candidates.

I'm a TEA party supporter I have no problem voting for a black, a Hispanic, an oriental or an Arab, as long as his values are reasonably close to mine. I do have a problem voting for a lying sack of shit socialist, no matter what color his skin.

Why do you insist on calling people tea baggers? Are you homophobic? Or just a faggot?

What many around here have so soon forgotten was the dire situation our country was in as Obama took office. Things could indeed have turned out much worse. Obama did what he had to do.. He didn't do anything radical. He basically turned the tide on the financial crisis. There is still a lot of pain to endure but I don't see how he made things worse than they were. The wars are winding down..Osama has been killed..the economy is improving..the stock market has recovered. Ignoring these positive outcomes is ignorant. I didn't expect much more from Obama.

Didn't do anything radical? Privatizing banks and auto manufacturers was not radical? Passing a stimulus package that added almost a trillion to the deficit while used mostly to shore up government jobs when we were already awash in dangerous red ink wasn't radical? Signing an appropriations bill loaded with pork that further added to the deficit when Candidate Obama had adamently promised he wouldn't do that wasn't radical? Obamacare most especially when hundreds of waivers exempting his friends and supporters from its provisions have now been issued wasn't radical? Instead of paying down the deficit, quietly turning repaid TARP monies into a petty cash fund to be allocated again and again wasn't radical?

And you apparently haven't been watching the stock market for the past couple of weeks. Not much recovery there.

The crappy economy he inherited was not his fault, and I don't blame Obama for everything and I give him props when he gets it right. But we are now into the third year of his Presidency and he has badly mismanaged the economy and, based on his own words, he apparently intends to keep right on mismanaging it. And a lot of it has been pretty radical and alarming to a lot of us.

Radical change is still radical no matter what your perspective is.

His perspective is that this is the way things should be. His opinions are radically different from most of America.

You know, I used to think people like him didn't exist. Most of America thinks he's someone's imagination.
 
 
 
 
 
Not really. My posts are not racist at all.
Two reasons why people like him
1) he's black
2) says what you like to hear.

thats it. He is a vessel to justify your opinions. His name just happens to be Cain.

 

Same thing for those who are for President Obama

 

for some sure, but we have a lot of evidence that the right has a lot of racists in the party. This is a way of downplaying that angle.

 

Your President is a racist. He used race when he campaigned the first time for President............."They're gonna tell you I'm black".............

As if they had to be told.

Even a blindman knows Obama is Black, or at least from some ethnic group just by listening to his name.

I don't really see that he's black anyway. I don't see his color, only that he's an asshole.

The collapse of the economy as Obama took office drove the NYSE from 14,000 to just over 6,000. It has gained back 6,500 pts. I call that an amazing recovery in that a lot of the 14,000 pts was bubble. Denying this fact is willful ignorance. The value of the NYSE has nearly doubled in two years in the rebound of the worst financial shock this country has ever seen....you don't think that is astounding? I do. The truth is..that the recovery of the NYSE has been historic...unprecedented..

Sorry I can't joint your pack of nitwit hyenas...

You dismiss him as an accomplished black man that many might admire for a variety of reasons, because he is black, and therefore token.

Well that was completely predictable. I knew as soon as Cain started gaining momentum after the South Carolina debate that he would be called a token because he's black. The Democrats treated Michael Steele the same way.

 

I thought you rightwing nuts didn't care for the race card.

 

I don't understand what you mean.  
 
 
 
 
 
On which ticket?

Now watch Plamaball run in here and claim I am slamming Powell because he is black.  

 

I would like to see a Powell/Rice ticket win for the GOP.

 

Powell has proven himself a lib. If you want him on the ticket, change your party to D and encourage him to join you.

 

Why would I seeing how you threw him under the bus.he's not.nut.enough for.you.

The crappy economy he inherited was not his fault, and I don't blame Obama for everything and I give him props when he gets it right. But we are now into the third year of his Presidency and he has badly mismanaged the economy and, based on his own words, he apparently intends to keep right on mismanaging it. And a lot of it has been pretty radical and alarming to a lot of us.

 

The collapse of the economy as Obama took office drove the NYSE from 14,000 to just over 6,000. It has gained back 6,500 pts. I call that an amazing recovery in that a lot of the 14,000 pts was bubble. Denying this fact is willful ignorance. The value of the NYSE has nearly doubled in two years in the rebound of the worst financial shock this country has ever seen....you don't think that is astounding? I do. The truth is..that the recovery of the NYSE has been historic...unprecedented..

Astounding? Well, all the nitwit hyenas (aka credible economists) I've been reading are pretty well agreed on a couple of things I think you might not be considering.

Here's one point of view that is pretty well agreed among all:

 
Unprecedented monetary and fiscal policies have created an economic recovery that is artificial to an indeterminate degree. Similarly, the massive rally in the stock market of the past two years has been built to an uncomfortably large extent on the shaky ground of extraordinary government intervention in the form of $1.5 trillion annual fiscal deficits and over $2 trillion of Federal Reserve asset purchase programs. Aside from job creation, which has been consistently disappointing, U.S. economic data have generally surprised on the upside over the past several months, but how the economy performs once stimulus begins to be withdrawn after the second quarter is an open question.

The daily numbers don't ever tell the whole story. With interest rates at effectively zero, and real estate losing ground every month, the market is the only place investors have to go. Much of the boom is driven by high oil prices and as those have slowly been coming down, the market has been following. We'll know soon enough how much of the 'rally' has been on oil speculators.

In short, any Obama policies that have affected the market have been largely artificial and short term.
 
 
 
 
I hope he provides a birth certificate......otherwise Trump will be mad at him

 

I bet he has it locked and loaded and ready to show anybody who wants to see it. I bet ALL the candidates, from ALL parties, have their birth certificates ready to go.

 

Since NOW its an issue. Never before but for some reason, now its a thing. Once again, this is the first time something happens under this administration...

Funny huh.
 
 
 
 
 
Didn't do anything radical? Privatizing banks and auto manufacturers was not radical? Passing a stimulus package that added almost a trillion to the deficit while used mostly to shore up government jobs when we were already awash in dangerous red ink wasn't radical? Signing an appropriations bill loaded with pork that further added to the deficit when Candidate Obama had adamently promised he wouldn't do that wasn't radical? Obamacare most especially when hundreds of waivers exempting his friends and supporters from its provisions have now been issued wasn't radical? Instead of paying down the deficit, quietly turning repaid TARP monies into a petty cash fund to be allocated again and again wasn't radical?

Hardly.

The stimulus and the bailout saved the country from another Great Depression. When an economy is in a deflationary spiral, the government has to be the demand of last resort. Congress and the President realized this and did the right thing.

Likewise, the rescue of GM turned it into a profitable company again.

Obama has done a very good job, and Bush did not.

It helps to have a smart president, my friends.

Let's say we just treat Cain the same way the Right treated Obama, racially speaking. Will you Cain fans accept that as fair? Seeing how you defended the stuff thrown at Obama,

like the watermelon stuff, the gorilla stuff, the witch doctor stuff, etc., etc.

You managed find reasons to excuse all that and give it a pass, so in fairness, you should give anyone on the left or wherever a pass on anything of the sort they throw at Cain.

You wouldn't want to be hypocrites now, would you?

I won't get into a food fight with you Huggy. I don't get into food fights with anybody. So I'm happy to agree to disagree.

But you're wrong.

Yes, but in his defense, Hannity is the one that dropped Rubio and Ryan. He just said that they aren't even in the running.

I like what I know of Ryan to a large degree, but he isn't running, so I'm not paying too much attention to him right now beyond his budget proposal.

I actually like Bachmann. I think she risks getting skewered more than Palin, however, so in my opinion, she has no chance.

Probably surprising to some is that I like Romney. I think he has a strong business background, and his attempt at addressing health insurance/care in his state doesn't offend my sensibilities. The state level is where those issues SHOULD be addressed, not at the federal level.

I personally wouldn't put Cain at the top of the ticket. I think he would do better to serve as VP and go from there, imo.

 

I agree, but not that Mitt has any chance at on the President level.

 

I might be misunderstanding your post. You think that Romney can't win the nomination? He seems like he is starting to get his campaign going right now in a pretty remarkable manner.

 

I'm saying Mitt will be worse than McCain was. To many people don't like him and don't like him a lot.

Go ahead. The racist shit on the right was few and far between but if you feel the urge deep down inside of you to open up your racist side to the world be my guest.

Maybe we can take racist shit that's being said now by the fringe Obamabot left and apply it to all liberals kinda like you seem to want to do with that fringe right back in 2008 and make all conservatives out to be a bunch of racist supporting Nazis.

Once again, donÂ’t hold back, call Cain all the names you know you really want to.

ItÂ’s fun watching all this because itÂ’s so clear to see that the fringe left is losing their minds over the fact that the right just is not even a 10th as racist as they try feverishly to make them out to be. Like Rtard does every single day.

Like i said Cain is your ticket to showing how not racist the GOP teatards are. Saw it a mile away.
 
 
 
I hope he provides a birth certificate......otherwise Trump will be mad at him

 

He has no idiot relations who claim they assisted at the birth overseas. Obama should have deported his aunt for that one. The whole stupid would have died in second if it hand't been for her.

He also hasn't been educated overseas in a school that required local citizenship in order to attend.

Who has been making watermelon jokes? I have not noticed them. Or the gorilla stuff. That is new to me as well. That really can't be a racial slur though. Lincoln got that from his own generals. I don't see how Obama should get a pass on that if Lincoln didn't.

Anyway, Cain was born in Memphis TN and has a long record of accomplishment. The only thing the left can do about the man is make fun of his pizza. But the company did well under his leadership.

We haven't bought pizza in years--we buy frozen or make our own--but I recall that Godfathers was really good pizza too.
 
 
I am very excited Cain made it official. I watched his speech at his rally. I can't wait to see how he does in the field. Right now he doesn't have a great shot but things change in a hurry. Look at the last presidential election. Gulianni was the heavy early favorite of the GOP with over 50%. We all saw how that worked out.

Cain is a brilliant man. Extremely intelligent. He would do wonders for this country. Now that Trump is out him and Palin are my 2 favorites.
 
 
I haven't been this excited since Bobby Jindal became the new Fred Thompson.

How does that work? Basically your telling all of us that subscribe to the GOP beliefs....that we're screwed if we do, and screwed if we don't. Either way you'll discount us as the bad guys.

This isn't a comic book, or a game. Politics determine the future of our country and how we as citizens live. We shouldn't be thinking that way. We should be voting for competent leaders, not throwing people who don't agree with your opinions under the bus.

In reality the only racists I see in debates and politics.....are the individuals who actually make racist remarks. Not entire groups, not entire political bases, and certainly not the opposing view to your own. I rest my case (sorry pet peeve on this one).
 
 
 
I haven't been this excited since Bobby Jindal became the new Fred Thompson.

 

I too loved Fred Thompson. He would have made a great POTUS.

Bobby Jindal is a great man and a rising star in the GOP.

Since when?

His 2009 rebuttal speech to Obama's address to a joint session of Congress was an unmitigated disaster; his political career has been over since then.
 
 
I love it, I just knew that some would accuse Caine of basically being nothing but the Repubican parties token nigger (pardon the word but it fits in this sentence.) It certainly couldn't be that the guy is a serious person who people with brains would do well to listen to regardless of skin color could it? I'm not convinced he'd make a good President, haven't seen enough of him to know yet. But I do know that he makes Obama look like a child.
 
 
 
Probably the smartest man among the current gop field.

 

I remember " conservatives " saying the same thing about Richard Steele.

Yeah......he really got a lot o' support from Republicans.

He's a well trained puppet. Just how the liberal establishment wants him. A good little soldier. They are proud.

 

There's no such thing as a "liberal establishment." You've been trapped by the false left-right paradigm. The global elites at the top control both the Liberal and Conservative leadership. Proof of this fact is the fact that Obama and McCain are part of the same globalist organization, the Bilderberg Group.

Apparently Cain does not have an offical website.

But if  WIKIpedia  is fairly representing his positions, I'd say he's supportive of continued dismantling of the central government in favor of even greater corporate feudalism.

Hardly surprising given his career, I suppose.

 
Economic
Cain believes economic growth can be achieved by implementing policies that emphasize less legislation, less regulation, lower taxes, and business friendly policies.  [34] 
[  edit  ] Taxes

Cain supports lowering the corporate tax rates from 35 to 25 percent, eliminating the capital gains tax, and suspending taxes on repatriated foreign profits.  [35]  He also supports elimination of the estate tax, often pejoratively referred to as the "death tax" by detractors.  [36] 
[  edit  ] Fair Tax

Cain is a strong supporter of the  Fair Tax .  [37]  This would replace all federal personal and corporate income taxes with a national consumption tax of 23%, while remaining revenue neutral.
[  edit  ] Bank bailouts

Cain supported the  Troubled Asset Relief Program  (TARP) bank bailouts as a way to save the economy, viewing it as an investment opportunity for the taxpayers. In a 2008 editorial, Cain wrote, "Owning a part of the major banks in America is not a bad thing. We could make a profit while solving a problem.".  [38]  In May 2011, regarding his TARP support, Cain said "I donÂ’t have any regrets".... "I studied the situation. I didnÂ’t have trouble with the idea; I had trouble with its implementation, picking winners and losers."  [39] 
[  edit  ] Federal Reserve

In early 2011, Cain stated on his radio show that there was no need for an audit of the Federal Reserve (Cain objected to auditing the Federal Reserve in 2010 while hosting the Neil Boortz show).  [40]  Cain has clarified, however, that while such an audit is not a high priority for him, neither does he object to it.
[  edit  ] Gold standard

Cain announced his support of the  gold standard  on a radio program in late 2010:
"Yes I believe in the gold standard. We should have never gotten off the gold standard because when we got off the gold standard, that then allowed Congress to inflate our currency whenever they overspent. Now look at the mess that we have."  [41] 
[  edit  ] Welfare

Sounds like a step in the correct direction
 
 
 
 
 
He's a well trained puppet. Just how the liberal establishment wants him. A good little soldier. They are proud.

 

There's no such thing as a "liberal establishment." You've been trapped by the false left-right paradigm. The global elites at the top control both the Liberal and Conservative leadership. Proof of this fact is the fact that Obama and McCain are part of the same globalist organization, the Bilderberg Group.

 

Mccain is a liberal progressive slob.

 

Please !!!

No Progressive / Liberal would have gone to PHIL GRAMM....

 
.....  for ECONOMIC-consultation  !!!!

Mccain is a liberal progressive slob.

 

McCain, like many of the politicians in power, have no real beliefs. That's why the Liberal and Conservative leadership supports the same policies and are controlled by the same global elites. As Ron Paul rightly said, there's the big government Republicans and the big government Democrats. They're both the same.
 
 
 
3) He appeals to the Tea Party. Yes he does. Isn't that wonderful? That means he isn't a tyrannical social ideologue but is committed to fiscal integrity, lower taxes, and personal freedom.

 

He supports personal freedom? No.

Herman Cain wants to enslave millions of Americans by supporting the Drug War. I haven't heard him say not even once that he'd end the War on Drugs.

Herman Cain supports enslaving us through the Federal Reserve banking system by making us slaves to a valueless currency. Why does he support the Federal Reserve if he supposedly believes in the gold-standard and personal freedom?

Herman Cain also supports the government dictating people's marriage life and discriminates against gays.

Herman Cain supports Israel, a country that bombs innocent civilians in Pakistan.

Doesn't sound like a guy who supports freedom to me.
 
 
 
And to the bolded point above, Obama didn't have experience, so he is a little off on that one.

 

Presidents are decision makers. Everyone knows how to make decisions, no experience necessary.

 
I just like Romney's business sense more than anyone else at this moment in time. I want to see someone that knows how to make good fiscal decisions, which Romney has done. If you look at Wiki, it lists he business career. Pretty much a superstar throughout his life. I probably know less about his politics as opposed to his business history, but I will be taking a look at him. Our economy is in need of being rescued.

I could rally around a Romney/Cain ticket. Both have proven themselves in the real world, not just in the halls of capitol buildings.

 

Yeah, that's a load of bull. Ron Paul would slaughter Romney in a debate on economics. He has studied socio-political philosophy and economics to the highest degree and would probably leave Romney looking like a fool because he has no clue about economics.

Not to mention the fact that Romney doesn't know the last thing about freedom. Perhaps he should pick up Ron Paul's book "Liberty Defined" so he can get a clue.
 
 
 
Apparently Cain does not have an offical website.

But if  WIKIpedia  is fairly representing his positions, I'd say he's supportive of continued dismantling of the central government in favor of even greater corporate feudalism.

Hardly surprising given his career, I suppose.

 
Economic
Cain believes economic growth can be achieved by implementing policies that emphasize less legislation, less regulation, lower taxes, and business friendly policies.  [34] 
[  edit  ] Taxes

Cain supports lowering the corporate tax rates from 35 to 25 percent, eliminating the capital gains tax, and suspending taxes on repatriated foreign profits.  [35]  He also supports elimination of the estate tax, often pejoratively referred to as the "death tax" by detractors.  [36] 
[  edit  ] Fair Tax

Cain is a strong supporter of the  Fair Tax .  [37]  This would replace all federal personal and corporate income taxes with a national consumption tax of 23%, while remaining revenue neutral.
[  edit  ] Bank bailouts

Cain supported the  Troubled Asset Relief Program  (TARP) bank bailouts as a way to save the economy, viewing it as an investment opportunity for the taxpayers. In a 2008 editorial, Cain wrote, "Owning a part of the major banks in America is not a bad thing. We could make a profit while solving a problem.".  [38]  In May 2011, regarding his TARP support, Cain said "I donÂ’t have any regrets".... "I studied the situation. I didnÂ’t have trouble with the idea; I had trouble with its implementation, picking winners and losers."  [39] 
[  edit  ] Federal Reserve

In early 2011, Cain stated on his radio show that there was no need for an audit of the Federal Reserve (Cain objected to auditing the Federal Reserve in 2010 while hosting the Neil Boortz show).  [40]  Cain has clarified, however, that while such an audit is not a high priority for him, neither does he object to it.
[  edit  ] Gold standard

Cain announced his support of the  gold standard  on a radio program in late 2010:
"Yes I believe in the gold standard. We should have never gotten off the gold standard because when we got off the gold standard, that then allowed Congress to inflate our currency whenever they overspent. Now look at the mess that we have."  [41]

Go ahead. The racist shit on the right was few and far between but if you feel the urge deep down inside of you to open up your racist side to the world be my guest.

Maybe we can take racist shit that's being said now by the fringe Obamabot left and apply it to all liberals kinda like you seem to want to do with that fringe right back in 2008 and make all conservatives out to be a bunch of racist supporting Nazis.

Once again, donÂ’t hold back, call Cain all the names you know you really want to.

ItÂ’s fun watching all this because itÂ’s so clear to see that the fringe left is losing their minds over the fact that the right just is not even a 10th as racist as they try feverishly to make them out to be. Like Rtard does every single day.

 

You know the forum keeps a record of past posts, right?  

 

You lost me, so what?

 

Anyone here who in the past tried to mitigate and excuse the 'racially insensitive' attacks on President Obama will look rather silly if they throw a fit over anything similar done towards Cain.
Granted, not that most of these people would care. Most of the rightwingers here are impervious to revelations about their lack of character and hypocrisy.

You can look for the racially insensitive attacks to rev up just as soon as Cain starts building some impressive favoribility in the polls. Hmmm. Wonder which side that is most likely to come from? Cain's side? Or the Obama supporter's side?

And what do you want to bet that those who make race the issue re Cain will be the same people who made race the issue when they supported Obama? And THAT was most of the racial insensitivity that existed.

McCain had 100% conservative voting record in 2010?   I know what study you're referring to and it has been debunked. The group hand-picked 96 votes out of 299 to come to that conclusion. Sorry to rain on your parade. Look at the Poole reports which used all the data. Here are the results of the most conservative member of the 111th Congress:

* Tom Coburn
* Jim DeMint
* John Kyl
* John Barrasso
* Jim Inhofe

John McCain ranked 26th.
 
 
 
Anyway, the lefties say we have been making watermelon jokes about Obama. Who dunnit, and where is a link?

 

You don't understand. I am the world's greatest grand champion watermelon lover. I can't WAIT for them to start arriving at the Farmer's market and it is our primary fruit source all summer long.

So I'm probably sooner or later going to mention watermelon.

And because he is President, sooner or later I will post something about Obama.

And voila!!! Watermelon and President Obama on the same page? Maybe in the same thread? RACIST!!!!

That's why I've said I did not want a BLACK President. I didn't want a President that you have to be constantly conscious of his race, can't treat just like anybody else, can't use certain words or imagery, can't criticize like anybody else.

I certainly didn't mind having a President who happened to be black though.

One of the best things we could do to eliminate racism once and for all is throw the PC crap out the window and start treating all people just like everybody else. As long as we are required to defer to somebody's race and aren't allowed to use the same language we would use for everybody else, race consciousness will continue to be the primary focus and racism will continue.

When I say monkey, I am not referring to the color of anybody's skin.
When I say watermelon, I am not referring to anybody else's diet.
 
 
 
You can look for the racially insensitive attacks to rev up just as soon as Cain starts building some impressive favoribility in the polls.

 

Yeah, Â‘as soon.Â’ WeÂ’ll be waiting for that to happen, alright.

And the right actually believes the voters will elect someone Â‘qualified?Â’ When was the last time that happened? Truman, Eisenhower, perhaps?

Beat him convincingly.
Target him for defeat.
Demolish him in the debates.
Run him over at the polls.
Etc.

But I'm not allowed to say any of that if his skin is black of course. It sometimes looks like they think he isn't good enough to treat like everybody else.

Good thing I am the poster girl for the anti-political correctness police.

Speaking of the Obama and watermelons at the same time is "racially insensitive".

did we ever think we would be seeing that crap folks.?

We all knew when the Obama got elected they would SCREAM RACISM at any criticism of him and BOY did they ever. A lot of it was so stupid (watermelon, basketball, monkeys) that all you could do was laugh.

But, Now that Cain has announced, watch out folks. You will SEE racist come out in full force.

You're missing a key piece of the puzzle. Racially insensitive remarks should not be tolerated, but your ilk have a penchant for seeing racism where none exists. The biggest example is how the word 'racism' is used to refer to anyone who disagrees with the policies of Obama. Unfortunately, the MSM seems to give these people a pass. The sad reality is that it's okay to call anyone who disagrees with a liberal politician's policies as a racist, but not the other way around. If you don't see this, then you're either not paying attention or living in denial. (Wait, weren't you the guy who said McCain was the most conservative member of the Congress in 2010?   It all makes sense now.)

Are you saying that Michelle Obama looks like all black people?

Or are you saying black people look like gorillas?

Why would you think these things?
 
 
 

This was no big deal to the Right around here. Not racist at all.

That was the consensus, with my apologies to the small number of wingnuts here who might have actually objected to this.

So it's safe to assume that the rightwing consensus here will be that similar attacks on Herman Cain won't be considered racist either.
 
 
 
 
 
The fact that you have to ask confirms the validity of the rest of my post, the part you didn't quote.

 

You're missing a key piece of the puzzle. Racially insensitive remarks should not be tolerated, but your ilk have a penchant for seeing racism where none exists. The biggest example is how the word 'racism' is used to refer to anyone who disagrees with the policies of Obama. Unfortunately, the MSM seems to give these people a pass. The sad reality is that it's okay to call anyone who disagrees with a liberal politician's policies as a racist, but not the other way around. If you don't see this, then you're either not paying attention or living in denial. (Wait, weren't you the guy who said McCain was the most conservative member of the Congress in 2010?   It all makes sense now.)

 

John McCain got a 100% rating from the American Conservative Union for his 2010 Senate voting record.
Go refute them if you have a problem.  The American Conservative Union 

 

Uh, no. That was the National JournalÂ‘s 2010 vote ratings and I've already said how bogus the results were. The NJ didn't even say which votes were used in its scoring and which it ignored. The only thing they said was that they used 96 out of 299 votes.

Try again.

There were a few isolated racially sensitive remarks and as I've highlighted for your edification, they should not be tolerated. Most of the charges of racism were nonexistent and were only used as cover for a failed presidency.

You're lying.

From the ACU's website:

How We Pick the VotesÂ…The American Conservative Union was founded in 1964 to promote the principles of liberty and the strength of the Constitution

As the nationÂ’s largest and strongest grassroots conservative organization, the ACU serves as the umbrella organization for conservatives in America.

The American Conservative Union tracks a wide range of issues before Congress to determine which issues and votes serve as a dividing line to help separate those Members of the U.S. House and Senate who protect liberty as conservatives and those who are truly liberal.

As a result, the ACU Ratings of Congress has throughout its 38 Editions included a wide variety of issues covering votes on taxes, wasteful government spending, cultural issues, defense and foreign policy.

It should be noted that for the year 2010, the House and Senate leadership virtually shut down the amendment process through parliamentary maneuvering which prevented either House from holding roll call votes on many social and cultural issues of importance to conservatives.

The votes selected in this edition of the ACU Ratings of Congress are not always considered the Â“most importantÂ” votes as defined by others, instead the votes selected are chosen to create a clear ideological distinction among those casting them.

These ratings have throughout the years become a go-to guide to determine whether an elected officialÂ’s philosophical rhetoric matches his or her record. ACUÂ’s purpose in this guide is to inform the public, in an unbiased way, on where individual members of Congress fall on the ideological spectrum.

Instead of "lying", would it not be more polite to say "misinformed"?

WhatÂ’s amusing about that is liberals Â– like the rest of the nation Â– have no idea who he is, much less his race.
 
 
Herman Cain is a far rightwing Republican who cannot be elected because not enough Americans agree with his far right agenda.

Black, white, or chartreuse he is out of the mainstream of American politics. He cannot win the center in a national election and you have to win the center to win the election.

Of COURSE he appeals to the rightwing crowd, that 20 or 30 percent out there on the right end of the political spectrum.

When there are twice that many of you, maybe then you can get a guy like Cain elected.
 
 
Oh, and don't you rightwingers talk about food-stamps.

Democraps assume you're talking black folks when you talk about food-stamps.

Just like mentioning the word poverty, the poor, or anything that relates to people in the lower income tax bracket.

You're a racist because we know when you say these things you're talking about black folks plain and simple.

HOW DARE YOU!!!!
 
 
I love this thread. You tards are a gift that keeps on giving.
 
 
If you liked the "gift" we gave you on Nov 2, 2010, just wait for the "gift" we give you on election day next year.

It might be polite but then I would be lying. He was not misinformed since I originally referenced the source of my information.

Lying is when you state something you know to be untrue. I think that applies here.

Looks like Cain is already blowing it...

But this morning on Fox News Sunday, Cain showed just how limited his understanding is of the Middle East peace process. Asked by host Chris Wallace what he would be prepared to offer Palestinians as part of a deal, Cain responded, Â“Nothing.Â” Just moments later, Cain was dazed and confused when Wallace referenced the issue of Â“right of returnÂ” of Palestinian refugees:

WALLACE : Where do you stand on the right of return?

CAIN : The right of return? [pause] The right of return?

WALLACE : The Palestinian right of return.

CAIN : ThatÂ’s something that should be negotiated. ThatÂ’s something that should be negotiated.

Wallace then helpfully (There's the good Fox host, trying to tee it up for him) offered Cain a definition of Â“right of returnÂ” Â— Â“Palestinian refugees, the people that were kicked out of the land in 1948, should be able to or should have any right to return to Israeli land.Â” Cain again showed his lack of knowledge, veering completely off his pro-Likud script. Â“I donÂ’t think they have a big problem with people returning,Â”

gop just got their black friend...sad

 

You're the one who just brought up race. What does skin color, ethnicity, have to do with anything?

 

Hillary ran, McCain needed to find a woman (any woman, even one who believed she could see Russia from her porch); Barrack won, the GOP needs a black candidate (any conservative black man will do).

The issue is not race, it's all about tokenism. The GOP is overwhelmingly white in a nation becoming more diverse each year, to win it needs to change the perception that it is intolerant of Americans of color, the GLBT community, and non-Christian creeds.

Good luck, no one will believe painting a tiger with polka dots will fool anyone.

Let's not forget how the GOP reactively leaped on Michael Steele (did I mention he's black) for RNC chair in the wake of Obama's election...

...Michael Steele, who had, as was ignored at the time, a political stand on the left/right spectrum comparable to Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe,

and yet HE was immediately adopted as another conservative darling...

Which is exactly what Netanyahu said:

Let's say we just treat Cain the same way the Right treated Obama, racially speaking. Will you Cain fans accept that as fair? Seeing how you defended the stuff thrown at Obama,

like the watermelon stuff, the gorilla stuff, the witch doctor stuff, etc., etc.

You managed find reasons to excuse all that and give it a pass, so in fairness, you should give anyone on the left or wherever a pass on anything of the sort they throw at Cain.

You wouldn't want to be hypocrites now, would you?

 

Go ahead. The racist shit on the right was few and far between but if you feel the urge deep down inside of you to open up your racist side to the world be my guest.

Maybe we can take racist shit that's being said now by the fringe Obamabot left and apply it to all liberals kinda like you seem to want to do with that fringe right back in 2008 and make all conservatives out to be a bunch of racist supporting Nazis.

Once again, donÂ’t hold back, call Cain all the names you know you really want to.

ItÂ’s fun watching all this because itÂ’s so clear to see that the fringe left is losing their minds over the fact that the right just is not even a 10th as racist as they try feverishly to make them out to be. Like Rtard does every single day.

 

The Left is a 1000 times more racist than the Right. They are the ones always talking about race, they are the ones always assuming if something bad was said it was meant to represent a minority race. In their minds the so closely associate inarticulateness, poverty, crime, rage with other races that they can't help but always hear those comments as racist. All others not like them are subhuman and in their eyes can't help themselves.

Yet the Left lumps together the Tea Party with what one or two racist people (who are probably covert Leftists operatives anyway)? And that isn't ignorant. The Democratic party is one part. It may have had different factions based on geographical locations, but they were all still one party. It is the heritage of today's Democratic party. When will Obama denounce his party's history?

Once again the left leaves things out to make it sound like Cain knows nothing at about Middle East Process. Seawytch dropped 2 things in order to make it sound like Herman Cain does not know anything about the Middle East.
Herman Cain said that the U.S. should do Nothing about it.In other words stay out of it. That it was up to Israel and the Palestinians. Not the U.S.
Then another thing that Seawytch left out was Cain does not think that the Palestinians are interested in peace.
That the issue should be negotiated between the two and those two only.
He said he doesn't think that Israel has a problem with Palestinians returning. But it is up to them.
This is what the left do all the time, leave things out and in this case she is trying to make Herman Cain
sound like he knows nothing about the issue.
This is just the start of it.
What he said is nowhere near what she just tried to report.
Go to her link and listen to it for yourself.
 
 
 
 
 
lol...you are too stupid to even follow what i am talking about. Go back to playing with playdoh cunt

 

Racist Pig.

 

you dont even understand those words.

 

I bet you believe the racist line of shit your spew so much that if you had the chance you would be arrogant enough (or man enough) to say what you really think of Cain's appearance on the Republican stage to his face while on national TV.

AinÂ’t anonymity awesome, you can be a absolute racist bigot low life scum bag and apparently not even realize it.
 
 
 
 
 
I hope he provides a birth certificate......otherwise Trump will be mad at him

 

I bet he has it locked and loaded and ready to show anybody who wants to see it. I bet ALL the candidates, from ALL parties, have their birth certificates ready to go.

 

Since NOW its an issue. Never before but for some reason, now its a thing. Once again, this is the first time something happens under this administration...

Funny huh.

 

I have serious doubts about Cain and I just can't take his word for it. I will assume he was not born here until he proves otherwise

Pretty much the same as yours:

 
 
 
 
If you liked the "gift" we gave you on Nov 2, 2010, just wait for the "gift" we give you on election day next year.

 

Then you have an odd way of thinking what a gift is.
my son is a gift. My health is a gift. Nov 2010 was just another day watching you tards fight it out.mark my words it will flip again and the left will be saying exactly what you just did. Oh wait they did in 08. They said they had a mandate and spoke for the people just like you are...

Newsflash:

nailed it. Cain is a vessel and nothing more. As soon as anyone doesnt adhere to their brand of thinking, they get tossed under the bus. See Powell for that. Cain is going after a very select loud section of voters. The thing is they are not enough to win a national election.

 

Cain has the right common sense answers to the problems we are facing, and the right approach of following the will of the people. He is being himself, and that is what resonates so well with common sense Americans.

And I thought Obama was the one who is the "black puppet" or "black Mascot". At least according to some Leftist Black leaders.

So if you replace like so, you might be onto something:
" Obama is a vessel and nothing more. As soon as anyone doesnt adhere to their brand of thinking, they get tossed under the bus."
 
 
 
How many conservatives want to see Cain's birth certificate?

 

I don't, but I assure you he wouldn't take over 2 years to produce it.
 
 
 
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...........................

Finally a Republican announces to run, instead of announcing not to..

I don't, but I assure you he wouldn't take over 2 years to produce it.

 

Who'd it take that long to produce theirs? If you're reffering to the President.. well, you're wrong. He produced it a long time ago, it just wasn't enough for dumbazz birfers. And now, apparently, the long-form isn't either.. to the after-birfers.  
 
 
 
 
How many conservatives want to see Cain's birth certificate?

 

I don't, but I assure you he wouldn't take over 2 years to produce it.

 

We should be able to find something about it in Cain's autobiographies.....he has written at least two (2) hasn't he?
 
 
 
At this point, gut level, I fear that Romney is going to be the nominee by default as the vote is split among everybody else. That is how McCain got in. And I think the electorate will be just as unenthused about voting for Romney as they were Mc Cain.

At least Herman Cain at this point does not generate those kinds of feelings for me. One of the points he made was that everybody else we've elected lately has had political experience. And how is that working out for us?

Unless something comes up that I don't see now, I wouldn't have to hold my nose to vote for Cain.

 

I met and supported Herman Cain when he ran his unsuccessful race for the Senate. I have given him my support and a few bucks in his hopefully successful run for the Presidency.

Black puppet? Cain isnt a black puppet and neither is Obama. You want to bring up more meaningless points and not actually address the issue that Cain is nothing more than a feel good story. He makes you feel good. He takes the heat off your Obama hate. Now The left cant say the GOP is full of racists. You will just point to Cain.

ah another dumbass. Nothing i said was racist. Not a single word of it.

I already said what i think of cain and his Ideology. I'd say it to your face as well as anyone else. Its an observation, not racism, but you are too stupid or are blatantly pulling this crap.

well when when i start throwing out racist shit, you will be the first to know.
 
 
 
I will ask it again. Do you really think the racist Tea Baggers can vote for a black man?

 

Yeah, why not.

The agenda of the "Tea Party" has nothing to do with race.

You need to watch something besides Bill Maher, Parrot.

It would be interesting to see how blacks would vote given 2 black candidates.

I'm a TEA party supporter I have no problem voting for a black, a Hispanic, an oriental or an Arab, as long as his values are reasonably close to mine. I do have a problem voting for a lying sack of shit socialist, no matter what color his skin.

Why do you insist on calling people tea baggers? Are you homophobic? Or just a faggot?

My apologies to the rational gays and lesbians here.

 

Nope, not a racist bone in your body! This is Archie Bunker, right?

Cain doesnt have common sense answers. He is saying what you already agree with.

 

Exactly "you" the common people, hence common sense. The will of the people: the majority of the people. (Sure, I have some vies that are not majority views, but I don't expect them to be the answers for the country unless the culture changes.)

 
Black puppet? Cain isnt a black puppet and neither is Obama. You want to bring up more meaningless points and not actually address the issue that Cain is nothing more than a feel good story.

Of course, Cain is a "feel good story". It feels good getting this country back, he offers real hope and real change. He does make me feel good. I don't hate Obama, I think he never got a chance to develop leadership skills because the Left had to be racist and only see the color of his skin. They couldn't evaluate him.

The Left could never say the GOP is full of racist and be accurate. They still say it anyway and will always. Being a racer is too addictive, and it will be (already is) the downfall of many people on the Left. It's a shame they have to bring down minorities with them.

The collapse of the economy as Obama took office drove the NYSE from 14,000 to just over 6,000. It has gained back 6,500 pts. I call that an amazing recovery in that a lot of the 14,000 pts was bubble. Denying this fact is willful ignorance. The value of the NYSE has nearly doubled in two years in the rebound of the worst financial shock this country has ever seen....you don't think that is astounding? I do. The truth is..that the recovery of the NYSE has been historic...unprecedented..

Sorry I can't joint your pack of nitwit hyenas...

 Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) History 

 

Astounding? Well, all the nitwit hyenas (aka credible economists) I've been reading are pretty well agreed on a couple of things I think you might not be considering.

Here's one point of view that is pretty well agreed among all:

 
Unprecedented monetary and fiscal policies have created an economic recovery that is artificial to an indeterminate degree. Similarly, the massive rally in the stock market of the past two years has been built to an uncomfortably large extent on the shaky ground of extraordinary government intervention in the form of $1.5 trillion annual fiscal deficits and over $2 trillion of Federal Reserve asset purchase programs. Aside from job creation, which has been consistently disappointing, U.S. economic data have generally surprised on the upside over the past several months, but how the economy performs once stimulus begins to be withdrawn after the second quarter is an open question.
 Geopolitical Upheaval, End of QE2 Increase Stock Market Correction Risk - Seeking Alpha 

 

The daily numbers don't ever tell the whole story. With interest rates at effectively zero, and real estate losing ground every month, the market is the only place investors have to go. Much of the boom is driven by high oil prices and as those have slowly been coming down, the market has been following. We'll know soon enough how much of the 'rally' has been on oil speculators.

In short, any Obama policies that have affected the market have been largely artificial and short term.

 

Hardly.

The stimulus and the bailout saved the country from another Great Depression. When an economy is in a deflationary spiral, the government has to be the demand of last resort. Congress and the President realized this and did the right thing.

Likewise, the rescue of GM turned it into a profitable company again.

Obama has done a very good job, and Bush did not.

It helps to have a smart president, my friends.

 

Bush gave the TARP bailout to Obama so it is obvious that you consider Bush a smart President.

Obama got almost a trillion dollar stimulus fund, promising that unemployment would be below 8%. How is that working out for you?
 
 
 
Obama got almost a trillion dollar stimulus fund, promising that unemployment would be below 8%. How is that working out for you?

 

The stimulus fund went to Democrat pet projects, not to industries with higher unemployment. I mean, what's the unemployment rate of green energy researchers? They could probably get another job from someone with less education. It's just a bad policy in the hands of bad policy makers.
 
 
 
Exactly "you" the common people, hence common sense. The will of the people: the majority of the people. (Sure, I have some vies that are not majority views, but I don't expect them to be the answers for the country unless the culture changes.)

 

ah its the will of the people right up until you disagree, and then its tyranny. Yeah not buying this.

 
Of course, Cain is a "feel good story". It feels good getting this country back, he offers real hope and real change. He does make me feel good. I don't hate Obama, I think he never got a chance to develop leadership skills because the Left had to be racist and only see the color of his skin. They couldn't evaluate him.

 

Lol, he offers catered Ideals that you and your kind will eat up everyday. That people like Palin and Trump capitalize on and make loads of money off of. Which i consider them very smart for taking advantage of suckers.

If you think that of Obama and the left, then you are a 100% moron.

 
The Left could never say the GOP is full of racist and be accurate. They still say it anyway and will always. Being a racer is too addictive, and it will be (already is) the downfall of many people on the Left. It's a shame they have to bring down minorities with them.

 

And the right can never say the left are racists and it be accurate. The right ( as we have gone over this before) has demonstrated over and over again they have racists among their party. rare these days you ever see a Lefty being a racist. The only thing that comes close is this idea that the right started using to claim reverse racism. You are the kid that broke the glass with a rock, and blame the landlord for goading him.

But then again i see you are trying your hardest to channel ( talk radio style debating that has taken over as of late).

You have no actual proof. You have talking points that have been hand fed to you, and you eat it up like candy.

What a load of babbling blithering bullshit.

When you can substantiate that any politico, "The right has demonstrated over and over again they have racists among their party" (BTW, "THE RIGHT" is not a party, moron) has been as racist as George McGovern or Robert Byrd during the past three decades, then you may be relevant...

until then

...You'd do much better stretching your obviously limited intellectual ability dropping the c-bomb on female members.
 
 
Herman Cain is a shill.
 
 
the Devil is in the details. How so?

 
 
 
 
Hermin Cain Announces!!!!!!!!!

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...........................

Your thoughts?

 

Is it a new topping or a new crust?

The suspense is killing me!!!!!
 
 
All I care is that he tops Obama.
 
 
 
What does race have to do with it?

 

Tina Turner - 1984!

I love that song!

 
 
 
 
 
 
That's some smart thinking, Tex. I guess you listened closely to Obama's agenda prior to your vote.

Brilliant.

 

Whatever PeggySue... Palin was not and is not qualified to be the leader of the free world. Period.

 

But Obama was?

Big boy thinking cap. You can do it.

 

He is the leader of the free world, so...yeah!
 
 
 
Ran his own Business,Conservative beliefs? Sounds pretty good to me. Probably exactly what this country needs right now. I'll have to study up on him some more though.

 

I know a guy in town that runs a successful septic tank business, and he's a conservative.

I guess you would vote for him, too!

 
I'm ok with voting for a successful Businessman with Conservative beliefs. Cain has real life-experience in running Businesses,unlike most who are running the country right now. If he wins the GOP Nomination,i'll vote for him.

 

Yeah, you said that already.

How many more times?
 
 
 
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...........................

Your thoughts?

 

Is America ready to elect an American black president ?
 
 
 
Herman Cain is a real American conservative capitalist. Don't you all know that means he's a racist. Uh, ah, wait a minute..........hold on.......Um......never mind.

 

Donald Trump is a real American conservative who's gonna kick Obama's... he what ?!?

Haley Barbour is a real American conservative who's gonna kick Obama's... him too ?!?

Mike Huckabee is a real American conservative who's gonna kick Obama's... oh, fer fuck's sake!!!

Mitch Daniels is a real American conservative who's gonna kick Obama's... really? His wife ?!?

a septic tank business sounds like perfect training for washington whats this fellows name ? Is he running ?
 
 
 
 
 
Paul/Cain 2012! or Cain/Paul 2012! Either ticket is fine with me.

I'm done with the Republican Party. If they nominate Romney or Perry I'm just gonna' write in someone else.
Why? He endorsed Obama.

 

So what?

I'm a republican and I voted for Obama. It's not my fault the idiot powers that be in the GOP put a nitwit on the ticket a heatbeat from the white house. I had no other choice. I saw Palin as a clear and present danger and was not going to do anything to improve her chances.

The president is a leader. He doesn't create legislation...he can't really do anything about many things people believe he is responsible for. I am not naive like that. What the president DOES do is from time to time act on his own judgment with the military. I would trust Powell to make the right calls.

 

You saw Sara Palin as a nitwit so you voted for a ticket that included Joe Biden. Why, exactly do you consider Palin a nitwit?

 

Holy shit!  
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, but in his defense, Hannity is the one that dropped Rubio and Ryan. He just said that they aren't even in the running.

I like what I know of Ryan to a large degree, but he isn't running, so I'm not paying too much attention to him right now beyond his budget proposal.

I actually like Bachmann. I think she risks getting skewered more than Palin, however, so in my opinion, she has no chance.

Probably surprising to some is that I like Romney. I think he has a strong business background, and his attempt at addressing health insurance/care in his state doesn't offend my sensibilities. The state level is where those issues SHOULD be addressed, not at the federal level.

I personally wouldn't put Cain at the top of the ticket. I think he would do better to serve as VP and go from there, imo.

 

I agree, but not that Mitt has any chance at on the President level.

 

I might be misunderstanding your post. You think that Romney can't win the nomination? He seems like he is starting to get his campaign going right now in a pretty remarkable manner.

 

America doesn't vote for cultists as president.
 
 
 
 
Probably the smartest man among the current gop field.

 

Newt is the smartest.

Just check out his education.

I think he's the only candidate with a PHD.

 

When it came to Obama, the wingnuts said that education didn't matter.

You're all in panic mode! It's fucking hilarious to watch.

So let me get this straight. Republicans are racists for opposing Obama but are supporting Cain because he's a token black guy. Did I get that right?

 

No.

We hate Cain because we hate strong conservative women.

 

Cain is a man.

Glad to see you can admit you hate him.

Guess he's left the plantation.....so to you he's just an uppity nigger.

 

 
 
 
 
I'd love to see a Cain/Rubio ticket with a commitment to make Alan West Secretary of State. That mofo do know how to negotiate.

 

What is Rubio's record, that he deserves a VP slot? Because he's Hispanic?

Damn - you guys are overcompensating yourself into a tizzy!

Plus, Rubio has no executive experience, which is a requirement of Republicans.

Or is that just for Democrats?
 
 
 
 
 
gop just got their black friend...sad

 

You're the one who just brought up race. What does skin color, ethnicity, have to do with anything?

 

Hillary ran, McCain needed to find a woman (any woman, even one who believed she could see Russia from her porch); Barrack won, the GOP needs a black candidate (any conservative black man will do).

The issue is not race, it's all about tokenism. The GOP is overwhelmingly white in a nation becoming more diverse each year, to win it needs to change the perception that it is intolerant of Americans of color, the GLBT community, and non-Christian creeds.

Good luck, no one will believe painting a tiger with polka dots will fool anyone.

 

This is why they have a hard-on for Rubio.
 
 
 
 
Looks like Cain is already blowing it...

But this morning on Fox News Sunday, Cain showed just how limited his understanding is of the Middle East peace process. Asked by host Chris Wallace what he would be prepared to offer Palestinians as part of a deal, Cain responded, Â“Nothing.Â” Just moments later, Cain was dazed and confused when Wallace referenced the issue of Â“right of returnÂ” of Palestinian refugees:

WALLACE : Where do you stand on the right of return?

CAIN : The right of return? [pause] The right of return?

WALLACE : The Palestinian right of return.

CAIN : ThatÂ’s something that should be negotiated. ThatÂ’s something that should be negotiated.

Wallace then helpfully (There's the good Fox host, trying to tee it up for him) offered Cain a definition of Â“right of returnÂ” Â— Â“Palestinian refugees, the people that were kicked out of the land in 1948, should be able to or should have any right to return to Israeli land.Â” Cain again showed his lack of knowledge, veering completely off his pro-Likud script. Â“I donÂ’t think they have a big problem with people returning,Â”

 GOP Contender Herman Cain Demonstrates Clueslessness On Middle East Policy, Confused By Â‘Right Of ReturnÂ’ 

 

Right of return is a joke. It's like reparations....not gonna happen.

Wallace then helpfully (there's the good fox host, trying to tee it up for him) offered cain a definition of Â“right of returnÂ” Â— Â“palestinian refugees, the people that were kicked out of the land in 1948, should be able to or should have any right to return to israeli land.Â” cain again showed his lack of knowledge, veering completely off his pro-likud script. Â“i donÂ’t think they have a big problem with people returning,Â”

 gop contender herman cain demonstrates clueslessness on middle east policy, confused by Â‘right of returnÂ’ 

 

right of return is a joke. It's like reparations....not gonna happen.

 

cain is a joke. It's like palin...not gonna happen.

Astounding? Well, all the nitwit hyenas (aka credible economists) I've been reading are pretty well agreed on a couple of things I think you might not be considering.

Here's one point of view that is pretty well agreed among all:

The daily numbers don't ever tell the whole story. With interest rates at effectively zero, and real estate losing ground every month, the market is the only place investors have to go. Much of the boom is driven by high oil prices and as those have slowly been coming down, the market has been following. We'll know soon enough how much of the 'rally' has been on oil speculators.

In short, any Obama policies that have affected the market have been largely artificial and short term.

 

Hardly.

The stimulus and the bailout saved the country from another Great Depression. When an economy is in a deflationary spiral, the government has to be the demand of last resort. Congress and the President realized this and did the right thing.

Likewise, the rescue of GM turned it into a profitable company again.

Obama has done a very good job, and Bush did not.

It helps to have a smart president, my friends.

 

Bush gave the TARP bailout to Obama so it is obvious that you consider Bush a smart President.

Obama got almost a trillion dollar stimulus fund, promising that unemployment would be below 8%. How is that working out for you?

 

That's now a classic rightwing myth. You need to turn off your radio.
 
 
 
 
 
Probably the smartest man among the current gop field.

 

Newt is the smartest.

Just check out his education.

I think he's the only candidate with a PHD.

 

When it came to Obama, the wingnuts said that education didn't matter.

You're all in panic mode! It's fucking hilarious to watch.

 

mudwhistle is citing Newt's degree? Would that be the same mudwhistle who said this?

I don't see what college has to do with success.

Well, by golly, yes it is!!

 What does Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, & Rush Limbaugh have in common? 

USMB's phoniest dumbest fuck comes through again!!!

 Stimulating Hypocrisy: 114 Lawmakers Block Recovery While Taking Credit For Its Success 

  House Of Representatives

House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) Said Stimulus Funds Would Create Â“Much Needed Jobs.Â” Minority Leader Boehner: Â“The stated intent of the so-called stimulus package was to create jobs, and certainly a $57 million slush-fund studying projects did nothing to achieve that goal. With OhioÂ’s unemployment rate the highest itÂ’s been in 25 years, IÂ’m pleased that federal officials stepped in to order Ohio to use all of its construction dollars for shovel-ready projects that will create much-needed jobs.Â” [Boehner Statement,  6/15/09  ] -Congressman Boehner Voted Against The Recovery Package Twice [Roll Call Vote  #46  ; Roll Call Vote  #70  ]
-Congressman Boehner Regularly Blasts The Stimulus And Instructed His Caucus To Oppose It. [Huffington Post,  1/27/09  ]
Minority Whip Eric Cantor (R-VA) Held A Job Fair Where Nearly Half The 30 Organizations Received Stimulus Funds; Cantor Also Supported Using Stimulus Funds To Build A Washington To Richmond Rail. Washington Post: Â“For months, Democrats have dubbed U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia a hypocrite for strongly opposing the federal stimulus package only to promote aspects of it later. HereÂ’s the latest example: Nearly half of the 30 organizations participating in a job fair  Cantor is holding Monday in Culpeper  were recipients of the stimulusÂ…In the summer,  Cantor came under fire  after he talked about his support of using stimulus money to build a rail project from Washington to Richmond.Â” [Washington Post Virginia Blog,  11/18/09  ] - Congressman Eric Cantor Voted Against The Recovery Package Twice [Roll Call Vote  #46  ; Roll Call Vote  #70  ]
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) Took Credit For $35 Million In Stimulus Highway Funds. According to ThinkProgress, McMorris Rodgers released a statement taking credit for $35 million dollars in stimulus highway money. The House GOP website featured the McMorris Rodgers release on the one year anniversary of the stimulus. [TP,  2/18/10  ] - Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers Voted Against The Recovery Package Twice [Roll Call Vote  #46  ; Roll Call Vote  #70  ]
Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA) Issued Pres Releases Bragging About Bringing Stimulus Jobs To His District. On July 28th, KingstonÂ’s press office fired off two releases bragging about a $106,901 grant for the Alma Police Department and a $138,286 grant for the Jesup Police Department in Georgia. These grants, distributed by the Department of Justice for the Â“hiring of new police officers, to combat violence against women, and to fight Internet crimes against children,Â” were fully-funded by President ObamaÂ’s Recovery Act. [Think Progress,  8/4/09  ] - Congressman Kingston Voted Against The Recovery Package Twice [Roll Call Vote  #46  ; Roll Call Vote  #70  ]
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) Claimed Credit For Stimulus Grants In His District. According to the Ventura County Star, Â“another $8 million in federal money could be flowing into Ventura County through the new federal stimulus package and a separate spending bill that cleared the House this week. Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Simi Valley, announced Thursday that Thousand Oaks will get $182,881 in community development block grants through the stimulus package and that Camarillo will receive $96,075.Â” [Ventura County Star,  2/27/09  ] - Congressman Gallegly Voted Against The Recovery Package Twice [Roll Call Vote  #46  ; Roll Call Vote  #70  ]
Rep. Steve King (R-IA) Claimed Credit For Highway Stimulus Funds He Voted Against. The Iowa blog Bleeding Heartland reported: Â“KingÂ’s office issued an upbeat statement about $570,000 included in the economic stimulus bill that will go toward widening U.S. Highway 20 in a rural area of northwest Iowa. Of course, the statement did not mention that King voted against the stimulus. Nor did the brief news item in the Sioux City Journal.Â” [Bleeding Heartland,  3/14/09  ] - Congressman King Voted Against The Recovery Package Twice [Roll Call Vote  #46  ; Roll Call Vote  #70  ]

Ran his own Business,Conservative beliefs? Sounds pretty good to me. Probably exactly what this country needs right now. I'll have to study up on him some more though.

 

 
I'm ok with voting for a successful Businessman with Conservative beliefs. Cain has real life-experience in running Businesses,unlike most who are running the country right now. If he wins the GOP Nomination,i'll vote for him.

 

You're obviously only good for one thought per thread.

Yup. He's taken credit for every new job created, but except for the government jobs he didn't have much to do with most of them. And if he didn't create jobs, he falls back on the millions and millions of jobs he saved!!! If you got a job during all that, you need to write him a thank you note. If you didn't lose your job during all that, you also need to write him a thank you note.  

And he absolutely sold the stimulus package on the promise that it would keep unemployment from going higher. And when it didn't, he blamed Bush.  

Oh well. All this too shall pass.

I'm pretty sure that a President Cain won't be blaming Bush or Obama but will be focused on what we have to do to get out of the current mess and move forward. Whether he is up to the job, I don't know, but I'm pretty sure he could not possibly do any worse.
 
 
Yes, and don't forget that the new Health Care Bill was supposed to reduce monthly premiums and that you would be able to keep what you had.
 
 
 
Probably the smartest man among the current gop field.

 

.....And (lemme guess)....he can see Russia, from his backyard.... TOO.....right ????

Personally, I think anybody who sees people who happen to be black as somehow significantly different from people who happen to be white and who sees those who don't agree with that as 'selling out to white people' should really go find a country where they can insist that everybody be 'black'.

Herman Cain sees himself as a human being first and his 'blackness' as a physical characteristic, not a character issue. I think most conservative and/or other thinking blacks also see themselves as human beings first and their skin color as a physical characteristic much as the Irish might see their red hair and freckles as a physical characteristic.

That's the way it should be. And until most of us see it that way instead of separating people into groups, racism will remain alive and well in this country. And it will be those who demand that blacks see themselves and act like BLACKS who will be perpetuating it.
