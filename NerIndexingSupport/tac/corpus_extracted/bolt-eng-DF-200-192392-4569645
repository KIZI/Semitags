I really don't like these topics. In the poll you mixed broad terms associated with skin colour and terms expressing geographical areas together - then labelling this a topic (ambiguously/confusingly) about "race".

You should have just stuck to terms like "sub-saharan african, north african, south asian, european origin, east asian" etc. TC did this only to an extent.

Terms related to skin colour as silly since we get variations everywhere and the lines are blurry. For instance, I consider West Asians to be white, arabs think themselves white, and there are still people in the west who think southern europeans like Italians and Greeks arn't white. Indeed, many bushmen don't consider themselves "black" although others might. We find these examples everywhere.

I came in here just to say the same thing. Once on the internets I came across a similar threads directed mainly to Americans and it consisted off..

White
Black
Asian
Spanish

after asking why the Spaniards got a seperate category (obs for any spanish speaking person, whether it be a domincan, cuban, mexican etc),, and then 2 skin colours and a continent. i vowed to end these threads once and for all. were in 2011 and people STILL categorize skin colour and geographical region together in "What race ru"

Where does being White stop? somewhere in the south-eastern uralic countires?

I dont think im tough as said in the art of war presenting yourself as tough is really a weakness. Im not a nationalist im just a person who defends white people when not many other people care about if we get discriminated against. In South Africa people forced the end of apartheid now the whites are the victims of murders by blacks there and guess what no-one cares I dont see any coverage of it on the news. Then you have things like affirmative action against whites in America and Black empowerment against whites in SA and guess what again no-one cares about the whites being putting second with blacks first. Also why should I be one of the majority who would not mind if white nations became white minority?

Sami people from Scandinavia.. white.. asian.. mixed  

not many people know about them in Europe.

my point is though, drawing a line under who is white etc is just dumb imo. its a concept that started for anglo-saxons, no irish, polish or italian, and they all happen to be catholic. i just hate threads like this tbh.

Something like this.......
 
 
 
Yes white nations are becoming white minority I think England is down to 85-87% white now when it was 99% white 50-55 years ago. If no race is superior to another why do non whites move to whites nations and not the other way round is this because we have modified our nations into the best in the world or something else? Yes I justify the holocaust because the jews in Germany viewed many Germans as inferior and many of the communist leaders who wanted to split Germany into smaller communist states were jewish. Also if the holocaust did not take place with the economy in the way it was so many Germans wouldve starved to death like they did post war I think it was 500000.

 

Immigration has nothing to do with race and let's be honest Britain wouldn't have ever been as great as it was/is if it hadn't raided and plundered half the world of its resource just to make itself mighty? Same goes for France, Belgium et.c But unlike you the vast majority don't live in the past and we accept that as a society we made mistakes and have worked hard and continue to do so to rectify those mistakes.

Besides we're all the same race; the human race and we all descended from the African man so like it or not we're all the same.

And the fact you justify the Holocaust and killing of innocent people including women and children just shows what a sick and twisted human being you really are.

Justifying the murder of one human being is bad enough. You're sick you really are. I sure hope you never become a working professional.

my point was that you cant draw a line on what country is white and what isn't. when there are indigenous people in europe who dont look "white". the concept of who is white changes all the time and colour shouldnt be a category for who you are.

this came after i saw a "white black spanish asia".. as the category for americans before. its just dumb tbh.

There are millions of Turks who have Armenian Blood, but it doesn't work the other way round. The Armenians living in Turkey who acknowledge that they are Armenian are 100% Armenian with maybe a couple of exclusions, whereas there are hundreds and thousands of people living in Turkey who think they are Turkish, but actually have Armenian blood within them!

Armenia is an Aryan country dumbass! Armenians have never mixed with other races and that is why they have managed to keep their culture, language and religion through so many centuries. Although there has been a Genocide committed on Armenians and many Empires have tried to conquer their lands, nevertheless they have managed to keep their identity. So don't give all this bull**** talk! Just for a fact, Turkey is a Mongol country. back in the time of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian Empire, modern day Turkey was under Armenian control and all those lands were Armenian (as they are still today Historically Armenian), therefore after the Mongol Empire expanded many people remained in these lands and have lived there ever since and the reason why many Turks look European is due to the fact that a lot of them mixed with Armenians and Assyrians!

dosvidaniya: Well, I consider myself white, because I am not very tanned, whereas my dad is a lot darker than me, but in general - Armenians do consider themselves as white

aryan country?

that has next to no significance anymore. Pakistan is an aryan country so is iran. And to say Armenians have never mixed is delusional when I just posted 3 pics of armenians and all 3 look different.

look at the geographical positioning of Armenia

surrounding countries Iran and Turkey.

due to this, there has been a mixture between the armenians and turks/kurds/iranians. lol at saying armenians haven't mixed.

In history for example the ottoman empire from turkey (when it was an asian nation invaded) Armenia.

here are some more armenians
NOT all armenians are white. That's like saying turks are white as well.

 

just like nearly every country in the world you are not pure.Semitic, Turkic, and Mongoloid elements are present in Armenia. If Armenians are completely white and pure why do so many resemble turks and iranians? If you're armenian there is a good chance you have either russian or turkish ancestory due to geographical positioning.

I don't see how you can argue that?

that has next to no significance anymore. Pakistan is an aryan country so is iran. And to say Armenians have never mixed is delusional when I just posted 3 pics of armenians and all 3 look different.

look at the geographical positioning of Armenia

surrounding countries Iran and Turkey.

due to this, there has been a mixture between the armenians and turks/kurds/iranians. lol at saying armenians haven't mixed.

In history for example the ottoman empire from turkey (when it was an asian nation invaded) Armenia.

here are some more armenians
NOT all armenians are white. That's like saying turks are white as well.

 

just like nearly every country in the world you are not pure.Semitic, Turkic, and Mongoloid elements are present in Armenia. If Armenians are completely white and pure why do so many resemble turks and iranians? If you're armenian there is a good chance you have either russian or turkish ancestory due to geographical positioning.

I don't see how you can argue that?

 

WTF are you on about? Everything you just said is utter bull****. Being white has nothing to do with being mixed. Armenia is country in a hot climate. Temperatures in the summer reaches up to 50 degrees celsius, therefore it is expected for certain people to be much darker than someone else. Geographic position has no relevance in this issue. If you indeed look at geographical position, then you would be able to say that Armenia's surrounding countries are majority Muslim, with great Islamic following and former Empires, with Islam as state religion. Well in that case, questions arise to why Armenians are Christian and strong followers of this faith, because if you are talking about the mixing of Armenians and surrounding people's then clearly 99.5% of the population would not be Christian and there would be at least a large Islamic minority. What you are saying is absolute rubbish and I do not know whether you are a Turk trying to conjure up some new crap, as you have always done or you are just an idiot who claims to know things. Furthermore, the reason why many Turks look like Armenians, is because they have Armenian blood in them. this should not be confused with Armenians in modern day Armenia, because they are Armenian, whereas Turks in Turkey, who are known and consider themselves as Turkish are likely to have Armenian ancestry, because as I had explained earlier, following Genghis Khan's expeditions and advances towards Anatolia, many people settled here and have lived there every since, hence the reason why many Turks look a lot like East Asians. In the case of Iranians, they have lived South of Armenia for many centuries and climate in Armenia and Iran has great similarities, therefore they look similar. This has got nothing to do with mixing, but it is about evolution. In addition, I just want to say that you are clearly uneducated. The Ottoman Empire is not an Asian country. At it's height, the Ottomans governed Northern Africa and the Balkans - situated in Eastern Europe, so just because of that, I can make a judgement on your intelligence. Lastly, I want to tell you that I have studied Armenian History and this includes all aspects of it for a long time. My knowledge on this matter ranges from the time of the Armenian Kingdom of Urartu to the current day Republic of Armenia.

ok, but I do not see why you think that Armenia is exempt from racial mixing. Every single country has mixed down the line. Places like Spain have strong arabic/moor connections and Portugal has some negro admixture due to the slave trade.

Look. Mixing would have taken some place some time down the line in Armenian History, but that was a long time ago and with the rich History of Armenia - it will have been upon the time when nations began forming. Upon the formation of the Armenian Christian State, there has been no mixing in terms of on a large scale. That is the point I am trying to get across, therefore in response to your earlier post - I can not be 'Turkish Armenian', but I am just Armenian. That's all.

Armenia is an Aryan country dumbass! Armenians have never mixed with other races and that is why they have managed to keep their culture, language and religion through so many centuries. Although there has been a Genocide committed on Armenians and many Empires have tried to conquer their lands, nevertheless they have managed to keep their identity. So don't give all this bull**** talk! Just for a fact, Turkey is a Mongol country. back in the time of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian Empire, modern day Turkey was under Armenian control and all those lands were Armenian (as they are still today Historically Armenian), therefore after the Mongol Empire expanded many people remained in these lands and have lived there ever since and the reason why many Turks look European is due to the fact that a lot of them mixed with Armenians and Assyrians!

dosvidaniya: Well, I consider myself white, because I am not very tanned, whereas my dad is a lot darker than me, but in general - Armenians do consider themselves as white  

 

Armenians are not white  
 
 
 
Armenians are not white  

 

Armenians are white! The white race itself has different sub-colours ie different shades eg Scandinavian, Greek etc.
