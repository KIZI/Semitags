The Federation of Internation Football Association (FIFA) has allocated a total
of 290 tickets for Tanzania as it was the case for all other non World Cup
participating member countries, it was learned on Monday.

Arrangements were ready for Tanzanian fans to purchase their tickets because
FIFA has already sent the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) the invoice for the
payments, and fans, who successfully applied for the tickets should pay for them
within three days from Sunday, according to TFF General Secretary Fredrick
Mwakalebela.

The TFF boss said that 250 tickets are for group matches, round of 16,
quarterfinal matches, and playoff, while the other 40 tickets are for opening
match, the two semi-final matches and the final match.

Mwakalebela added that the demand for tickets exceeded supply as over 700 people
had applied for the tickets with only 290 allocated, leaving many soccer fans
unable to get tickets with most applications aimed for the semi-finals and final
match tickets.

The TFF had tried to persuade FIFA to allocate more tickets for Tanzanian fans
and would be informed about the request, whether successful or not, in the near
future, according to the TFF boss.

Tanzania fans will pay maximum charges (900 US dollars) to watch the final match
as FIFA brought in the East African country first class tickets only, while fans
elsewhere can pay as low as 400 dollars, which is lowest price for the final.

Sixty-four soccer matches will be played in 10 stadiums and nine host cities
throughout South Africa including Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg,
Nelspruit, Polokwane, Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, and Rustenburg.
