The Denver Nuggets and coach George Karl have agreed to a new contract that runs
through the 2010-11 NBA season, the team said Friday.

Karl has guided the Nuggets to a 35-18 record this season and will be coaching
the Western Conference All-Star team on Sunday in Dallas.

Karl has the second-most wins in Nuggets' history with 260 and has taken the
team to the playoffs in each of the last five seasons.

Denver fell to the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western
Conference finals last season.

"I think he deserves it," Nuggets star Carmelo Anthony said. "I think he earned
it."

Karl joined the Nuggets in January 2005.
