Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Wednesday condemned the new immigration law
in Arizona as "discrimination."

Calderon made the remarks during a welcoming ceremony hosted by U.S. President
Barack Obama at the White House.

Calderon said that Mexicans living in the U.S. state of Arizona were facing
"discrimination" after the controversial state immigration law was approved.

Calderon, during his visit to the U.S., was expected to hold talks with Obama on
issues ranging from immigration, the fight against drug trafficking, and the
economy.
