 
 
Are churches allowed to be open in Muslim Countries?
 
 
I heard from someone (might be wrong) that Christians aren't allowed to make churches in Muslim countries (Pakistan, etc)

Is this true?
 
 
No it's not true.
 
 
there are plenty of churches in Muslim countries. So, to answer your question, no, it's not true.
 
 
its only holy cities such as mecca where other faiths cannot have houses of worship, or indeed enter
 
 
No its not true

The only place they aren't allowed as far as I am aware in Islam is Mecca and Medina

Any country that bans them cant be an Islamic country
 
 
During the days of the Caliphate (when the muslim world was ruled by Shariah Law) muslim countries were big on relegious tolerance and freedoms, many churches, synagogues and other places of worship were free to open. Non-muslims were entitled to worship what they wanted freely.
 
 
They are allowed to enter its just Saudi Arabia being *****
 
 
There are a million Christians in Pakistan and churches in the major cities.
 
 
yes they are saw a few churches in pakistan one in murri area.. there are quite a few christians living there.. they show them on the news when its christmas/easter time.

Unfortunately Christians are persecuted in some countries.

However, they face a lot of persecution. There is limited respect for freedom of religion in countries where Muslims are a majority.

Yes, it's true in Saudi Arabia.
 
 
I live in a Muslim country and we have churches but they aren't like huge cathedrals or anything. Although I think that's probably more to do with the cost of building one in an extremely expensive city than anything else.
It would go totally against Islam to obstruct anyone from being able to build a house of worship or to worship their own religion because one of the main principles of the religion is tolerance

In many Muslim countries its easier to open a church there than it is to open a Mosque here.

Please elaborate.
 
 
They are but they often face persecution.
 
 
they are but they are often persecuted and so are given minority status
(e.g. in pakistan there are quotas for a certain no of christians to be on the national assembly to get their voice heard as they are often discriminated against and don't really have a public voice apart from that)
 
 
Only forbidden within the Arabian peninsula.
 
 
Here is the crux of the matter.It shows how un-islamic many 'islamic' countries are because it is quite obvious that at its heart it is a tolerant religion,with specific duties to protect christians and jews.However, it is quite obvious that it is that in many islamic countries,other religions are just not tolerated,or suffer deep persecution.The Bahai faith has just been banned in Iran.The Coptic christians are in big trouble in egypt.It goes to show that the prevalent islamic mood in the world is essentially un-islamic, in its intolerance.
The rise of so called islamophobia in the west is directly related to this demand for tolerance on the one hand, and the failure to give it on the other hand.Read some stuff by Andrew Gilligan on what is going on at the East London mosque,and be afraid,very afraid.My biggest fear of course is for those moderate muslims in east london who are suffering most from the misrepresentation of their religion. A doctor i knew who was a humble man,reresenting all that is best about islam,lost his government job in a muslim country when the authorities there discovered his wife was a catholic.

You're not permitted to construct or open churches in Saudi Arabia. And its a very Islamic country.
I also believe Christian and Jewish symbols of worship (such as the Cross and Star of David) are prohibited as well.

It is not permissible allow the kuffaar to take up residence in the Arabian Peninsula. The scholars differed at to the definition of the boundaries of the Arabian Peninsula, but they did not differ as to the fact that Madeenah is part of it.

Ibn Qudaamah said:

It is not permissible for any of them (the kuffaar) to live in the Hijaaz. This is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, but Maalik said: I think that they should be expelled from all the Arab lands, because the Messenger of Allaah (saw) said: “Two religions cannot coexist in the Arabian Peninsula.” Abu Dawood narrated with his isnaad from ‘Umar that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (saw) say: “I will certainly expel the Jews and the Christians from the Arabian Peninsula,, and I will not leave anyone there but Muslims.” Al-Tirmidhi said: this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. And it was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (saw) left behind three instructions. He said: Expel the mushrikeen from the Arabian Peninsula, honour the delegations the way that I do, and he kept quiet about the third. Narrated by Abu Dawood.

 http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/47736/ 

Difference of opinion on the meaning of Arabian Peninsula but that land should be free of non-Muslim residents as 'no two religions can co-exist'.
 
 
I think you have been told the answer, I just wanted to write somthing on this thread.

ok, regardless, the constituent states of the Arabian Peninsula are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and Saudi Arabia and churches are in operation in the majority of these states.

Yes but the banning of churchs and temples only applies to Saudi Arabia. The Jews and Christians that once lived there were given homes in other Muslim lands such as Syria.
 
 
There's a Cathederal in Bahrain, along with a smaller anglican church, a Roman Catholic church and an Evengelical church, plus tens of other small congregations who don't have purpose built churches.
 
 
There are churches in many countries with a Muslim majority population. In fact I've been to a church in every one I've visited.
 
 
I know that in some muslim countries churches are not allowed to do anything that might be seen as trying to convert muslims.
 
 
or use the name Allah - even the churches used it before mohammed was even born.
 
 
There were tonnes of churches in Syria when I went, but muslims constitue 87% of the population with 10% being christians, so that is quite significant.
 
 
Far right propaganda. Plus if it were true it's no argument against the building of mosques in this country. Just because other countries are being *****, why does that mean we have to be *****?
 
 
Yes, there are plenty of very old Churches in many Muslim States, as well as new ones being built every now and then which are protected by Islamic law, as are Synagogues.

Unfortunately, governments sometimes cannot control thuggish attacks on Churches just as Western governments often cannot always control and prevent arson attacks on Mosques etc.

I believe Saudi Arabia has banned the open entry of non-Muslims into Mecca and Medina as they are already overcrowded as it is, and any new buildings would be crazy. And neither do these sites have any historical links with Christianity as Jerusalem does for example, so it is not denying Christians access to their pilgrimage sites (something prohibited by Islamic law). And to be fair, the Saudi government is also planning to restrict Muslims to one visit per so many years to limit the problem of overcrowding, especially during Hajj.
 
 
There are lots of churches in Egypt, Syria-Lebanon and Iraq. I think those countries stand between the puritanical Saudi Arabia and the Muslim-only-by-name Turkey.

Outside the M.E. the number of churches probably reflects the number of Christians.

A lot of Muslims would disagree with that.

Saudi Arabia is a very strict country, but the extent of their "Islamicness" is an entirely different question. We should be careful not confuse the strict application of their laws which they claim to be Islamic with a truly or "very Islamic country".
 
 
Under Islamic law, synagogues, churches, temples, etc, ARE allowed to be in Muslim countries

That is a rather unhelpful statement. What and whom does it tolerate? Apostasy? Criticism and satire? 'New' religions? Polytheism? Homosexuality? Atheism?
 
 
3 translations of the verse:
"009.029
YUSUFALI: Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.
PICKTHAL: Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily, being brought low.
SHAKIR: Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.

Well it is tolerant in the sense that a true muslim would be so intent on their own spiritual development that they would barely be bothered to judge what others are doing. My favourite muslims are sufi's (sadly persecuted by other muslims),and when you read their works they only talk about their own experiences,they are not bothered about others-and what can be more tolerant than that? In this spirit,jihad (holy war),means the battle you wage within yourself on the way to spiritual perfection, and martyrdom means killing the'self' (ie the ego),sometimes by the innocuous act of dancing (the whirling dervishes).

No its not

It doesn't follow a lot of the Sharia e.g having a leader chosen by the people and not a ******* monarch

As far as I am aware it doesn't have a welfare state and therefore the its justice system is completely illegal
 
 
sudan has loads of extravagant coptic christian churches on the banks of the nile, pakistan has loads of churches, egypt has a lot all if not most muslim countries have churches
 
 
I think it depends on the country to be honest...I think you will only find churches where a significant part of the pop. is Christian...I have never seen any in Somalia but I think there used to be some ? :|
 
 
Their are plentry of churches in muslim majority countries such as malaysia, syria, eypt ect. I think only suadi arabia has none and banned churchs.

Their used to be some the italians built for themselves during colonisation, but considering as somali's are about 100% muslims and have been for hundreds of years, their are obvioulsy no churchs.

It depends on whether the state is secular or not. But widely speaking, the only country like that is Saudi Arabia, but besides that, I don't know of any muslim-country that wholly does not allow churches to open.

Actually, Christians (and members of other minority religions) are persecuted to varying degrees in almost all Muslim-majority countries.

I get that Sufi people are generally rather peaceful, but would you really regard 'Sufi Islam', a genuine form of unaltered Islam? I wouldn't and no, I'm not a muslim.

Persecution of Christians does exist but that is more the fault of the rulers than the religion. Rights of the People of the Book are set out in Islam but the rulers have stopped implementing them. Institutional bias may exist but to say bombings and mass shootings are isolated incidents as Diaz89 said. Furthermore such persecution is restricted to only a few countries. It is an exception rather than the norm.

That is arguable. Either way, there are other ways to intimidate religious minorities.

Well seeing as the very Muslims of those countries enjoy little to no freedoms your point is ludicrous. Most Arab countries are shaped around socalist autocracies hence your attempt to bring Islam into this is moronic. Venturing to other Muslim states, they're either domintated by wealthy families or military dictators that were in no way elected by their citizens. Just with everysingle country there will be sectarian/ethnic tensions but Christians have generally done alright.

We can look at Egypt were there are many Copts who have obtained positions of power and influence in Egypt. There are at least two Coptic ministers in the current cabinet, and the country's most famous and successful businessman, the country's most famous international statesman ( former UN head Boutrous Boutrous Ghali ) are Copts

The city of Cairo is home to at least 16 MAJOR and several minor churches. At least one church in Alexandria is recognized as a UNESCO heritage site, and the bureaucratic laws restricting renovations of old churches were eased in 2005.

It cannot be, however, be denied that freedom of religion, among other forms of freedom of conscience, is heavily restricted across the 'Muslim-world'.

Spoiler:
A report by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, published last December, found that the vast majority of Muslim-majority countries place “high restrictions” on freedom of religion. This refers both to official curbs on faith and to the hostility that believers endure at the hands of fellow citizens.

'Very High' to 'High' Government Resrictions on Freedom of Religion:
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Maldives, Malaysia, Brunei, Afghanistan, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Yemen, Iraq, Western Sahara, Oman, Somalia, Indonesia, Mauritania, Pakistan, Turkey, Algeria, Turkmenistan, Libya, Sudan, Tajikistan and Jordan

'Very High' to 'High' Social Restrictions on Freedom of Religion:
Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Somalia, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestinian territories, Yemen, Nigeria, Comoros, Kyrgyzstan, Syria, Iran, Lebanon, Turkey, Algeria, Jordan and Chad

Furthermore, I must say also that I dispute your implied assertion that the reason for the lack of religious freedom in the 'Muslim world' is due to a lack of democracy. The Economist has this to say on the topic: Syria’s authoritarian rulers deal harshly with political dissent from any quarter, but it is easier to be a Christian there than in many neighbouring countries. If a democratic election in Syria brought Islamists to power, life would surely get worse for Syria’s Christians. There are several other Middle Eastern countries where secular dictatorships provide minorities with a protection of sorts. I agree with that assessment.

Churches in Pakistan --  http://pakistaniat.com/2007/01/02/ch...kistan-church/ 

Pakistan has recently had problems with Terrorist, but that is a Security Issue(blame incompetent goverment/America) not a Cultural one(in which you could blame the locals),

You talk about Sikhs, Hindus etc

Sikh have a really important gudwara in Lahore, the Pakistani government Facilitates indian Pilgrims, with Government Officials meeting them at the border
Compare this to India, Where Pakistanis are treated like S**** each time you phone Pakistan from India, u get a text saying why are you ringing pakistan, and Mosques are regularly attacked by Indian mobs despite this Pakistan still welcomes Indian Sikhs
 
 
yes they are

Quite frankly Iran is being picked on. I've been there and spoken to people from faiths other than Islam that are quite content.
Even Zoroastrians participate in Muslim ceremonies and vice versa.

Furthermore, the government restricts visas for foreign clergy under the age of 40 to inhibit "militant clergy" from entering the country. distribution of the Bible was restricted and required "Not for Muslims," be stamped on all Malay-language materials. What is also worrying is the discrimination and hardship faced by apostates and Muslim-minorities such as members of the Ahmadiyya community.

You get people of all religions in those schools but of course the school itself is convent etc. You get Fathers and Sisters in those schools. Both schools are well established, both get good results, give a good education. There are places of worship (Christian) inside the school (St. Joseph's). Both the schools are sited in the city center, very very close to each other and the city center has a high Christian population.

Pakistan isn't just made up of Muslims and Pakistanis are more than happy to have a diverse population. And yes, it is diverse, much more than people of the West seem to think.
 
 
All the major religions originted from the middle-east, so in the middle east they are allowed despite the countries being Muslim. I don't know about african or asian countries
 
 
yes, but the chances of the church being blown up by suicide bombers is 100%
 
 
You aren't allowed to even publicly practice Christianity in Saudi Arabia, let alone build churches.

Well one of the problems with Islam is that the original source ie the koran is written in arabic,and a very poetical form of arabic,so i don't feel as confident about reading it in english as i do say the great hindu,sikh,or buddhist scriptures.For me i believe there is a core truth at the heart of most religions,and that that truth is a universal one. So when i studied islam i felt that the sufi's (not all sects) were the one's most expressing the universal truth and therefore that their interpretation of islam was one which really reflected the true heart of that religion.
I think that there also have been epochs in islamic history where tolerance and learning have been a central feature of its practise.
Sadly i think that now there is an interpretation of islam that is very negative,intolerant,and divisive,and that this is being propogated in the west.
 
 
Churches are allowed to exist.. but there are heavy restrictions in the building of new churches in numerous muslim countries.

I think your idea about the 'heart of a religion' is nice, but then, to alter a religion and read various things into a religion which aren't truly there is to reform a religion, and the one thing about true Islam is that there isn't supposed to be any reform of Islam. Although people do twist it in all sorts of ways, bad and good, I don't hold sufi Islam in good light because of it's tendency to just throw chunks of Islam away and add in new bits.

Well as i said because the koran is essentially inaccessible to a non-arabic speaking person, I cannot claim to be an expert on islam.However,it must be open to various interpretations as there are various forms of islam,and we hear so many debates over what constitutes 'modesty'in dress for a woman. Also i think scholars are interpreting islam all the time inlight of changing circumstances etc. Also i think there are certain schools of interpretation which run alongside the koran, which then lead to the creation of various sects(sunni and shia for example).
For me the most consistent message of islam is in the name Islam itself,which according to the south indian sage sri ramana maharshi means 'Peace through surrender',in this case surrender of the self,or more specifically the ego(the sense of seperateness from God).
 
 
Most 'Muslim' countries have a large minority of christians.. christianity comes from the Middle East too remember. So yes, but I don't know about Saudi Arabia.

Egypt is about 20% Christian.. Lebanon like 40%.. Syria 10%.. 5% Jordan.. Palestine... so yes, churches are definitely allowed.

Like I said before, it's not always put into practice. Although, you might want to actually learn about the religion first before you judge all Muslims and their religion on the actions of the retarded minority.

don't judge the religion based on the people following it.

and saudi is... well.   they are a tad extremist, but i suppose it's for everyone's good. look at dubai and where that has gotten us.. don't know what to make of it really; but there's good and bad in everything. we (the uae) are not a very strict muslim country at all, but then again, a lot of bad things happen here and the needs of the locals tend to get neglected as a result of all the tourism, because we're not strict. it feels like we're selling ourselves and our identity for people who, at the end of the day, don't really give a damn.

saudi, on the other hand, is really really strict (bordering on extreme). women can't drive (technically, in the Prophet's time, women rode camels, so that's not against islam is it? and would you have a strange man (ie a driver) drive her instead? it would be safer for her to drive her own car.) however, the religion is respected by everyone and there is order and crime rate is extremely low.

so you see, there are good things and bad things in everything. but don't forget, you can't accurately judge a religion by judging the people who (don't necessarily) follow it. and i'm speaking about everyone; islam is perfect, but people aren't.

sorry for rambling

Does that include atheists? Gays? Hindus? Bahia Faith (the fourth Abrahamic religion)? And etc?

If the UAE is not a strict Muslim country then Islam is genuinely something to be afraid of. I mean, this is a country where:
- people get thrown in prison for mere kissing in public
- private and consensucal homosexual acts can be punished by death
- sex before or outside marriage is a criminal offence
- recreational drugs are strictly prohibited with dire punishment for drug traficking
- concensual acts such as gambling and pornography are strictly banned
- Foreign missionaries are not allowed to proselytize Muslims
- Abortion is illegal

A 'not very strict muslim country' would be Turkey, not the UAE.

Crime statistics are often better indicators of prevalence of law enforcement and willingness to report crime, than actual prevalence.

[QUOTE=Arab Blood]Does that include atheists? Gays? Hindus? Bahia Faith (the fourth Abrahamic religion)? And etc?[QUOTE]

As I said, ALL people are supposed to be tolerated, even if their activities go against the teachings of Islam. It's the same principle as in the Bible 'hate the sin, not the sinner.'

And by the way, I live in the UAE. It's laws seem quite austere but in practice the police turn a blind eye to alot of stuff, so in that sense it isn't very strict at all.

Look, the UAE may not be 'strict' according to your standards; however, most people would almost certainly consider it a strict Muslim-majority nation.

Yes, the practise of any religion other than Islam is strictly forbidden in Saudi Arabia - even in homes.

Buses, schools, cars, restaurants and even entire cities are segregated into Muslims and non-Muslims, and anyone caught even saying one word against Islam can be arrested by the   religious police .
