New Zealand's Jesse Sergent will meet American Taylor Phinney in the men's
individual pursuit gold final after qualifying fastest at the world track
championships later Thursday.

Sergent produced a blistering performance in his qualifying heat with reigning
world champion Phinney, pipping the 20-year-old American in the final two laps
with a winning time of 4min 15.988.

Phinney was second fastest in 4:16.102.

Jack Bobridge of Australia, last year's silver medallist, had timed 4:17.169sec,
and in the end that time proved only good enough for the bronze medal match
against Russian Alexander Serov, who clocked 4:18.356.
