All the experts were expecting the Tigers to run the table after the
Florida win last week.  It just ain't that simple in the SEC.  Kentucky
played a great game.

Now, let's see what the pollsters do to LSU.  They didn't even drop USC
out of the top ten after a loss to on unranked team at home, but I bet
they'll crucify LSU for losing to a ranked, one loss team on the road,
in overtime.

The SEC is the most unforgiving gauntlet in college football.

Any team that can get through an SEC season and championship game unscathed
should have the NC handed to them automatically.

When the conference expanded to 12 teams in 1992, Florida State and Miami
were courted, heavily, but neither one of those teams wanted to be subjected
to the SEC meat grinder and hurt their chances at (what were at the time,
practically a gimme) a National Championship.
