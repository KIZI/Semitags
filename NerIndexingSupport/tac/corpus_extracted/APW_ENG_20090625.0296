Russia's Supreme Court has thrown out the acquittal of three men tried for the murder of journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya.

Defense lawyer Murad Musayev told The Associated Press that the court reached the decision Thursday and ordered a new trial in the case.

Prosecutors had appealed against the February acquittal by a Moscow jury of the three defendants in Politkovskaya's October 2006 shooting death.

Politkovskaya angered officials with her persistent reporting of human rights abuses in Chechnya.

Her killing deepened international concerns about the risks journalists and Kremlin critics face, and added to strains in ties between then-President Vladimir Putin's government and the West.
