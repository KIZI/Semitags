 
 
I'm going to the Iowa Caucuses and you're not.
 
 
Well, as some of you know, I live in Iowa. I'll be caucusing tomorrow night at 6:30 CST. What advice, questions, etc., do you have for me?
 
 
Ha!

Wow.

You're certainly at the eye of the storm, there.

Who has impressed you as playing the game the best?

Who do you think comes across as most genuine?

What are your fellow-Iowans talking about?

What do you guys think about being so politically important?

What do you think about Clark skipping out entirely? (Was it entirely?)
 
 
I don't have any advice and I have so many questions that I don't know where to start. I'm counting on you, though. Good luck.... we're all watching.
 
 
Soz, I, as well as the majority of Iowans have been bombarded with phone calls and mail from political groups asking for our vote for their favorite candidate. The great thing about the caucus process is that you don't have to make up your mind before you go.

I've just recently started to think seriously about who I think can beat George Bush. I think most Iowans are like me. It's sooo early. We are reluctant to commit so soon, but the jig is up tomorrow.

I don't put too much stock in the importance of one state's results. Iowa gets so much buzz just because we're first. This event brings a lot of money to the state. We need money, so that's a good thing.

Re: Clark. I think he made a big mistake.
 
 
It IS so early. It seems unfair that the process starts in earnest already -- whatever the results, they will genuinely affect what comes next. I'm just glad that Iowans, in general, are sensible people.
 
 
Wow, lucky you, Swimpy! What mistake did Clark make? Joining the race?
 
 
Not bothering with Iowa. (He's been campaigning elsewhere, NE I think, just skipping the whole Iowa circus.)
 
 
Beautiful, swimpy. Wish I could be there.
 
 
Well, who do you like, Swimp?

Are you going to vote for one of the Big Four? Do you want to say who?

If that person doesn't get 15%, who is your second choice?

Tell us more about what's on your mind as you move toward a choice, as well as what any of your friends, relatives, and neighbors are thinking.

Enlighten us also about how the process works. I think it's still a bit of a mystery to many.
 
 
Oh yeah, cuz he entered so late? Bad move indeed. I think he's in NH tonight.
 
 
I agree, PDiddie. The news I want most from Swimpy is about the process.
 
 
Thirded.
 
 
I'm going to start with Kerry. I really think he's the candidate who matches up best against Bush. I think he'll be viable so I shouldn't need a second choice. I'll tell you more later. Gotta go.
 
 
...leaving us hanging!...

Looking forward to more tomorrow.
 
 
K, I'm back. This site has a pretty good explanation of the process.  Iowa Caucus FAQ 
 
 
Cool! Wish I were there, it sounds like quite the experience.

(This must be A2K... where people think going to Democratic caucuses is an opportunity to be jealous of <grins>)

 
I'm just glad that Iowans, in general, are sensible people.
 

As opposed to, say, Wisconians? <nods>
 
 
Habibi, I never thought I'd live to see the day when someone was jealous of me for living in Iowa! And about those Wisconsonites...you have to watch 'em veeeerrry closely <nods>
 
 
Re: I'm going to the Iowa Caucuses and you're not.

 
What advice, questions, etc., do you have for me?
 

Do you know neighbours, friends who are planning to come out for Dean, Gephardt, Edwards (Kucinich even, maybe)? What kind of people are they, what has determined their choice?

The punters serve us a cut-out profile for each - all Gephardt supporters are manly Teamsters, all Deanites are star-gazed students, et cetera... was wondering how it works in reality.
 
 
I'm jealous she gets to partake in the caucus, democrat or otherwise!
 
 
yeh, i was saying a2k-ers are politics-crazy, not that they're democrat-crazy! (tho face it, they're that, too ;-))
 
 
A Wisconsonite (the preferred term, nimh... and, to "Us", Iowans are "Flatlanders" :wink: ) here, just checking in. I get a little fuzzy Iowa TV, and a bit of Iowa AM radio. I'm gonna follow along as well as I'm able. I trust Swimpy will provide better info than The Pundits.

As I noted elswhere, an Iowa talk radio show this morning indicated that bakeries and pizza-delivery outfits are expecting a real surge in sales this afternoon/evening, which probably means turnout will be heavy.
 
 
It's funny you should ask about my friends and neighbors. I live in a place where it's considered impolite to talk about two things... religion and politics. I'll add abortion to that. I know a few people's opinions. A couple of Dean supporters and a Clark. Now Clark doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of finishing in the top three in Iowa. As I understand it, no person who did not finish in the top three in the Iowa Caucuses has ever been elected president. The Dean supporters are from Iowa City, a liberal bastion. Dean and Dennis Kucinich recently won the coffee poll at the Hamburg Inn #2 (I added that for Cobalt if she's listening.)

I expect some surprises tonight. I hope you will all be glued to the tube.
 
 
 
A Wisconsonite (the preferred term, nimh... and, to "Us", Iowans are "Flatlanders" :wink:)
 

Funny... what do Iowans call Wisconsonites?

What do you call someone from Illinois - an Illinoiser?

What does someone from Ohio call himself? Or, do they just prefer not to ever mention... ;-)
 
 
 
Funny... what do Iowans call Wisconsonites?

 

Cheeseheads.

 
What do you call someone from Illinois - an Illinoiser?

 
Illinoians (or Illini)

 
What does someone from Ohio call himself? Or, do they just prefer not to ever mention... ;-)
 

We call them Buckeyes...if we are forced to mention it.  
 
 
If I was Iowanese, I'd vote for Edwards. I wanna see that upset; 1. Kerry the Bay Stater, 2. Edwards the North Carolinian, 3. Dean the Vermon

BTW, I found this...
 http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0855542.html 
People from Connecticut are called Connecticuters. I thought they were called Connecticotians (rhymes with executions).
 
 
Indiananians?
Michiganites?
Floridese?
New Mexicans?

The mind boggles... ;-)
 
 
Floridians...
 
 
ok, ok, i checked the link. So its really Michiganites and New Mexicans, huh? That sounds funny.

The ones that got me, though, were Nutmegger (Connecticuter), Hoosier (Indianian), and Utahn (how d'ya pronounce that ?).

I mean - Hoosier? <uncomprehending>

What about people from DC? Are they called the same as their distant brethren on the West Coast, or something special, like... DCs, or something?

Not that I aim to kidnap the thread...
 
 
okay.....why is everything based on 1 state's opinions? Just because it's the first one to have a presidential event of sorts? I might be dummying it down, but that's pretty much what I've gathered from all the 'iowa caucus info' pages.... Now, I can understand how that says a candidate is probably going to do in iowa...but.....iowa isn't representative of the entire union, am i right? Like that comedian w/ the political debate show in HBO says "iowa is not the boss of me"

but swimpy - must be some kind of exciting to go huh? Have you gone before?
 
 
 
What about people from DC? Are they called the same as their distant brethren on the West Coast, or something special, like... DCs, or something?
 

(District of) Columbians
 
 
onyxelle, You're right. Iowa is not the boss of you anymore than other states with primaries are. It's the first so it gets a lot of attention. Some candiates will drop out if they do not finish well here. The idea is to narrow the field.

Nimh, I always called people from Michigan Michiganders.
 
 
 
As I understand it, no person who did not finish in the top three in the Iowa Caucuses has ever been elected president.
 

Yep, but 3 out the 6 last times, no winner of the Iowa caucauses (republican or democrat) has won the presidency.

1980: Carter & Bush (Winner: Reagan)
1988: Gephardt & Dole (Winner: Bush)
1992: Harkin and Bush (Winner: Clinton)
 
 
Swimpy
Swimpy, is there any way for people to vote who must work during the caucus hours and can't get to the location to vote? When I think of all the people who are on duty from 6:30 to prox 9 pm: police, fire, EMTs, hospital, retail, etc. Without an absentee ballot, a lot of people are disenfranchised including those too sick to go out on a cold night.

In New Mexico, the caucus system has just been instituted this year. But it includes absentee ballots, which I used. I may try to attend the nearest caucus just to see what goes on.

BBB
 
 
fbaezer, You are correct, sir.

BBB, I don't think so. This is an event that requires attendance.
 
 
Caucuses start in about 2 hours. I'll give you a report after I get home. Should be around 9ish my time.
 
 
Oooh! All anticipatory!
 
 
taptaptaptaptap
 
 
C-Span, right now, is televising a caucus live.

Switch over and watch what retail democracy looks like.
 
 
Surprising results so far! (To me.)

Kerry 37%
Edwards 34%
Dean 18%
Gephardt 11%

Only 20% reporting at this time.

Interesting!
 
 
ooh, thanks PDid!
 
 
About the same with 83% reporting.

Looking forward to Swimpy's report!! (9:00 her time/ my time now...)
 
 
Waiting/watching for Swimpy.
Interesting results so far.
 
 
Its over... blow-by-blow starts  Here , if anyone's interested. I can't wait for Swimpy to check in; I really want to get her take.
 
 
This is sooo interesting!

Swimpy made that comment about Kerry and I was kinda, hmmm. OK. I am now extremely happy to see him so far in the lead, and I can't put my finger on why. I am, though.

I told E.G. that, asked him if he'd read the story about Kerry meeting the guy he'd rescued in Vietnam after all of these years. He said no, then said "But that has nothing to do with..." I said, I know, I know. Then after a pause I said, actually, it does -- it has to do with whether he can beat Bush. And that is a huge consideration for me. Not the only. I won't vote someone into office I don't believe in. But huge.

Anyway, don't mean to drag this into yet another discussion of who should be the democratic nominee. Interesting process, interesting results, interested in what Swimp has to say about it.
 
 
Oh, a 1-2-3 statement of interest.   (All typing at the same time I think.)
 
 
OK, I'm back. What an interesting night. I'm going to type up my comments and post in a few minutes.
 
 
I arrived at my precinct caucus a little late but they were still registering people. The turn out was a record 68 people. By 7:00 two people had bailed out, so we were 66. Considering we were up against Bingo at the local Catholic church, that was pretty good!

The caucus was held at the elementary school in my neighborhood, which is pretty blue collar. There was open gym tonight, so there were people playing basketball until 7:30. That meant we had to crowd into a conference room to hear the candidate's representatives give their speeches. And when I say representatives, I mean whomever wanted to talk from the people aligned with each candidate. One lady, who was a Dean supporter got up. She had no prepared statement and just spoke from her heart. She was not educated and obviously nervous. She stood up and spoke so passionately, that if she had been running herself, she would have had my vote.

After the speeches, we gathered in our groups to count. We knew from the registration that there were only two viable groups. Kerry had 26 people and Gephardt had 11 (I think). A candidate needed 15% of the attendees to be viable. For my precinct that was 10. Dean had 9. Edwards had 4 and Kucinich had 1. Several were undecided. So the arm-twisting began. The edwards, Dean and Kucinich camps had 30 minutes to convince those who were either undecided or non-viable to join them.

As it turned out the undecideds split between Dean and Kerry. Edwards folded. Those remaining loyal to him left the caucus.

Kerry got four delegates, of which I am one. Gephardt got two and Dean one. We reflected the statewide results.
 
 
Nuevo Mexicanos, Boss... as far as the natives are concerned, the "Anglos" don't count...
 
 
Thanks for the meeting minutes swimpy! Sounds very cool....
 
 
Frankly it was a bit disorganized and lasted longer than it needed to, but that's grassroots politics for ya!
 
 
Thanks!! Fascinating.
 
 
hot DAMN!

<nimh was working the past five hours or so, and hadnt checked the web anymore...>

Daaaammmnnn....
 
 
Indeed!!  

Lookin' forward to your analysis, there...
 
 
Nice report, Swimpy, thanks. From my experience, that is exactly what grass-roots politics is like... on a good night. You ever been to a small town board meeting?
 
 
 
If I was Iowanese, I'd vote for Edwards. I wanna see that upset; 1. Kerry the Bay Stater, 2. Edwards the North Carolinian, 3. Dean the Vermon
 

I think Swimpy read my post and mobilized his troops.
Do I win something?
 
 
Excellent report, Swimpy! We Washingtonians have a caucus system, too. They will be held on Feb. 7, a Saturday, which suggests that they may drag on for many hours. A system like this must accentuate the impact of hard-core followers of candidates, since I doubt that many lukewarm folks would choose to spend their weekend this way.

Especially at caucuses like ours, which lack the glamour of Iowa's!
 
 
Timber, yes I have been to small town board meetings. There is a similarity.

man of yellow, You must have a chrystal ball there! (BTW, Swimpy be a she   )

D'art, I don't know about the glamour, maybe clammor is right description. It will be interesting to go to the County Convention. It's on a Saturday, I'm sure for the reason you stated.
 
 
Thanks, Swimpy.
 
 
 
Indeed!!  

Lookin' forward to your analysis, there...
 

Here you go... <smiles>:

 Which Democratic candidate will/do your support? 
 
Well, I've shifted. Call this a personal testimony, after all of the would-be punditry of the rest of my posts here.
 
 
 
 

(I actually responded there first 'fore I saw this...)
 
 
Cool  . Glad to have you on, first.

And to be helping to tease you back into "Politics" ;-)
 
 
Uh-oh... I'm in trouble now. Ah well, Swimpy is even further in than I am, I'll keep her company as we both go batty.  
 
 
Hehheh...
 
 
Here we go again!
 
 
Vote Hillary. as many times as possible. :wink:
 
 
That wasn't my first choice, bear.
 
 
um, so who is your 1st choice, swimpy, if we may ask?
 
 
I plan to caucus for Obama.

I like the new avatar, joe.
 
 
Beer and nachos on this thread as we find how Swimpy fares next week.
 
 
Wow! How thrilling! Wishing for safety, intrigue and good scoop!
 
 
rjb, I see you didn't get an avatar for xmas. sorry about that,

It should be an interesting caucus, what with the three front runners neck and neck and neck. I'm curious to see how the Biden, Dodd, Richardson & Kuccinich folk dvide up.
 
 
Hey Swimpy, let us know how it goes! Any reporting of impressions very welcome to curious observers from (far) away!  
 
 
MOVE OUT OF IOWA.
 
 
The Iowa caucuses, as we all know, are held in schoolhouses, hotel meeting rooms, village townhouses, maybe even in private houses. The number of folks assembled can range from big to small. Where will you be caucusing, Swimpy. I have my atlas open to page 60: Iowa.
 
 
 
I plan to caucus for Obama.
 

Yee haw! Go Obama!

How crazy have things been this year, Swimpy? How frequently are you getting phone calls from various campaigns, door knockers, etc?

As for what to ask...

 
If you are elected President, what do you foresee as your talking points at your first State of the Union address? What will you have accomplished and what is next on your agenda for the remaining three years?
 
 
 
Go Swimpy!

I will caucus in the basement of a retirement home that used to be a hospital. (I was born there and used to work there in high school.) It's a very small place. I remember going there by mistake last time and the place was packed.

Last time my caucus site was an elementary school. I started out in a small room, but eventually we took over the gym.

LOTS of phone calls. The phone rings incessantly. It's either pollsters or recorded messages from candidates or local organizers announcing visits by candidates. Thank god for caller ID! Joe Biden's going to be in town tonight. I know he doesn't stand a chance, but I would like to meet him. I think he's a good guy.
 
 
The new state motto...

IOWA... Rock out with your caucus out....

IOWA.... Our caucus' are bigger and come first.
 
 
 
I plan to caucus for Obama.
 

swimping against the tide?
 
 
Ar Ar Ar
 
 
I supect that during the brief period when I did standup, you were one of those people out there in the dimly lit audience whose 'laugh' didn't come from the belly. May your mother get blackbug.
 
 
Edwards is going to surprise everyone. Thats my prediction.
 
 
Stephanopoulos (sp?) had an interesting show this morning... They predict Edwards will have a good showing because of his precinct team. They also predict that a good Edwards showing in Iowa is a win for Clinton.

They don't think Iowa will have legs...direct legs, anyway...

Funny as HELL to see him interviewing Hill...knowing of the way he gutted her in his book...
 
 
I agree that Edwards has a good chance of doing well on Thursday. It'll be interesting. That's for sure.

blatham, don't take it so hard, dear.

Very well. I shall take it soft.
 
 
Good  
 
 
Hours to go. I think there will be a heavy turnout on the Democratic side. Even my 86 year old MIL is going for the first time.
 
 
Over here on the right coast we're hearing that things are very different out there this year! New caucusers.....
 
 
Sleep well, swimpy. A long day tomorrow.
 
 
I've been looking forward to this for so long that I'm just a tiny bit woozy.

So interested in your report/ impressions, Swimpy.

Not sure if I'm looking forward to the actual caucus results. While obviously I want Obama to do well, I'm also concerned that it will end up as a "hung jury," as Axelrod put it -- after all this, no clear winner at all.
 
 
Delayed gratification. I've always thought it over-rated.

How has it been with the calls and stuff, Swimpy? I read somewhere that previous caucusers were getting as many as 20 (!) calls a day from the campaigns, pollsters, etc... that's just madness.
 
 
This evening should be interesting.

The good stuff is finally here.
 
 
Nimh,

She answers that here

 http://www.able2know.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=3012919#3012919 

No doubt it has gotten even worse since her answer because of all the calls to supporters asking if they need babysitters, rides, directions, etc.
 
 
I haven't counted the calls, but they are coming fast and furious. Last night I got a call from Newt Gingrich! I hung up on him. (It as just a recorded message, dammit!) Trouble is, even though I have caller ID, they sometimes block their info. Sometimes I just answer for the heck of it.

I answered one night and the person asked if I wished to participate in a poll. I played a long until I realized it was a push poll asking my opinion on all manner of nasty news reports about Barack Obama. At that point, I expressed my wish to no participate any further.
 
 
There really ought to be pull polls. It seems only fair.
 
 
Heh!

"What do you like best about Obama?

1.) His appeal to Independents and Republicans
2.) His really fabulous Energy proposal
3.) His new brand of politics
4.) His prodigious oratorical skills?"
 
 
 
"What do you like best about Obama?

1.) His appeal to Independents and Republicans (maybe)
2.) His really fabulous Energy proposal (sort of)
3.) His new brand of politics ding ding ding!
4.) His prodigious oratorical skills? (that, too)"
 

It's sort of intangible. I get the sense from listening to him speak that he is a reasonable man with the desire to bring people from both camps together. I'm tired of fractured politics. Whether he has the ability to do it remains to be seen, but I'm willing to give him a chance to try.
 
 
Oh, thanks for answering the pull poll! :-)

Your take and mine are very similar btw.

When do you start caucusing?
 
 
They want everyone to be at their precinct sites by 6:30. No one gets in after 7. (They say that, but they will still let people in a few minutes late.)
 
 
Thanks.

Have a great time, and I look forward to your account.

Dude. Crazy.

On the one hand I'd love to be in Iowa in this time - you sure got the most exciting part of the elections! Plus, you got to actually exert influence - all the more so because of the low-turnout caucus model. (Low turnout compared to primaries, I mean.)

But on the other.. what a madness. The calls would drive me insane.

And Butrflynet, thank you for the heads-up to the earlier post! I'd missed that.
 
 
I'll be off soon. Expect to be back between 9 & 10 to report.
 
 
You on CSTime? Have fun!
 
 
She is, yep. Which makes that between 10 & 11 my time, which makes it after I've already gone to bed. Hmph. I'll be checking in bright and early, that's for sure.
 
 
My angels guide your footsteps. Or Teamsters depending on which direction you are swinging here.
 
 
Back already. I can only report my precinct results. We had 9 delegates to divy up. Hillary got 4, Barack got 3 and Ewards 2. No other viable candidates. I turned on MSNBC to find a three-way tie with Obama, Edwards and Clinton. It's way too early to call this race.

CNN has called the Republican race for Huckabee.
 
 
Oh, hi!

Right now CNN has Obama at 34%, Hillary at 32%, and Edwards at 31%:

 http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#IA 

Did the whole thing go faster than expected? I wasn't expecting to see so many results so soon.
 
 
The turn out at my precinct was HUGE. In 2004 there were 140 people at this precinct caucus. Tonight there were 226. That meant to be viable each candidate needed a minimum of 34 caucusers. Obama had 70, Hillary had at least 96. Dodd had no one show up. I didn't get numbers on the rest of the pack because the room was way crowded and communication was difficult.
 
 
Yea, it went way faster than I expected. People got in there groups right away and the first count was done before 7:30. The non-viables and the undecideds were given 30 minutes to either get with another group or go home. It didn't take long. Obama picked up a Kucinich and several Bidens and Richardsons. Apparently the candidates had givine the directive to their caususers to move to Obama if they were not viable.
 
 
65% of Democratic Precincts reporting. Obama leading with 35%...

I'm impressed. This is fast. Wow.

Wow, this is amazing!!!!

It's not actually over... stations have gotten in trouble for calling too early before...
 
 
 
MSNBC has called Iowa for Obama.

OBAMARAMA! FIRST OF MANY
 

I hope so too!!!

I can't believe that Huckabee made it for the Republicans. Oh my!
 
 
73% reporting, Obama at 35%, and CNN now projecting Obama as winner as well...
 
 
Do, you think, Swimpy, that some of the supporters of the 2nd tier candidates threw in the towel when they walked in, knowing that their guy had no chance?
 
 
I just talked to my son from Iowa City. At his precinct Obama was the only viable candidate in the first round. Hillary was gaining enough of the also rans to become viable in the end, but she won't get many delegates.
 
 
Damn...I'm HUNGRY!
 
 
 
Do, you think, Swimpy, that some of the supporters of the 2nd tier candidates threw in the towel when they walked in, knowing that their guy had no chance?
 

The Kucinich people (both of them) sat right down with us Obama folk. they knew they were't viable right off the bat. I was more surprised to see the Richardson people moving to Obama. For some reason I thought he would steer his people to Hillary.
 
 
 
I can't believe that Huckabee made it for the Republicans. Oh my!
 

This can only be a good thing for democrats - yes?

Uhm, no. 6th, actually.

Goodness.

<grins madly>
 
 
Eat!

And thank you for performing this valuable service. Seriously.

I'm surprised about Richardson too. We were talking about that earlier. I'd really thought he was lobbying Hillary for the #2 spot, and this sure wouldn't make that more likely. But then I had the thought that he's come to the conclusion that Obama is actually more likely to be bestowing the #2 spot.

Whatever, I'm surprised but VERY VERY VERY happy!!!

Well, they're saying that Huckabee won because of his evangelistic ties
to the area. Predominantly women voted for Huckabee. *gheezz*

It's always scary when such religious fanatics get ahead, even if it's
only in Iowa (for now).
 
 
I *mostly* think Huckabee has too many strikes against him to do very well if he's the Repub nominee, but the power of the religious thing scares me somewhat... the religious fanatic voting bloc is worrisome...

Very cool to hear a first-hand account!

Anastasia is clearing up (visitor tomorrow) and playing Popit - she's none too interested in the elections this time - but she liked hearing about your experiences. (And says hi in case you remember her).
 
 
 
 
 
I can't believe that Huckabee made it for the Republicans. Oh my!
 

This can only be a good thing for democrats - yes?
 

yes
 

Oh, Huckabee or Romney, either of them would be good news for the Dems if they win the primaries I think! So which of the two of 'em won is perhaps a neutral thing for the Dems...
 
 
But Huckabee would be more fun tho  
 
 
There's a big Romney question mark on his Mormonism. How much does it hurt him? It seems that those who would vote along religious lines went with Huckabee.

I think in the general there's a bigger disparity between the fundy's and the rest of us vs the Mormon's and the rest of us. In that regard, it does matter.
 
 
Swimpy, thank you from the bottom (and all that). You're the best.
 
 
I'd never vote for him, but I like Huckabee as a person (from what you can get during the debates/interviews, etc). He's a religious freak an all, which alone means I could never support him as a candidate, but still.
 
 
 
 
Yea, it went way faster than I expected. People got in there groups right away and the first count was done before 7:30. The non-viables and the undecideds were given 30 minutes to either get with another group or go home. It didn't take long. Obama picked up a Kucinich and several Bidens and Richardsons. Apparently the candidates had givine the directive to their caususers to move to Obama if they were not viable.

<waves to Anastasia> of course I remember you and I am thrilled to see you two together again.

OK folks back to your regular programing.
 
 
Huckabees the one I worry about because he is a genuine nice guy. He is appealing to a lot of people.

John Edwards is on TV now sounding like he is declaring victory.

Oh, nah. Don't worry about that too much.

See, the fiscal Republicans don't like Huck. At all. It will cause problems for him down the line.

This nation would go nuts over having to choose between Romney, the white mormon, and Obama, the black christian who went to school in a muslim country. It will be a very interesting exercise for our society if it holds true.

You get the idea, snood. He's likable in the way that W was likable. What he has going for him as well is that he's not an idiot.
 
 
 
He's likable in the way that W was likable.
 

Yeah, that's my concern-- those people that voted based on who they'd like to have a beer with before are still at large... We've gotta figure out how to disenfranchise those guys! (only sort of joking)

As for Bush, you gotta realize that the money guys lined right up behind him. Hell, they recruited him for the job. That isn't Huckabee, by a long shot.

Read about him at The Corner, or over on Redstate. Many Republicans do not like him, because of his fiscal policies.

Just saw - Chris Dodd dropping out.

You'd hope so, in a way, eh? But it's amazing, if you look at the number of people who say they'd never vote for a Mormon - it's far higher than the number who say they'd never vote for a woman, or for someone who's 70 years old, or for a black person, etc.

But it's not because he's Mormon that I think Romney is the easiest Republican frontrunner to beat in the general elections... it's because he is a soulless, unprincipled, flip-flopping Powerpoint candidate who's thoroughly failed to gain any kind of cross-over appeal over almost a year of campaigning.

In comparison, Huckabee at least is likable, has charisma, and has shown the ability to quickly move up in the polls among independent voters too as soon as he got more media attention. But Huckabee should nevertheless be beatable as well because he commits gaffe after gaffe and like you say, because he's just too much a religious fundy.

The Reps should go with McCain if they want more of a chance...

Well all that's my two cents of the day, anyway :wink:
 
 
Oh I fully realize that. I still worry. I remember how Reagan won people over with the same "Aw shucks" approach. Huckabee should not be overlooked.
 
 
Good night, folks. It was fun. I hope I can get to sleep now!
 
 
Good Luck!
 
 
You done good, Swimpy.

I think Huckabee is and would be far better news for dems because that will more abruptly and clearly work towards disconnecting the religious right from the republican coalition. David Brooks speaks to this in today's column...  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/04/opinion/04brooks.html?hp 

 
Huckabee won because he tapped into realities that other Republicans have been slow to recognize. First, evangelicals have changed. Huckabee is the first ironic evangelical on the national stage. He's funny, campy (see his Chuck Norris fixation) and he's not at war with modern culture.

Second, Huckabee understands much better than Mitt Romney that we have a crisis of authority in this country. People have lost faith in their leaders' ability to respond to problems. While Romney embodies the leadership class, Huckabee went after it. He criticized Wall Street and K Street. Most importantly, he sensed that conservatives do not believe their own movement is well led. He took on Rush Limbaugh, the Club for Growth and even President Bush. The old guard threw everything they had at him, and their diminished power is now exposed...

So the race will move on to New Hampshire. Mitt Romney is now grievously wounded. Romney represents what's left of Republicanism 1.0. Huckabee and McCain represent half-formed iterations of Republicanism 2.0. My guess is Republicans will now swing behind McCain in order to stop Mike.
 

He says also...

 
In that sense, Huckabee's victory is not a step into the past. It opens up the way for a new coalition.
 

We'll have to wait and see how this turns out. The rightwing corporate/washington power structure will REALLY be out to savage him now and the consequences of that will be a matter of unknown magnitude. But the old coalition is kaput now and even the boys at National Review have understood this for a few months (see  here  )

and...

 
Huckabee probably won't be the nominee, but starting last night in Iowa, an evangelical began the Republican Reformation.
 

As I think you've implied above, nimh, and as Brooks suggests, it looks now like McCain might manage to slip in. He poses some danger to a dem win but I really doubt it will be nearly enough to stop what increasingly looks like a serious and broad readjustment in the mood of the american electorate.
 
 
Thanks, K. I finally got to sleep, but it was not easy!

Thanks, Joe.

blatham, I will never count out the Republicans. If Huckabee gets traction, I would expect the rest of the party leaders to hold their noses and support him. They want a winner.
 
 
correction... in my post above, I linked to a NYRB article by tomasky which I hadn't fully read when I linked it. He goes on to argue, rather persuasively, that my rah rah for the decline of coalition strength in movement conservativism may be premature.

Iowa 1/4/07:

You dont bring me flowers
You dont sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come thru the door
At the end of the day

I remember when
You couldnt wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin me late at night
When its good for you
And youre feelin alright
Well you just roll over
And turn out the light
And you dont bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
But used to bes dont count anymore
They just lay on the floor
til we sweep them away

And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well I leared how to love
Even learned how to lie
Youd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
cause you dont bring me flowers anymore
 
 
 
 
 
Pass on a hello, please nimh.
 

She says hello back!
