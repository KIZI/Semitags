...cancer survivor and left handed pitcher Jon Lester just no-hit the Kansas City Royals.

Go Sox!
 
 
The whole cancer survival thing was orchestrated to create a major story out of Boston. Much like Schilling's fake ankle injury, with the fake blood on the sock. The Royals were part of the conspiracy yesterday, and threw the game for the Sox so they could have their next feel-good story. The Sox are the new darlings now.

 
 
 
Yup.

And the Patriots are the new Raiders. Everything's cyclical.

In a few years, with a couple more WS titles under their belt, the Sox will be the new Yankees.  
 
 
HA!

yea.. lets all dance because the ROYALS gave away a no hitter. WOW. An achievement, really.

 

If the AL sucks so bad that THIS was profound news of the day.. well..

Just can't resist the mani-charm can you.

btw: since you're such a wiki-slave, I would've thought you'd know how badly the NL has done in interleague play. Check it out.
 
 
Did I need a special Mani pass to post in a thread about baseball?

Dude.. you might wanna lay off the meth with a raging paranoia like that.

besides, it's no wonder theres a slight difference between the leagues when one of them protects their pitchers' nail polish with a DH. Still, at the end of the day, bragging about dominating the shit out of KC is kinda like bragging about shutting out the Arizona Cardinals while they are on a 5 game losing streak.
 
 
A no hitter in MLB is impressive no matter who the opponent. A true fan wouldn't need reminding about that.
 
 
Oh I know... kicking dirt in the eye of baseball masters like the Royals is truly something to brag about.

If this no-hitter hadn't happened, making national news, I'd have never known the Royals were even still a current MLB team.
 
 
thats what im sayin'.

The state of Kansas infects everything on that side of my state. It's not pretty.
 
 
In with a no-hitter, out with a broom!

Are the Royals on the Kansas side of the city? And what about BBQ?
 
 
from my perspective KC is just a little too close to jesusland.

Now, if you ever find yourself going through KC let me know and I'll suggest some bbq spots that you'll wind up telling people about with slavering memories.

the word for today is Slavering.
