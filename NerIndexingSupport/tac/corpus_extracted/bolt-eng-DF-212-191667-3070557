The rise of fanatical 'Israeli ayatollahs' is a godsend for anti-Zionists
By Julian Kossoff
 The rise of fanatical 'Israeli ayatollahs' is a godsend for anti-Zionists – Telegraph Blogs 

Last week, Israels foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman compared Turkey with Iran before the 1979 Islamic revolution. But if Mr Lieberman were to be honest, hed recognise that the greater threat to Israel from rising religious fundamentalism comes from within  on an almost daily basis.

At the same time as he was doing his tough-guy act with the Turks, Israels High Court was buckling to the fait accompli of sexually segregated bus services (women at the back) on over 100 state bus routes, demanded by an emboldened ultra-orthodox community.

On the same day, an Israeli activist who defied orthodox Jewish custom by leading a group of women in open prayer at Jerusalems Wailing Wall has been told to expect years in prison for breaching the peace  raising the prospect of Progressive Judaisms first prisoner of conscience.

The rabbis are now infringing on every aspect of Israeli life  even death. When the former Liverpool footballer Avi Cohen was killed in a motorcycle accident at the New Year, he had an organ donors card in his wallet  a campaign he had publicly supported.

His family agreed that his organs should be donated before he was taken off his life-support machine, but several so-called miracle worker rabbis objected. They told the family that taking his organs while his heart was still beating was murder according to Jewish law. The family succumbed to the pressure, even though potential recipients had been told organs had been located for them.

If these were purely domestic concerns they would be worrying enough for supporters of democracy and individual rights  but there are wider, existential ramifications.

Thus, as Israel and her friends around the world battle a raising tide of demonisation of the Jewish state, they are being undermined by rabbinic extremism.

This was starkly highlighted at Christmas when hundreds of Israels rabbis gifted anti-Zionism a godsend in the form of the despicable religious ruling barring Jews from selling or renting homes to non-Jews (Arab Israelis), published just before Christmas.

Hundreds of other rabbis, including some of the most revered ultra-orthodox figures, Israels president, her prime minister, the nations conscience in the form of Yad Vashem Holocaust shrine, survivor groups and the Anti-Defamation League denounced the blatant racism, but the damage was done.

Just as the anti-Israel lobby was rubbing its hands with glee at the a new line in its Israel  the apartheid state rhetoric, a group of rabbis wives (no doubt following patriarchal orders) added their own tinsel, with an open letter calling on Jews not to date Arabs.

In chapter reminiscent of racists lurid sexual myths, the wives warned of wily Arabs preying on innocent Jewish lovelies. Israeli society is falling into a deep, dark pit of racism and xenophobia, warned Rabbi Gilad Kariv, the head of Israels Reform branch of Judaism.

Israels founding fathers were committed modernists and believed the archaic Jewish sects would wither and die out in Zions brave new world. But, nurtured by bucket loads of tax shekels, today ultra-orthodox Judaism  for the first time in 2,000 years a state-sponsored religion  is a political power in its own right.

Most significant is the ultra-orthodox Shas party, a major component of Netanyahus coalition whose leader Eli Yishai controls the all-important Interior Ministry, responsible for many areas of Israeli life dealing with identity and Jewish recognition. In a recent interview Mr Yishai openly admitted to taking a daily phone call from Shass spiritual head, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.

Rabbi Yosef is a Jewish reflection of an Iranian ayatollah. Revered by his followers as a legendary theologian, his world view is medieval. His recent pronouncement that the recent devastating forest fires in Israels north was divine retribution for poor Sabbath observance was far from the most bonkers thing hes ever said.

Today, the militant Judaism of Shas is one half of a political pincer set on squeezing the democratic life out of Israels body politic.

The other half is the brawny nationalism of Lieberman (aka Israels Milosevic) and his Israel Beiteinu party supported by Russian Jews, now gunning for left-wing Israeli NGOs and human rights groups with McCarthyite fervour.

Privately, the ultra-orthodox may view the Russians as whores and half Jews, while the migrants from Eastern Europe suspect the black-clad Talmudists are work shy draft-dodgers, but their profound differences are masked by their shared extremism  for the present.

 

It looks like the whole world is becoming radicalised....
 
 
It's sad but true. I agree with almost every word in this article. I've protested against giving the Ultra-Orthodox more of my tax money and even got arrested for it. Unfortunately, just like everywhere else in the world, nothing changes, at least on the good side of things

Unfortunately bigross reasonable people like ourselves are becoming a rarity....It is idiots such as these in both our country's that is going to cause havoc for us while they sit back in their palaces and order the young citizens to kill each other.

I don't mind giving up my life for a worthy cause. I've been there with my buddies and my tank, been shot at and fired back. I'll not hesitate to go if the time comes and I'm needed. But I refuse to allow freeloading parasites to suck me and my friends dry because they would prefer to sit on their asses and read fairy tales as a friend of mine so aptly put it once

I hope your friend was not refering to the Torah??

Everyone would give their life up for a worthy cause for the greater good but no one wants to die for senile leaders.
 
 
Matter of fact, that's exactly what he was referring to. Maybe not the 5 books of Moses themselves or the 24 books of the Old Testament (though that's also debatable), but all the commentary and all the other stuff written about it

To dismiss any holy book whether it would be the Bible, Quran or Torah as "fairy tales" is very disrespectful in my view. We must respect every individuals view provided they don't advocate racial segregation or violence.

What about when that individuals views disagree with the holy books?

So why do you not respect my freind's view when he calls them "fairy tales"?
 
 
Actually fairy tales often do pretty much serve the same principle as the stories in the holy books. Using Stories and metaphers to enforce certain rules and social guidlines. The most famous example here should be works of the Grimm Brothers (though they did not create those stories, but "merely" collected, wrote them down and published them). All those had moral lessons or guidlines, though these are often easily overlooked. For example the story of Rumpelstiltskin deals with the alleged dangers of female masturbation.

My Israeli friend was refering to "fairy tale" in a different context I believe....

Does that extend to ALL holy books or religious writings? Does it include Scientologists & America's black 'Muslims' (the Elijah Muhummad group)? Why does people believing metaphysical tales to be true make the tales worth of respect in themselves?

As someone who has never believed in gods (believeing what others tell you as a kid doesn't count) I don't think that religious stories are any more or less worthy of respect than a fairy tale or a good novel. Some may seem more or less sensible to me, but that is my subjective view. Some may serve a useful instructive purpose, but so do lots of other stories (including fairy tales themselves).

Could I suggest a different formulation - personally I respect the right of people to believe whatever they please. In return I expect the right to say what I will about it. That doesn't mean I will necessarily go out of my way to insult people's deeply held religious beliefs, but the notion that I can't is offensive to my deeply held personal beliefs.

The rights of atheists must also be protected after all atheism is a belief in something too. It is a belief that no supreme being exists. But this too cannot be proved or disproved. No different from believing that a supreme being exists.

Please don't forget Freedom of conscience and Freedom of religion are fundamental tenants of a free and conflict free society.
 
 
But you haven't answered the question. Why must the ones reading the fairy tales be protected, but the one who calls them fairy tales not? He's not promoting violence or hatred, he's just expressing his opinion. Why is his opinion worth less than the one reading the fairy tales?

Bigross is not your friend covered under the right to Freedom of Conscience? Ofcourse he too is protected. Provided he does not mock others having a contrary view or provided he does not use his views in such a way as to provoke a response from people who have other views. All rights are balanced with other rights and the rights of others.

I think this is eventually going to lead to the following:
Why some reacted to the Prophet Muhammad cartoons (PBUH)...
Why some reacted to Burn a Quran day; and
Why some reacted to Burn a Bible day....

I will express my views prematurely with respect to the abovementioned:

All of the above are wrong and in breach of the UN Charter, inter alia.

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) cartoons were intentially used to provoke the Muslims/ Arabs. A picture of the prohet of Islam was put on a rocket to depict that all muslims were terrorists. The prohet of Islam and muslims themselves were also being grossly mocked.

Burning any holy book is wrong and a blantant disregard for other. It is disrespectful and aimed at provoking some sort of response.

Why don't people hold inter-faith dialogue days rather than provoke attacks on each other.

Why do some favour confrontation rather than reconciliation?
 
 
mmm, lots of juicy bait to jump for in this thread for a 'free speech' ayatollah  

but i'll leave it to this one...

 
It's sad but true. I agree with almost every word in this article. I've protested against giving the Ultra-Orthodox more of my tax money and even got arrested for it. Unfortunately, just like everywhere else in the world, nothing changes, at least on the good side of things

 

Why is your tax money going to support these people ?

Also, aren't things being a bit over dramatised here. Why does extremist anything always sound a lot worse than it actually is.
 
 
 
Please don't forget Freedom of conscience and Freedom of religion are fundamental tenants of a free and conflict free society.

 

~So is freedom of speech. That's us pagans you see, insisting you religious types don't get all the goodies.

Amen. Spoken like a good Baptist.  
 
 
 
Amen. Spoken like a good Baptist.  

 

Now THAT gave me a good laugh AG!     I was baptised Presbyterian, but in a church a literal stones throw from the most prominent Baptist church in Melbourne. Perhaps it rubbed off.
 
 
 
That is your personal view which should be respected by others.

 

But respecting that view means not telling me that I can't call their religious beliefs 'fairy tales'. How do the religious deal with that paradox?

 
But you cannot prevent others from believing the contrary either.
 

I'm not trying to prevent people from believing things, I'm trying to stop them using those beliefs to restrict mine. My beliefs let everyone, no matter what their beliefs, say their piece.

 
The rights of atheists must also be protected after all atheism is a belief in something too. It is a belief that no supreme being exists. But this too cannot be proved or disproved. No different from believing that a supreme being exists.
 

First, I'm not an athiest, I'm an agnostic. Second, there is a yawning gulf as wide as can be imagined between a worldview based on the existence of metaphysical beings & one where they don't exist. That doesn't mean that both can't be valuable & positive & both aren't worthy of respect by the other, but they are most definately NOT the same.

How does my formulation impinge this. Indeed, your idea that we can't call religious stories 'fairy tales' infringes what you wrote, not my idea that I respect the right to believe rather than the belief itself.

 
It extends to any belief provided that it does not promote violence or hatred.

 

I've taken this out of context to make a point. Below are just some of the ideas that Scientologists believe. They are 3rd rate science fiction written by a 3rd rate sci-fi author who turned out to be a first rate conman. I respect the right of Scientologists to believe this crap, but why should I repsect the crap itself?

I should point out that I can find stuff from most religions that is as silly as this, its just that we have become so accustomed to the stories that often the impact of the silliness wears off. Again, why should I respect the idea as opposed to the right to believe it?

 
The story of Xenu is covered in OT III, part of Scientology's secret "Advanced Technology" doctrines taught only to advanced members who have undergone many expensive hours of auditing and reached the state of Clear.[9][13] It is described in more detail in the accompanying confidential "Assists" lecture of October 3, 1968 and is dramatized in Revolt in the Stars (a screenplay written by L. Ron Hubbard in 1977).[9][19]

Hubbard wrote that Xenu was the ruler of a Galactic Confederacy 75 million years ago, which consisted of 26 stars and 76 planets including Earth, which was then known as "Teegeeack".[5][10][20] The planets were overpopulated, with an average population of 178 billion.[1][4][6] The Galactic Confederacy's civilization was comparable to our own, with aliens "walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like the clothes they wear this very minute" and using cars, trains and boats looking exactly the same as those "circa 1950, 1960" on Earth.[21]

Xenu was about to be deposed from power, so he devised a plot to eliminate the excess population from his dominions. With the assistance of psychiatrists, he summoned billions[4][5] of his citizens together under the pretense of income tax inspections, then paralyzed them and froze them in a mixture of alcohol and glycol to capture their souls. The kidnapped populace was loaded into spacecraft for transport to the site of extermination, the planet of Teegeeack (Earth).[5] The appearance of these spacecraft would later be subconsciously expressed in the design of the Douglas DC-8, the only difference being: "the DC8 had fans, propellers on it and the space plane didn't".[18] When they had reached Teegeeack/Earth, the paralyzed citizens were unloaded around the bases of volcanoes across the planet.[5][10] Hydrogen bombs were then lowered into the volcanoes and detonated simultaneously.[10] Only a few aliens' physical bodies survived. Hubbard described the scene in his film script, Revolt in the Stars:

Simultaneously, the planted charges erupted. Atomic blasts ballooned from the craters of Loa, Vesuvius, Shasta, Washington, Fujiyama, Etna, and many, many others. Arching higher and higher, up and outwards, towering clouds mushroomed, shot through with flashes of flame, waste and fission. Great winds raced tumultuously across the face of Earth, spreading tales of destruction...

 L. Ron Hubbard, Revolt in the Stars[9]

The now-disembodied victims' souls, which Hubbard called thetans, were blown into the air by the blast. They were captured by Xenu's forces using an "electronic ribbon" ("which also was a type of standing wave") and sucked into "vacuum zones" around the world. The hundreds of billions[5][22] of captured thetans were taken to a type of cinema, where they were forced to watch a "three-D, super colossal motion picture" for thirty-six days. This implanted what Hubbard termed "various misleading data"' (collectively termed the R6 implant) into the memories of the hapless thetans, "which has to do with God, the Devil, space opera, et cetera". This included all world religions, with Hubbard specifically attributing Roman Catholicism and the image of the Crucifixion to the influence of Xenu. The two "implant stations" cited by Hubbard were said to have been located on Hawaii and Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.[23]

In addition to implanting new beliefs in the thetans, the images deprived them of their sense of personal identity. When the thetans left the projection areas, they started to cluster together in groups of a few thousand, having lost the ability to differentiate between each other. Each cluster of thetans gathered into one of the few remaining bodies that survived the explosion. These became what are known as body thetans, which are said to be still clinging to and adversely affecting everyone except those Scientologists who have performed the necessary steps to remove them.[10]

A government faction known as the Loyal Officers finally overthrew Xenu and his renegades, and locked him away in "an electronic mountain trap" from which he still has not escaped.[7][20][24] Although the location of Xenu is sometimes said to be the Pyrenees on Earth, this is actually the location Hubbard gave elsewhere for an ancient "Martian report station".[25][26] Teegeeack/Earth was subsequently abandoned by the Galactic Confederacy and remains a pariah "prison planet" to this day, although it has suffered repeatedly from incursions by alien "Invader Forces" since that time.[5][27][28]

In 1988, the cost of learning these secrets from the Church of Scientology was £3,830, or US$6,500.[12][29] This is in addition to the cost of the prior courses which are necessary to be eligible for OT III, which is often well over US$100,000 (roughly £60,000).[7] Belief in Xenu and body thetans is a requirement for a Scientologist to progress further along the Bridge to Total Freedom.[30] Those who do not experience the benefits of the OT III course are expected to take it (and pay for it) again.[24]

The above rights I mentioned above are not absolute. There boundaries are defined by legislation.

The right to freedom of speech needs to be balanced with the right to freedom of religion and freedom of conscience.

E.g. The right to freedom of speech does not mean I can go around mocking or provoking other people.

In Western societies legislation defining the boundaries of the abovementioned rights are usually guided by Consequentialist moral theories.

Consequentialist moral theories are teleological: that is, they aim at some goal state and evaluate the morality of actions in terms of progress toward that state. The best known version of consequentialism is utilitarianism. This theory defines morality in terms of the maximization of net expectable utility for all parties affected by a law, decision or action. Although forms of utilitarianism have been put forward and debated since ancient times, the modern theory is most often associated with the British philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806- 1873) who developed the theory from a plain hedonistic version put forward by his mentor Jeremy Bentham (1748- 1832). As most clearly stated by Mill, the basic principle of utilitarianism is:

"Actions are right to the degree that they tend to promote the greatest good for the greatest number"

Based on this philosophy the abovementioned and at times conflicting rights would be balanced by legislative intervention based on a ratio which would achieve the greatest good.

E.g. In a Christian or Muslim majority society the scales would slightly weigh more towards the right to freedom of religion, when this right is being balanced with the right to freedom of speech. Why? Because the majority would be offendend by speech which would target the Christians or Muslim majority in that society and hence consequently the net good.

Although, those who may fall into the minority in such situations may find this as unfair, this is the philosophy behind modern day Governments throughout the world. In summary, the State will always lean towards the mainstream and majority views.

A fascinating philosophical discourse, but not a particularly useful contribution to this discussion. Even if you had provided some concrete examples from the societies relevant to posters here, the discussion has morphed into something a bit more personal & theoretical.

As for your assertions about 'modern day governments', it doesn't ring true in Australia & I'm betting the same is true in places such as the US & UK. I can think of instances here where Christian & Muslim groups have attempted to ban speech or expression they found offensive & have failed (much to my relief). I would feel equally strongly if secularist groups tried to prevent religious ones from criticising them.

Encouraging respect for different beliefs has value within bounds. Compelling it is increbibly dangerous.
 
 
 
I thought we were talking about values, not legislation.

State values are encapsulated in legislation. Our whole lives are governed by legislation from the day we are born to how our body is disposed of. All Western Societies are governed by the rule of law.

Why? Why should I have the right to restrict what others say about my beliefs? Why should they hold that power over me? I don't see that as 'balance', but rather oppression.

The Governments restrict and regulate certain things for the greater good of the country. Government's cannot make every single citizen happy. There are bound to be people who don't agree with government policy. But government is always driven by the notion of the greater good. This is the reality. The fact is that in democracies the minority is always bound to be "oppressed" to some degree/extent. Having said this while it is clear that democracy must guarantee the expression of the popular will through majority rule, it is equally clear that it must guarantee that the majority will not abuse use its power to violate the basic and inalienable rights of the minority. For one, a defining characteristic of democracy must be the people's right to change the majority through elections. This right is the people's "supreme authority." The minority, therefore, must have the right to seek to become the majority and possess all the rights necessary to compete fairly in elections—speech, assembly, association, petition—since otherwise the majority would make itself permanent and become a dictatorship. For the majority, ensuring the minority's rights becomes a matter of self-interest, since it must utilize the same rights when it is in minority to seek to become a majority again. This holds equally true in a multiparty parliamentary democracy, where no party has a majority, since a government must still be formed in coalition by a majority of parliament members.

Actually, it means precisely that.

Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth)
Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth)
Some Commonwealth of Australia legislation aimed at balancing the rights mentioned above.
Also please read Ch 5 Section 116 of The Commonwealth Constitution:
"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth".

It must be noted Section 116 does not apply to states because of changes during drafting, and they are free to establish their own religions. Although no state has ever introduced a state church (NSW restricted religious groups during the early colonial period), the legal body corresponding to many religious organisations is established by state legislation. Most states permit broad exemptions to religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation; for example, the NSW act allowing same-sex couples to adopt permits religious adoption agencies to refuse them. This is an example where slightly more weight is given on the right to freedom of religion rather than the right to freedom of speech and conscience in NSW.

Encouraging respect for different beliefs has value within bounds. Compelling it is increbibly dangerous.

Legislation preventing attacks (not only physical attacks) on other groups (or its members) or prohibiting ethnoreligious discrimination is just an example of compelling respect for different beliefs.

 

There is a long battle going on in the US where Anti-abortionists (fueled by religious belief) is in constant confrontation with groups that believe abortion shall be legal. This shows that sometimes no matter how much balancing you try to do it could always fail.

Disagree with the notion of 'right to be offended' either by the minority or the majority.

Nobody has such a right to obstruct freedom of expression.

Because they choose to compromise -read- dilute on principle in exchange for political expediency.

It's a copout plain and simple and ought to be flagged as such.

Suppose a terrorist organisation or supreminist groups giving flyers out about their filthy and inhumane ideologies. Do you believe the government will allow this under the disguise of freedom of speech or expression? Or better do you believe in their right for freedom of speech and expression in such instances. No one in their right mind will. Or suppose Mr. Ahmedinejad declaring that the Holocaust did not occur. Do you believe the victims of such event in history will accept such as freedom of speech or expression? Suppose an individual drawing children in sexually inappropriate ways. Does he have a right to freedom of expression? Absolutly not. Everything has limits and the Goverment has the right to balance/limit such rights for the greater good of society.

Check out countries that understand what freedom of speech means. The western countries to a certain extent qualify but only the US has the most liberal read of the lot. This is the model to follow. They are literally the last bastion, everybody else has less.

 
Or suppose Mr. Ahmedinejad declaring that the Holocaust did not occur.

 

I don't believe in hate speech as thats just a hack attempt to limit free speech.

 
Do you believe the victims of such event in history will accept such as freedom of speech or expression?

 

They would be offended but i've already said it does not matter. Them taking offense isn't grounds to stop ppl from speaking. Because there is no way to normalise that offense in a general population.

Anyone can take offense at literally anything, where do we draw the line ?

 
Suppose an individual drawing children in sexually inappropriate ways. Does he have a right to freedom of expression? Absolutly not.

 

This is a potential borderline case, more specifcs required.

 
Everything has limits and the Goverment has the right to balance/limit such rights for the greater good of society.

 

Don't confuse my position as an absolutist one. I clearly draw the line at incitement, anything less is diluting rights.
 
 
- Right to Offend
- Right to freedom from offense
- Right to speak freely

So many rights and all intertwined. Obviously there are strong emotions on all sides.

Already, States have passed "Hate Speech" legislation. While I strongly disagree with the notion of hate speech and hate crimes, it is already here. The problem - who gets to decide what groups are protected? Can the law apply to Gays but not the religious? Are Jews more protected than other religions? Do atheists/agnostics get protection from being told "You are going to hell?" which in my mind is a bit silly - if you are atheist, then the threat of Hell should mean nothing.

I think the best way to look at it is this - we don't make fun of the fat guy, mock him mercilessly. We don't make fun of mentally or physically challenged people. It is simple courtesy. Likewise, we should not mock strongly-held religious/non-religious beliefs. Again courtesy.

At the same time, we should not prosecute speech. People must be free to voice opinion, even if it offends. It is this that is so sadly lacking in Theocracies.

Simple courtesy and decency goes a long way when it comes to living in peace. If I am aware that mangling a Qur'an or Bible will really, really offend somebody, I will refrain from it - just as I'd refrain from mocking someone's body shape - but at the same time, I should not be prosecuted if I elect to do so anyhow.

And to those easily offended by such speech or actions - get a thicker skin.
 
 
Not sure if we are still on topic here in this thread, but whilst I agree with you in the most part CHOGY, (talking now of individuals not groups) its usually those who cannot defend themselves who are attacked/mocked/insulted/
 
 
I personally think that Jews should not be more protected than others. I think the word "antisemitism" is bandied about way too freely and easily and it has lost all it's power.

I don't think there is anything wrong saying that who sits and studies Torah all day is sitting on his ass and reading fairy tales. That's my friend's opinion, and nothing said here so far can take that away from him. It's not hate speech, it's not inciting to violence, it's the way he sees things.

No one loves a holocaust joke more than me, since laughing at it is my way of dealing with it and making sure it will never happen again.

And finally, I agree completely with Chogy's last sentence. What in the world happened to "sticks and stones"?

I still did not understand why your taxes should be used to facilitate that ?

Chogy:

You set out the principles well and raise the threat--now threats--to free speech, for, in addition to the mushy laws against hate crimes, the US is now in the process, state by state, of adding laws against bullying in schools. The latter may prove to be a nightmare of discretion, as these excerpts from the anti-bullying examples suggest:

Colorado: “Any written or verbal expression, or physical act or gesture, or a pattern thereof, that is intended to cause distress upon one or more students.”

Georgia: “Any willful attempt or threat to inflict injury on another person…or any intentional display of force such as would give the victim reason to fear or
expect immediate bodily harm.”

 http://www.stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/.../sbn_tip_6.pdf 

Who will decide what's bullying and what's just playful bantering? And will the law some day expand beyond the schools to the streets and the workplace?

I prefer, as you do, to trust in basic human decency. But more and more it seems that social advocacy groups are unwilling to trust in people's ability to manage their rights properly.
 
 
George Carlin really said it better than I could...
 
 
 
I still did not understand why your taxes should be used to facilitate that ?

 

It's kind of hard to explain, long story, you can find the explanation  here 
 
 
 
Colorado: Any written or verbal expression, or physical act or gesture, or a pattern thereof, that is intended to cause distress upon one or more students.

Georgia: Any willful attempt or threat to inflict injury on another personor any intentional display of force such as would give the victim reason to fear or expect immediate bodily harm.
 

You know, I think there is a world of difference between these two laws. The Colorodo law seems intended to prevent someone from saying "Your hair looks weird." as if the recipient would crumble into a blubbering heap and be non-functional for weeks. But the Georgia law seems better focused on preventing violence.

I don't believe free speech should allow one to say "I am going to kill you." That is the threat of an action as opposed to an opinion.

It's definitely tricky, but I would lean towards making opinions protected. Saying "your weight makes you look like a beached whale", while tacky and cruel, is opinion... no overt threat.
 
 
 
It's kind of hard to explain, long story, you can find the explanation  here 

 

Thx, ben, now if we get back to the OP's post.

All i see is the orthodox is 'saying' lots of things.

They passed a ruling against donating organs but other than that...

This is a group of ppl whom you might not agree with but all they're doing is associating with other like minded individuals and making statements. Statements that are not law.

They have not done anything wrong if we are to respect their freedom to express themselves.

Right ?
 
 
They don't serve in the army, do reserves, work or pay taxes. They can express themselves all they like if they decide they're going to be a proper citizen of the state. If not, then I have every right to say they sit on their ass and read fairy tales. They can express themselves even when they're not a proper citizen, in which case I firmly stand by the statement that they sit on their ass and read fairly tales
 
 
denizkuvetleri,

Can I make a practical request - can you only use the 'quote' function to highlight what you want to reply to rather than inserting your replies into a quote of mine. The way you are doing it now is a pain to reply to easily.

 
State values are encapsulated in legislation. Our whole lives are governed by legislation from the day we are born to how our body is disposed of. All Western Societies are governed by the rule of law.

 

All well & good, but I want you to explain to me why you should have the right to compel me to speak respectfully about your beliefs or those of anyone else. Wandering off into a discussion of principles & philosophies of government isn't achieving that end. Several of us have challenged an assertion tou made about the need to respect others religious beliefs. I would like to deal with that before we move on.

 
The Governments restrict and regulate certain things for the greater good of the country.Government's cannot make every single citizen happy. There are bound to be people who don't agree with government policy. But government is always driven by the notion of the greater good. This is the reality. The fact is that in democracies the minority is always bound to be "oppressed" to some degree/extent. Having said this while it is clear that democracy must guarantee the expression of the popular will through majority rule, it is equally clear that it must guarantee that the majority will not abuse use its power to violate the basic and inalienable rights of the minority. For one, a defining characteristic of democracy must be the people's right to change the majority through elections. This right is the people's "supreme authority." The minority, therefore, must have the right to seek to become the majority and possess all the rights necessary to compete fairly in electionsspeech, assembly, association, petitionsince otherwise the majority would make itself permanent and become a dictatorship. For the majority, ensuring the minority's rights becomes a matter of self-interest, since it must utilize the same rights when it is in minority to seek to become a majority again. This holds equally true in a multiparty parliamentary democracy, where no party has a majority, since a government must still be formed in coalition by a majority of parliament members.
 

Sorry, I have absolutely no idea what trhis has to do with answering this:

 
Why? Why should I have the right to restrict what others say about my beliefs? Why should they hold that power over me? I don't see that as 'balance', but rather oppression.
 

You are waffling on about government etc. without giving me a straighforward reason why I should be compelled to limit what I say about the beliefs of others.

 
Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth)
Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth)
Some Commonwealth of Australia legislation aimed at balancing the rights mentioned above.
Also please read Ch 5 Section 116 of The Commonwealth Constitution:
"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth".

It must be noted Section 116 does not apply to states because of changes during drafting, and they are free to establish their own religions. Although no state has ever introduced a state church (NSW restricted religious groups during the early colonial period), the legal body corresponding to many religious organisations is established by state legislation. Most states permit broad exemptions to religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation; for example, the NSW act allowing same-sex couples to adopt permits religious adoption agencies to refuse them. This is an example where slightly more weight is given on the right to freedom of religion rather than the right to freedom of speech and conscience in NSW.
 

Again, I have no idea what this has to do with what I wrote. How does application of anti-dsicrimination legislation to religious bodies relate to your stated belief that I shouldn't be allowed to call their beliefs 'fairy tales'? I can always tell that someone doesn't really understand how Australia functions when they start quoting the Federal Constitution & even legislation. We aren't America. As in Britain, legal precedent plays a huge role in shaping the day to day reality of policy here. To give an example, to read Victoria's laws one would think that abortion only became legal several years ago, yet legal precedent has made it widely available since the late 1960s.

In my own state a Christian preacher was taken to a tribunal charged with vilifying islam in the following manner:

 
Catch the Fire Ministries operate an internet site. That internet website contained a Newsletter (Summer 2001) which implied that Islam was the enemy who planned to take the land (Australia). It predicted that Muslims will rapidly increase in population and overtake Aussies. It predicted that Muslims will infiltrate all aspects of Australian public and religious life with the purposes of preventing the name of Jesus being mentioned and spying on western governments. It suggested that the motto of Muslims is to convert the world to Islam by peace or violence and that Muslims in Australia will engage in the same kind of violence as that which occurred on September 11. CTFM later withdrew these statements from the website. The ICV believes the statements on the website were capable of inciting fear, hatred and serious contempt for Muslim people.

The Catch the Fire Ministries internet site also included an Article entitled An Insight into Islam by Richard. The Article suggested that Islam was an inherently violent religion and that terrorism was the very nature of Islam. It stated Islam calls for the destruction of people wherever they may be found. CTFM later withdrew this article from the website. The ICV believes the article was capable of inciting fear, hatred and serious contempt for Muslim people
 

The Islamic Council of Victoria won the case but had it overturned on appeal. So, this sort of thing is legal here.

On another occasion The Catholic Church sought to ban the showing of the artwork 'piss christ'. Not only did they fail, but the image ended up on the front page of newspapers & was thus dispayed in thosands of places all over the city.

 Piss Christ - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 
Legislation preventing attacks (not only physical attacks) on other groups (or its members) or prohibiting ethnoreligious discrimination is just an example of compelling respect for different beliefs.
 

I oppose such legislation unless it deals directly with incitement to violence.

 
There is a long battle going on in the US where Anti-abortionists (fueled by religious belief) is in constant confrontation with groups that believe abortion shall be legal. This shows that sometimes no matter how much balancing you try to do it could always fail.
 

Again, what is the relevance here? Whose rights to free speech are being infringed in this case & how?

As a courtesy, before you wander off into another dissertation on government, could you explain to me why I should respect Scientologist beliefs about Xenu? To re-state my position, I will fight for the right of Scientologists to believe any sort of bad sci-fi fantasies they want, but why should I be restricted in experssing an opinon on its worth?
 
 
This is actually a great example of good intentions producing terrible outcomes.

 
Suppose a terrorist organisation or supreminist groups giving flyers out about their filthy and inhumane ideologies. Do you believe the government will allow this under the disguise of freedom of speech or expression? Or better do you believe in their right for freedom of speech and expression in such instances. No one in their right mind will.

 

I can assure you that I am in my right mind & I support the right of any group to express an opinion. I DO NOT want some bureacrat or even an elected politician telling me what opinions are permissible.

The exception, as DE has pointed out, is incitement to violence. Even them I think we need to tread carefully.

I want the views of these groups to be out in the open. I want them to be widely seen & I want the same laws that protect their speech to protect my right to point out how dangerous, wrong & evil such ideas are.

 
Or suppose Mr. Ahmedinejad declaring that the Holocaust did not occur. Do you believe the victims of such event in history will accept such as freedom of speech or expression?
 

As someone who studies & has occasionally written history I can tell you that one of the very worst things we could ever do is gove governments the right to decide which historical facts are acceptable & which are not. Holocaust deniers are the scum of the earth, but the only way to historical truth is free & open exchange of ideas, even ones that might seem offensive.

Turks & Armenians should be free to argue their cases about the Armenian Genocide. So should israelis & palestinians about the nakba, Japanese & the whole Asia Pacific about WW2 & Russians & Armenians about the holmodor. On that topic, I have a former Professor who is an expert in Russian history. As a result of his research on the holmodor he has been labelled a 'genocide denier'. What should his punishment be?

 
Suppose an individual drawing children in sexually inappropriate ways. Does he have a right to freedom of expression? Absolutly not. Everything has limits and the Goverment has the right to balance/limit such rights for the greater good of society.
 

Actually, Australian authorities have taken your lead. As a result a mother was arrested for showing photos she took of one of her very young children. She was charged & the case took 8 years & considerable financial & personal cost to be resolved (not guilty thankfully). Apparently the crime was not exhibiting the photos, but actually taking them. This means that my mother & father are criminals. So are millions of parents, grandparents & family friends in Australia & hundreds of millions worldwide.

It is important to prevent the exploitation of children in pornography, but prosecuting artists & photographers (and just ordinary folk) for work simply because it depicts naked children. A classic example of precisely why it is necessary to be VERY careful with state-imposed censorship.

Of course, the big difference here is that child pornography is harmful to children, so there is actually some useful purpose served by regulating (very carefully) naked images of children. Forcing people to publically respect the religious views of others prevents open discussion of important ideas & steps on vital civil rights.

 
Photographer Concetta Petrillo, later an art history lecturer at Edith Cowan University, was charged in 1995 under s 320(6) of the Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913 with 'indecently recording a person under 13', ie photographing her sons - sans figleaf - in classical poses.

She was acquitted of the charge in 2003, after two years of preliminary hearings and substantial expense.

The case was echoed in the UK during 2001 with calls for prosecution of photographer Tierney Gearon over an exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery. (UK newsreader Julia Somerville was arrested when she sought to collect domestic snaps that showed her daughter naked in the bath.)
 

 Unauthorised Photography: Incidents 

 
CONCETTA PETRILLO: They said the crime had been committed when I pressed the shutter release on the camera. Really the reason behind the images and why they were being done and the fact that it was an artwork had nothing to do with the actual crime. It was the fact that I had taken the shot. And I thought that was a bit wrong because to me the reason and why you were doing them was important in the whole process of why the thing existed

Well put Chogy. Some people just need to take a big 'harden the fvck up' pill when it comes to their personal beliefs.
 
 
 
The above rights I mentioned above are not absolute. There boundaries are defined by legislation.

The right to freedom of speech needs to be balanced with the right to freedom of religion and freedom of conscience.

 

Because there are NOT rights, there are ideas derived from " enlighten " philosophers with to much time on their hands.
if you were born in north Korea or any other god forsaken place on this Earth, you would know how much the right to freedom of speech and the right to freedom of religion is worth.
But hey...you still got freedom of conscience  
Doubt the " enlighten " monarchs could grant it or tyrans take that away.

 
In Western societies legislation defining the boundaries of the abovementioned rights are usually guided by Consequentialist moral theories.

Consequentialist moral theories are teleological: that is, they aim at some goal state and evaluate the morality of actions in terms of progress toward that state. The best known version of consequentialism is utilitarianism. This theory defines morality in terms of the maximization of net expectable utility for all parties affected by a law, decision or action. Although forms of utilitarianism have been put forward and debated since ancient times, the modern theory is most often associated with the British philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806- 1873) who developed the theory from a plain hedonistic version put forward by his mentor Jeremy Bentham (1748- 1832). As most clearly stated by Mill, the basic principle of utilitarianism is:

"Actions are right to the degree that they tend to promote the greatest good for the greatest number"

Based on this philosophy the abovementioned and at times conflicting rights would be balanced by legislative intervention based on a ratio which would achieve the greatest good.

 

The state gives, the state can take it away... sounds like a privilege to me.

 
E.g. In a Christian or Muslim majority society the scales would slightly weigh more towards the right to freedom of religion, when this right is being balanced with the right to freedom of speech. Why? Because the majority would be offendend by speech which would target the Christians or Muslim majority in that society and hence consequently the net good.

 

As long as they don't start beating others to death the lowlifes are granted even the privilege of hate speech.

 
Although, those who may fall into the minority in such situations may find this as unfair, this is the philosophy behind modern day Governments throughout the world. In summary, the State will always lean towards the mainstream and majority views.

 

Though luck  
Altrough the state grants several privileges to the minorities, if it considers that their preservation would improve the state development as a hole.
Call it a utilitarian view if you like  

back on topic :

the Ultra orthodox tribe has enough privileges already, struck them down and walk away.

In rise of ultra-Orthodox, challenges for Israel

By Matti Friedman, Associated Press

JERUSALEM  Dramatic changes may be coming in Israel: Demographers now estimate about a third of last year's Jewish babies were born into the ultra-Orthodox community, an insular and devout minority that has long been at loggerheads with the rest of the increasingly modern and prosperous country.

Ultra-Orthodox Jews  known in Hebrew as "Haredim," or "those who tremble" before God  have a birthrate far higher than that of other Israeli Jews, with 10 children in a single family not uncommon.

Although Haredim are not the only form of Orthodox Judaism -- Jews who follow all rules of the religious life. Modern Orthodox, while also observant, participate in contemporary culture in dress, employment and participation in the military. Israel does not give religious recognition to the less strictly observant Reform and Conservative branches of Judaism that dominate in the United States.

Relations between Haredim and other Israelis have never been smooth. Critics have long complained that they shun work in large numbers in favor of religious study, rejecting mainstream Israel even as they rely on that mainstream for financial support.

But increasingly, even some Haredim share a sense that things cannot continue as they are.

"The Haredim have set up a state within a state and have a long conflict with the state of Israel, which is now on the eve of an explosion," said Kobi Arieli, a popular radio host and author from the liberal edge of the Haredi community. "There is no chance that this situation will continue."

Many community leaders chafe at change, and are especially sensitive to secular concerns about their growing population.

"What does society want us to do, kill ourselves? Our community is a fact and everybody needs to understand that we exist and are not going anywhere," said Rabbi Shmuel Pappenheim, a spokesman for the Eida Haredit, an umbrella group of ultra-Orthodox factions. "This community will continue to thrive and nobody can change it."

Part of the issue is the community's poverty: About half of ultra-Orthodox adults do not work, and many men are full-time Torah students with government stipends that anger the secular majority but are nonetheless quite meager. Of the estimated 700,000 Haredim in Israel  around 9% of the population  just under 60% live below the poverty line.

If Haredim don't begin working in larger numbers, the financial daily The Marker posited this week, "this threatens Israel's future."

Perhaps the most corrosive issue is the military draft. Israel's early leaders agreed to support seminaries and issued several hundred draft exemptions, but over the decades, as the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews ballooned, so did the number of full-time students with exemptions. Today there are around 50,000. The law that exempts them requires them not to work, lest they lose their exemptions. The arrangement that has resulted is unique to Israel; abroad, ultra-Orthodox Jews work and their communities support themselves.

Last week, in unusually strong language, Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, criticized Israelis who do not serve in the army, including the masses of young Haredi men. Those who do not serve should be "ashamed," Ashkenazi said.

That feeling is widely shared, and pressure is growing to find ways to draft Haredi youth. But the community's strong political parties have foiled attempts to reduce the draft exemptions, cut funding, or force ultra-Orthodox schools to teach basic subjects like English, math and science.

Socially and politically conservative, the ultra-Orthodox parties prefer to align with rightist coalitions that have pursued more hardline policies. Although they have supported left-leaning governments as well  generally when these had majorities without them anyway  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described them as his natural allies.

The Haredi lifestyle is inspired by the Jewish world of eastern Europe that was destroyed in the Holocaust. Comprising a mosaic of sects and factions of varying shades and beliefs, they share a tendency to reject a secular society they see as morally corrupt and to sanctify religious study, modesty and charity.

In Israel's early days, the precursors of today's Haredim rejected Zionism and pioneered what they called the "learning society," which meant that all young men  and not just a small intellectual elite, as had been the case in Europe  were to devote themselves to religious study instead of work. This was meant to restore the world of Torah scholarship that had been destroyed by Nazi Germany. Over the years, many Jews who emigrated to Israel from the Arab world also have joined this camp.

They mostly live in separate neighborhoods and study in separate schools, with little interaction with a majority that has largely come to view them as a burden.

The interactions that do exist are charged, with secular Israelis often resenting what they see as attempts to impose Haredi religious mores on others. This month, for example, saw tiffs over gender segregation on some bus lines in Haredi neighborhoods, and over similar segregation at a concert in a secular area to be attended by Haredim.

Because it is difficult to precisely define who is Haredi and who is not, exact figures on the community's population and birthrates are difficult to come by. A November 2010 report by two demographers at Haifa University, Arnon Soffer and Evgenia Bystrov, estimated that 30% of the Jewish newborns are now Haredi. Government statistics predict that by 2025 the Haredim will have jumped from 9% of the population to 15%.

"We are not yet seeing the full strength of the process of ultra-Orthodox growth," the demographers wrote  this "will be felt when the young generation reaches the age of military service and work." The demographers warned that the economy would not be able to support a bigger Haredi population.

Alongside those concerns is a nascent feeling that change is slowly coming.

Ultra-Orthodox society is not monolithic or static and there are signs of movement, said Sergio DellaPergola, a demographer at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

The number of ultra-Orthodox men serving in the army or performing national service has quietly inched upward from almost none a decade ago to several thousand today, and the government voted this week to encourage more to join. The army has formed special programs tailored to ultra-Orthodox needs, where men can serve in male-only environments and eat food meeting the strictest standards of Jewish dietary law.

Over the same period, the number of Haredim in professional training programs has risen from several hundred to 6,500, The Marker reported. The number of Haredi men with jobs has risen 8% in eight years.

This foreshadows greater changes, said Arieli, the Haredi author. Many young Haredim, he said, are simply unwilling to live in isolation and poverty.

"It will happen slowly," he said. "From year to year more and more Haredi youth will join the army and go to work. This is what is already happening, and it will change everything."

denizkuvetleri,

Can I make a practical request - can you only use the 'quote' function to highlight what you want to reply to rather than inserting your replies into a quote of mine. The way you are doing it now is a pain to reply to easily.

I don't know how to use the 'Quote' function

All well & good, but I want you to explain to me why you should have the right to compel me to speak respectfully about your beliefs or those of anyone else. Wandering off into a discussion of principles & philosophies of government isn't achieving that end. Several of us have challenged an assertion tou made about the need to respect others religious beliefs. I would like to deal with that before we move on.

Lack of respect towards a fellow citizen would lead to confrontation and division especially in countries where education levels are very poor and people can't express themselves verbally without resorting to violence. Especially in multi-culatural societies. It is then in the best interests of the State to restrict or balance the various conflicting rights by achieving the optimum compromise between them.

Sorry, I have absolutely no idea what trhis has to do with answering this:

You are waffling on about government etc. without giving me a straighforward reason why I should be compelled to limit what I say about the beliefs of others.
You would cause confrontation and division within the State. The unity of the State is vital for it to prosper. Furthermore, you are free to express your beliefs provided that you do not incite violence, mock or intentially provoke others.

Again, I have no idea what this has to do with what I wrote. How does application of anti-dsicrimination legislation to religious bodies relate to your stated belief that I shouldn't be allowed to call their beliefs 'fairy tales'? Please read my post carefully. There is a point I am trying to make with respect to how rights are always balanced by legislation. I can always tell that someone doesn't really understand how Australia functions when they start quoting the Federal Constitution & even legislation. We aren't America. As in Britain, legal precedent plays a huge role in shaping the day to day reality of policy here. To give an example, to read Victoria's laws one would think that abortion only became legal several years ago, yet legal precedent has made it widely available since the late 1960s. I am well aware of the Doctrine of Stare Decisis. It must be noted that under the Federal and State Acts Interpretation Act the Commonwealth Legislation will always take precedence over the Common Law (that is judge made law).

In my own state a Christian preacher was taken to a tribunal charged with vilifying islam in the following manner:

The Islamic Council of Victoria won the case but had it overturned on appeal. So, this sort of thing is legal here.

I oppose such legislation unless it deals directly with incitement to violence.

Again, what is the relevance here? Whose rights to free speech are being infringed in this case & how?

As a courtesy, before you wander off into another dissertation on government, could you explain to me why I should respect Scientologist beliefs about Xenu? To re-state my position, I will fight for the right of Scientologists to believe any sort of bad sci-fi fantasies they want, but why should I be restricted in experssing an opinon on its worth?[/QUOTE]

Respecting another view does not mean accepting or approving it. It is merely a way of preventing human confrontation which can lead to disruption of the norm/status quo. My discussion about Government and the philosophical rationale behind the notion that rights must be balanced is directly linked with the Governments duty to maintain the peace and good order of society. In summary, I was trying to get to the point that Governments will always protect mainstream ideas which are prevailant in a society at any given time in order to not confront the majority. And fortunately the majority of the time it works. The reality is that if we gave individuals absolute rights that is, the right to absolute freedom of speech, the right to absolute freedom of religion people are bound to abuse these rights, leading to confrontation and conflict. The State cannot afford to set the ground for such conflict in the name of freedom of speech or freedom of religion. Accordingly, it is for this reason that such conflicting rights are balanced. Or more clearly put, it is for this reason that Government draws the definiing boundaries by legislation.

With respect to your example of the Scientologists in my opinion you or anyone else for that matter should not be restricted in experssing an opinon [emphasis added] on its worth. However, getting into the knoses of the individuals practicing Scientology, mocking them, trespassing on their premises, provoking them or stalking them or inciting violence against them exceeds the right to expressing an opinion. It is this excess which Governments regulate and I believe have a right to regulate.

If we allowed unrestricted and absolute freedoms to individuals, all we would end up with is an endless supply of tit-for-tat attacks between various groups. A waste of human resources and a major desruption to the State.
 
 
 
Because there are NOT rights, there are ideas derived from " enlighten " philosophers with to much time on their hands.
if you were born in north Korea or any other god forsaken place on this Earth, you would know how much the right to freedom of speech and the right to freedom of religion is worth.
But hey... you still got freedom of conscience  
Doubt the " enlighten " monarchs could grant it or tyrans take that away.

They are rights incorporated in the UN Charter developed from enlightend philosopers. Can you please re-read my posts and see what I am talking about. In no where in my posts did I state that the Right to Freedom of Speech or the right to freedom of religion must be discarded. All I have stated is that in any modern day society such rights are always balanced with conflicting rights.

The state gives, the state can take it away... sounds like a privilege to me.

No one is giving it or taking it away. It is merely being regulated/balanced by the State for the greater good of society. They are fundamental rights to any modern day free society.

As long as they don't start beating others to death the lowlifes are granted even the privilege of hate speech.

Not in every jurisdiction.

Though luck  
Altrough the state grants several privileges to the minorities, if it considers that their preservation would improve the state development as a hole.
Call it a utilitarian view if you like  

back on topic :

the Ultra orthodox tribe has enough privileges already, struck them down and walk away.

D: I think you're missing out on something very important:

 
You would cause confrontation and division within the State. The unity of the State is vital for it to prosper.
 

Unity of the state is most definitely not required for it to prosper. The only time you get complete unity of the state is in a dictatorship where there is only one acceptable opinion. Every other country in the world has division in the state.

Of course, there are countries with no division, like the PRC that are doing quite well, and there are countries like the USA: Democrats, Republicans, Tea Party, Libertarians, Liberals, Greens, etc..., and are still in a recession. But to say that division in the state leads to lack of prosperity is a bad generalization and should be avoided.

 
Furthermore, you are free to express your beliefs provided that you do not incite violence, mock or intentially provoke others.
 

Bullshit. Do you mean to tell me that every single satirist or stand up comedian that makes fun of somebody is in the wrong? Than why does everybody laugh? Inciting violence is one thing, but mocking people is acceptable and recommended.

Provoking people is too broad. Are you provoking people to think by telling them their thought process is faulty? Whats wrong with that? Do you have something against a thesis counselor coming down hard on a student in order to push them further so they'll get better results? What about when I make fun of my sister when she makes a stupid mistake, just so she can come back the next day and try and prove that she's smarter than I am? Who exactly is hurt there? Definitely not me, and definitely not my sister, who is trying to make herself smarter in order to put me in my place.
 
 
 
...
I prefer, as you do, to trust in basic human decency. But more and more it seems that social advocacy groups are unwilling to trust in people's ability to manage their rights properly.

 

I too think legislation is a bit too much. The thing is Kids are a lot more instinctive at an earlier age without parental guidance. The child is not a harmless innocent. The child is a pack animal where possible, easily going along to get along. In the end I think that costs the economy billions... You expose the child long enough with repetition from multiple subjects and the simple fact is the receiving child reacts to that - sometimes in tragic ways, ironically more so if the child has had a good upbringing as they are more likely to assume a victimhood/repressed hope cycle which perpetuates often into split personalities until the individual finds a way to break that cycle often not very successfully.

I personally hope that society holds a great deal of skeptisism in Social advocacy groups than the papers lead me to beleive.

Inciting violence is one thing, but mocking people is acceptable and recommended. We are not talking about satire here. I'm sure everyone can distinguish between comedy made by a comedian and hate speech by a KKK member.

I'm talking about the burning of bibles in front of a Church or congregations of believer or the burning of Quaran's in front of a mosque. Both these acts are done in a bid to provoke a response. States such as Lebanon, Egypt, the USA, Australia cannot afford to have such tension amongst it's citizens. The product would be eventual civil unrest.

You are free to call them as you like, I'll do it, how I see them in my utilitarian view.
Free speech is granted to allow cultural, political and technological development of the State.
Freedom of religion is granted to mitigate the interfaith conflicts that might divide the state along artificial lines.
I'm perfectly fine with limiting the freedom of speech if it leads to division of the state along artificial lines.
Others will probably disagree,but on the mater of balancing conflicts within the state I agree with you.
 
 
 
I was reffering to acts higher up in the spectrum. There is a difference between differing political views and ethnic or religious tensions within a society.
 

There is no difference. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If it is inciting to violence or some other sort or form of measurable harm, then it is unacceptable. Anything else goes.

 
We are not talking about satire here. I'm sure everyone can distinguish between comedy made by a comedian and hate speech by a KKK member.
 

Once again, no difference. They are both protected speech. There is definitely a slippery slope here, and if someone takes action based on the KKK member's speech, then we're dealing with a different story entirely, but until then, they are both protected

 
I'm talking about the burning of bible in front of a Church or the burning of Quaran's in front of a mosque. Both these acts are done in a bid to provoke response.
 

Of course they are! There'd be no point in doing something in order to not provoke a response, would there? And as it stands, both the burning of the bible and the burning of the Quran are protected. Don't like it? Go somewhere else or don't look. But so far you've yet to give me one valid reason why that kind of speech is unacceptable.

What you're promoting sounds very much like you're condoning the censorship of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons, since they caused riots. Here's one of the protestors opinion on those cartoons: "They want to test our feelings.They want to know whether Muslims are extremists or not. Death to them and their newspapers."

Report: Tal Law failing; needs legislative changes

Committte's interim report calls to 'adjust law to society changes'. Recommends recruiting third of haredim to full IDF service

Kobi Nahshoni
Published: 01.16.11, 15:38 / Israel News

The government recently approved the reform plan intended to double the amount of haredim enlisting in the IDF and National Service program within five years, however now it turns out that the previous initiative in this regard, the Tal Law, has failed to yield results.

A statement issued Sunday by the committee tasked with examining the Tal Law, which exempts ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students from army service on religious grounds, concluded that it is simply not working.

The report called to enforce mandatory IDF service or significant National Service on all citizens. The committee members added that without any legislative changes made to the law, it will be unsuccessful in strengthening the principle of mandatory service, national or military, among the Israeli public.

Committee Chairman Knesset Member Yohanan Plesner (Kadima) presented the document to his colleague MK Shaul Mofaz (Kadima).

The report discussed some "positive trends" within the haredi public regarding the service, but the committee still called for legislative and policy changes to "adjust the Tal Law mechanisms to changes in society."

The committee determined that it would be better to recruit haredim to the IDF than have them perform National Service, "so as to secure the principle of equality and preserve the value of the IDF service."

The committee recommended recruiting at least a third of the haredim who belong to the class of 2015 to the IDF, while another third would join the National Service.

According to the plan, the rest of the haredi class of 2015 will be allowed to continue its Torah studies in yeshivas, but the goal will remain to recruit as many of them to a shortened service period and integrate them into the IDF reserve force.

The committee also called to gradually raise the number of haredi recruits in 2016 "until mandatory service for all becomes normalized", while a small group of excelling students will still be permitted to study in yeshivas.

"The political echelon must instruct the IDF to broaden the existing courses for haredi service and provide a budget for them," the report stated. "A multi-year plan is necessary, emphasizing the military service. Meanwhile, out of concern for the Israeli economy, the haredi integration courses in the IDF should also be developed because they contribute to their integration in the job market."

The report also mentioned a number of administrative changes which are required in order to fulfill the purpose of Tal Law, including making the National Service the responsibility of the Prime Minister's Office and not of the Science, Culture and Sport Ministry so as to give it a more "national appeal".

The committee also proposed to open a special recruitment track - a national-security service for haredim aged 22 and up. "It will help with the manpower shortage," they explained.

 Editor's Notes: Rabbi. MK. Heretic? 

 
By DAVID HOROVITZ
01/07/2011 15:35

Shas claims its nonconformist MK Haim Amsalem is aligned with the ‘haters of Torah.’ But is it really Amsalem who has betrayed authentic Judaism?
Talkbacks (16)

Toward the end of this interview in his Knesset office, Haim Amsalem pulls a pile of five bound volumes of e-mails and letters from a shelf, and plunks it onto his desk with a satisfying thud. “These,” he says proudly, “are from the last month and a half alone. It’s an awakening community.”

Every day, more letters of support stream in – “from the US, France, Peru, Hong Kong...” But mainly, of course, from Israel. “I spoke to Army Radio this morning,” he says. “Immediately, more people phoned. The Israeli public hears what I’m saying – and it’s not just the haredi and Orthodox publics. It’s the public across the spectrum.”

There’s no doubt about it. Amsalem – an MK who was first elected in 2006 with Shas, to that party’s current profound regret – has struck a nerve. Or rather, two.

For the first time in its history, a credible and hitherto dutiful insider has shown the guts to stand up and shout that Shas and its emperor have no clothes – that far from restoring Sephardi glory, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef’s various smart-suited political operators are failing their trusting public by misrepresenting the requirements of authentic Judaism, and misrepresenting Yosef in the process.

Amsalem’s first chosen battlefield is incendiary enough. In advocating a halachically lenient approach to conversion, the rabbi-politician has provoked furious opprobrium from the rabbinical establishment, while garnering delighted support from those who recognize that the current stringent approach has alienated hundreds of thousands of nonhalachically Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union.

His second focus is arguably more revolutionary still. From within the ranks of the Sephardi ultra-Orthodox political establishment, Amsalem has emerged to challenge the untenable norm which has seen the Ashkenazi Lithuanian haredi leadership encourage its followers to eschew military service and employment in favor of Torah study as the most elevated use of their time. It is an untenable norm that his own Sephardi Shas hierarchy faithfully endorsed – thereby, as Amsalem puts it, condemning the very community Shas purports to help to “a vicious cycle of poverty.”

Amsalem relentlessly stresses his respect and fealty to the party’s spiritual leader – “HaRav Ovadia gave the inspiration [for Shas],” he says. “He led the Sephardi spiritual revival.” Nonetheless, Amsalem has branded Yosef’s Shas, his own Shas, not merely misguided, but veritably disastrous to its constituents. Its ideology, or rather the Lithuanian ultra- Orthodox ideology which it slavishly adopted, he argues still more shatteringly, is nothing less than a betrayal of Judaism.

After all, he declares, citing a string of quotations, it is a central, indisputable Jewish precept that a father is obliged to educate his children so that they can earn an honorable living. Hence, says Amsalem, youngsters should be given a rounded education, in the core math, English and science curriculum as well as religious study, the better to find work as adults.

And yet Shas – the party that aspired to champion Sephardi tradition but has nonetheless remained deferential to the Lithuanian establishment – has in its nearly three decades of Yosef-directed political activism told its followers to do nothing of the sort. “For a glass of milk, you don’t buy a cow,” Amsalem fumes, then noticing my baffled expression, elaborates: “You don’t send hundreds of thousands into a framework with no means to earn a living in the hope that one great Torah scholar will emerge. It’s not fair and the Torah does not require it.”

In a ferocious critique, Amsalem recalls that Shas was really founded by the late Lithuanian sage Rabbi Eliezer Schach and asserts that it has always been “directed, by remote control, by the Lithuanian spiritual leadership. The Sephardi yeshiva world is not really Sephardi. In fact, all of the [leading figures] learned at the Ashkenazi Lithuanian yeshivot, and they implement those teachings among the Sephardim.”

Yosef, he says, though certainly a remarkable scholar, was “the persona” selected as a figurehead for this Lithuanian-engineered phenomenon. And today, Amsalem indicates, access to Yosef is so carefully controlled by senior Shas figures that the sage is starved of the information necessary to give the movement the appropriate halachic-Zionist leadership it cries out for.

Unsurprisingly, the Shas hierarchy has reacted to Amsalem’s one-man revolt in blunt, sometimes vicious terms. In November, its four-man, Yosef-led, Council of Torah Sages essentially excommunicated him. It charged that he was ingratiating himself “with the haters of Torah.” It called some of his views heretical. It ordered him to return his Shas mandate and quit the Knesset. He refused.

The MK was then denounced as a desecrater of the Lord’s name in posters pasted up in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods of Jerusalem and in Bnei Brak. One of Yosef’s sons blamed him for the winter’s drought. The Shas newspaper Yom Leyom devoted pages to condemnations of his errant ways. And a writer there went so far as to liken him to Amalek, the descendant of Esau and biblical enemy of the Jews, whose progeny are ordered destroyed.

Amsalem’s office responded at the time that “the comparison to Amalek has but one meaning that is clear and dangerous,” and he was promptly assigned bodyguards. Eli Yishai, the interior minister and Shas party leader – branded “a dictator” by Amsalem in another interview and the subject of much implied criticism in this one – condemned the newspaper’s “unacceptable” comparison.

The two men are agreed on that, it seems, but on very little else.

HAIM AMSALEM, 51, was born in Algeria, moved to France as a young child, and came to Israel with his family at age 11.

He says his relationship with Yosef goes back decades – “I have always been very close to him... As a young man I was tested by him” – and that it was Yosef who gave him his rabbinical ordination. “My books met with his approval. I have been quoted in his books on more than one occasion.”

Before entering parliament, Amsalem had worked as a community rabbi both in southern Israel and in Geneva. He went into politics, he says, because he realized that “it is possible to change things today in the State of Israel, even in the rabbinic realm, only via the political world. The rabbinical world, unfortunately, has lost its ability to influence the public.”

Surely, though, he must have known the kind of party he was joining? He of all people, with that longstanding tie to Yosef. So why the sudden outraged assault on its policies?

It’s not that simple, says Amsalem. He had assumed that as an MK, as had been the case when he was a rabbi, he would always have “the option of going to the Rav, to discuss with him, to let him hear my opinion and to listen to his opinion.”

In practice, however, he claims, “the process of deterioration” began “from the moment that I entered politics. There were those” – the unnamed Yishai presumably prominent among them – “who did not appreciate this personal connection between myself and HaRav Ovadia – which stemmed from a rabbinical basis, not a political basis, and which could influence him deeply.”

Indeed, Amsalem is one of only two ordained rabbis (the other is Nissim Ze’ev) among the 11 Shas MKs. And his capacity to interact with Yosef on that level, as “a man of Halacha who has written books on Halacha... apparently that was a problem for some people.”

The gulf – ideological and then personal – between the Knesset member and his party, he says, opened very gradually. Ticking off the issues that have widened it, he begins with conversion. “You can’t be indifferent when it comes to IDF soldiers, some of whom are risking their lives for us, and some of whom have given their lives for us, and who are from ‘the seed of Israel’ – zera yisrael – that is, of Jewish origin.”

While the increasingly haredidominated state Chief Rabbinate has held to a stringent standard for the conversions of all FSU immigrants of Jewish patrilineal descent, and there is an ongoing struggle over the validity of conversions performed within the IDF framework, Amsalem says he follows “the line of great rabbinical authorities before me” that “they need to be treated differently.” A more lenient halachic approach is mandated, he argues. Jewish blood flows in these people’s veins, he says, and to ignore this “is neither halachic, nor humane.”

“In the State of Israel, we have almost half a million people like this. People with a father or a grandfather who is Jewish. They have Jewish names, but they are gentiles, because their mothers are gentiles. Throughout the Jewish world, there are millions of people in this category. I am not exaggerating. Millions. What am I to do with them? Should I push them away, against the injunctions of the Prophet Yehezkel? No, I need to offer solutions.”

Next, Amsalem turns to education, and his insistence that students in the Shas Talmud Torah school system be taught the general school curriculum as well as Torah studies.

“These studies are not only important in terms of the students’ capacity to find a future in the general professions,” he reasons, “but also for the sake of Torah study itself: You need to understand those core subjects in order to better understand the Gemara.” There are, he says, vast tracts of Gemara disputation – in Masechet Shabbat, in Masechet Kil’ayim, in Masechet Eruvin, in Masechet Succa – that cannot be properly fathomed “if you do not have a wider understanding.”

This brings him to the supremely vexed issue of full-time work over full-time study.

“For me, the capacity to earn a living with honor is a paramount principle,” he stresses. “The Torah does not require us to create a povertystricken society. The Torah requires that we create a society of quality, one that observes commandments, studies Torah at a high level.” But that does not obviate the imperative to work.

Amsalem has just returned, he says, from a trip to the United States, in the course of which he delivered a lesson in Halacha to a group of industrialists. “I was amazed at the standard of discourse, a standard that I don’t see in Israel,” he says. "Back here,” he observes with calculated provocation, “a wise student [talmid hacham] who studies in a good kollel, he’s at a good standard. But a student who does not study in a kollel is at a very low level. That model I encountered in America, the model that prevailed for generations – of people working for a living, with an education in Torah – why does it not apply here?”

Amsalem knows exactly why not: because the ultra-Orthodox leaderships insistently deviated from it in the modern State of Israel, securing widespread exemptions from IDF service for their youths, and sending them en masse to study. “You define it as ‘a deviation?’” he remarks. “So do I. If it had remained in the Lithuanian [haredi] world alone, well, that’s their position, and I don’t intervene in the Lithuanian world. There, it’s not a deviation. That’s their worldview. But for the Sephardi public, which does not subscribe to this view, and where it creates a society living in poverty, with no component of working for an honest living, well, it has to be put to an end. The alarm has to be sounded.”

Amsalem notes that almost all of the great Jewish scholars, throughout the generations, combined Torah study with honest labor. He supports nurturing the best and the brightest in full-time study – “otherwise we jeopardize our ability to create the future scholars, the righteous, the rabbis.” But employing an appropriate military metaphor, he adds that, “Just as in the army, not everyone can be in the elite commandos or the paratrooper, the same holds for Torah study: A portion will only study, a portion will study and work, and a portion will only work. There is nothing illegitimate in that.”

AT THE root of Amsalem’s maverick halachic thinking, it would appear, is the simple fact that he’s a Zionist.

He regards the reestablishment of the sovereign Jewish state as a divine gift. The beneficiaries, in his view, have a consequent obligation to participate in the state’s development. Not to do so, indeed, is to rebuff divine will.

“I define myself as a Jew, a God-fearing man,” says Amsalem. “I am also someone who regards the revival of the state of Israel as one of the greatest and most clear miracles that the Holy One Blessed Be He has performed for us. This is our state. We have to contribute to it. And that contribution has to be expressed in all kinds of areas. It can be a contribution via military service, via civilian service, via national service.”

Somewhat ironically, Amsalem did not serve in the army himself. Rather apologetically, he says, he was a communal rabbi who “asked several times” to be conscripted but was told “we don’t need you now.” Some of his eight children, yeshiva graduates, have served, however. “Most of the Shas MKs served and their children don’t,” he observes. “For me it was the other way round.”

“This is our state,” he says again, with gentle simplicity. “This is the state of the Jewish people. This was promised to us after 2,000 years in exile. And we have to do our bit for the state. That does not contradict my assertion that a yeshiva student who studies Torah, who really studies, can absolutely be regarded in the same way as were members of the Levite tribe, who sat and studied Torah only.”

He pauses, then drives the point home. “But not all the people of Israel are Levites.”

OSTENSIBLY CAREFUL not to deepen the bitter frictions still further, Amsalem is adamant that his opinions do not generally contradict those of Yosef – though that’s an assertion that doubtless only further infuriates his Shas detractors.

His books on conversion, he says, are actually based in good part on Yosef’s own thinking. “How do I know?” he asks rhetorically. “From what he has written and from the protocols of his work. He was the chief rabbi [for a decade from 1973]. He wasn’t cut off. HaRav Ovadia wasn’t a yeshiva head who gave a weekly lesson which you could understand or not understand. There’s a protocol: Who he converted, how he converted. He came to the Knesset. He explained his overview.”

As for the obligation to work, he asks in anguish, “Do I need to consult with someone about that?!” He quotes from Psalms, invokes Maimonides, offers a stream of mishnaic references, and concludes, “You don’t need particular wisdom to know this! These are simple matters. Every rabbi knows this.”

And he goes back to Moses in support of his demand that the faithful contribute to the well-being of Israel. “Moses our rabbi criticized those tribes that didn’t want to enter the Land and take part in the conquest,” berating them for a readiness to “just sit there” when their brethren were going out to war, Amsalem recalls.

Isn’t any of this resonating in Shas, I wonder? Doesn’t the party recognize that the devoted members of its constituency are having a seriously hard time getting by because they are doing what their political and spiritual leaders are telling them is right?

“I can only say that this community, because of its respect for HaRav Ovadia, gives its support to Shas,” he answers. “And in return, its children and grandchildren enter an impossible framework.

“There was a Channel 10 survey last month that showed 40 percent of Shas voters identify fully with my views,” he goes on. “I don’t need anything more than that. What am I supposed to do? Shut up? I can’t be silent. I hear the cry from ground level. People are wailing: ‘We can’t manage. We want to be able to earn a living.’

“Don’t forget that among the haredi public today you have 40,000 young men who are known to have dropped out – they are not in yeshiva, they are not in the army, they are not in the education system. I don’t know how many more are supposedly in yeshiva that have dropped out. What else has to happen? There is a hole in the boat. The captain has to fix it. Otherwise the boat will sink. He can’t ignore it. He has to go down to the belly of the boat...”

And who exactly is the captain? “I don’t know. But I see the hole and I’m trying to plug it.”

ALL OF which begs this question: Why would so peerless a scholar as Yosef allow the movement he oversees to so skew authentic Jewish tradition. “You have alighted on one of the most painful issues,” Amsalem allows.

Rather than answering directly, however, he notes first that “the general public regards HaRav Ovadia as a Zionist. HaRav Ovadia served the Zionist State of Israel as chief rabbi. He celebrated Independence Day. Yes, he celebrated Independence Day! And anyone who says otherwise is rewriting history. He took pleasure in the State of Israel’s celebrations. And he wrote halachic rulings that, perhaps, even reflect a Zionist worldview.”

So why, again, would this patently Zionist former chief rabbi and political inspiration allow his world view to be skewed by his ostensible loyalists?

The answer, Amsalem would appear to want to contend, is that the Sephardi sage, who turned 90 in September, is being manipulated by unscrupulous people around him.

Amsalem sighs. “HaRav Ovadia is a man of the Torah, whose whole world is immersion in the Torah. Nothing but Torah. [As regards current affairs], he is sustained by narrow channels of information. He doesn’t read the Internet. He doesn’t see daily papers. He doesn’t have time to listen to the radio. Maybe he listens to a two-minute news broadcast at 12 or at 2. Naturally, when someone comes in to tell him something, they tell him something.”

The point being that certain people – like, say, Amsalem himself – aren’t allowed to “come in to tell him something,” and that the rabbi, therefore, doesn’t get the full picture?

He sighs again. “On conversions, Shas is being told what to do in effect by the Lithuanians. It’s a tragedy. It would be simpler if HaRav Ovadia also received information from others... I have written many letters to the Rav on this issue. I don’t know that he ever received them. I assume he did not... I’ve tried several times to come and see him and tell him things.”

And?

“And it doesn’t work out. But let’s leave that matter there. I don’t want to elaborate.”

I persist that this is important.

“Okay, let me give you an example,” he offers, with only mild reluctance. “On a few occasions, I was summoned [to Yosef] apparently to be told off. One of those occasions related to the legislation protecting someone from prosecution if he shoots a burglar in self-defense. That legislation has its origins in a sentence from the Torah. Some in Shas wanted to oppose this law. It doesn’t matter why. I came and said, ‘Sorry, gentlemen, as a man of the Torah, a man of Halacha, I tell you that this law is correct.’ And I wrote a halachic explanation. And then I was summoned to HaRav Ovadia. I don’t know what they had told him [about my views]. But when I came and explained to him, he said [to his aides], ‘He’s right. You need to listen to him. He understands matters of Halacha.’”

This kind of denouement recurred more than once, says Amsalem. “And after that, I no longer had the opportunity [to come to the rabbi and explain]. It was understood that, on that playing field, it wouldn’t be me who would have the problem.”

FORMALLY, AMSALEM says he is still in Shas. More surprisingly, he says he still considers himself “a man of Shas” – even though, he grants with a rare, narrow smile, the party “is behaving rather indelicately on the matter” of his mandate.

He has no intention whatsoever of quitting the Knesset, as requested by the party sages. “I’ve said all along, please, let me have the necessary time with HaRav Ovadia. A fair trial requires that you give a man a hearing. I am absolutely loyal to his path. I am faithful to the Halacha. And everything they are trying to use to besmirch me, is just cheap politics.”

So it is the other Shas politicians who have abandoned Yosef’s path?

“I would go further,” Amsalem declares. “They haven’t abandoned his path. They don’t know it. I know it because I have walked after him for the past 60 years. The books that he published at age 24. His writings all through the years. It is all fascinating to me.”

And yet those around Yosef insist that it is Amsalem who has strayed, and the revered sage himself gives every sign of believing them.

“It’s like a computer,” he fires back. “The result is a function of the information you input.”

He acknowledges, with a broader smile, that Shas is unlikely to select him on its Knesset list next time around. “I imagine not,” he says, but seems supremely untroubled. He could reasonably expect to find a home in the National Union/Habayit Hayehudi environment, and says more than one party has made overtures.

“There’s time to think,” he says calmly. “I’m not closing any doors. If I am able to find a platform to advance my ideas, I’ll use it. I believe and so do others that you’ll see me back in the next Knesset. Perhaps even more active than today.”

Might he join forces with the irrepressible former Shas political leader Arye Deri, now preparing a comeback after serving his jail term for bribery? They might seem like a good match – these two independent Sephardi thinkers, these two bitter critics of Yishai.

At first, Amsalem seems to be saying yes: “Arye Deri proved that he is a talented man who can get things done. And everyone who shares my ideological line, who wants to put an end to this Lithuanian-Sephardi view, can be my partner. Anyone who says clearly that we have to make our contribution to society; who says, ‘We love the Land of Israel,’ call it Zionism; who comes along with halachic solutions and accepts halachic solutions, anyone like that is my partner.”

But then he adds in his unassuming tones, with their cadences that sound deceptively uncontroversial even when the content is biting: “I would remind you that the achievements that we have to date are thanks to Arye Deri. That’s why Shas looks the way it does today. This is a creation that I don’t agree with.”

Perhaps an Amsalem-Deri alliance isn’t so likely after all.

I remark that the goings-on in the court of HaRav Yosef, by his telling, sound worryingly similar to those in the palaces of various detached dictators – where malicious advisers regulate the inflow of information so that the boss only hears what they want him to hear. “I’ve said enough on this,” responds Amsalem.

But isn’t this the heart of the problem, I ask again, remembering that various Kadima sources have sometimes claimed that would-be prime minister Tzipi Livni was prevented from forming a coalition with Shas before the 2009 elections because aides to Yosef misrepresented to the rabbi some of her positions on peacemaking with the Palestinians? Isn’t Amsalem asserting that the leader of a party that directly represents hundreds of thousands of Israelis, and holds the balance of power in a parliament that represents us all, is being given skewed and partial information by his purported loyalists? Isn’t he claiming that, were Yosef given a fuller picture, he’d want things to unfold differently? And if that is the case, doesn’t that contain dismal implications for the entire country?

Amsalem pauses, considers an answer, then appears to think better of it. “That’s for you to say,” he eventually manages.

I ASK Amsalem, finally, about reports of threats directed at him for his ostensible heresy. He purports to be unfazed by any physical danger, but he certainly fumes at the Amalek comparison.

“The Sephardi rabbis, through the generations, were tolerant, moderate, they reached out to people,” he says. “To besmirch a rabbi? To call him Amalek?” He tails off, shaking his head.

Is it that a certain extreme Ashkenazi approach has influenced the Sephardim? “I grew up with Ashkenazim,” he responds. “Most members of the hassidic community work for a living. Almost all of that community abroad works. [The emphasis on mass full-time study and the generally rigid Halachic approach] is a Lithuanian worldview. I don’t know how it was created, but it’s militant and it’s cruel.”

Bad for Israel? “It’s bad for the Jewish people, yes,” says Amsalem.

And then the rabbi-politician who wants to save the Jewish state from religious fundamentalism delivers a parting mini-sermon: “The Jewish people has to set an example, to itself, of tolerance, of accepting the other, not to persecute people for their beliefs,” he says. “We don’t want to live under dark regimes. We came here to forge a different, better society. We are ingathering the exiles – Anglo- Saxons and French and Turks and Romanians and Moroccans and Iraqis – and we want a good mixture.

“Every group has its own customs. Some beautiful, some I like less, but I have to learn to understand them. I want you to respect me and I want to respect you. I want to know you and I want you to know me. I don’t want to impose my view on you, and I don’t want you to impose your view on me.

“And if on conversion,” he says, slowly and deliberately, confronting his invisible Lithuanian nemeses, “I want to do like my rabbis did in Morocco, don’t come to me with your rabbis from I-don’tknow- where and tell me that ‘only they know what’s right.’

“You don’t have a monopoly,” he declares, seething now. “Are you trying to monopolize the Torah? Well, there is no monopoly on the Torah. Torah is given to the wise for halachic interpretation. It’s my job to do just that.”
 
 
 
 
There is no difference. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If it is inciting to violence or some other sort or form of measurable harm, then it is unacceptable. Anything else goes.

Once again, no difference. They are both protected speech. There is definitely a slippery slope here, and if someone takes action based on the KKK member's speech, then we're dealing with a different story entirely, but until then, they are both protected

Of course they are! There'd be no point in doing something in order to not provoke a response, would there? And as it stands, both the burning of the bible and the burning of the Quran are protected. Don't like it? Go somewhere else or don't look. But so far you've yet to give me one valid reason why that kind of speech is unacceptable. Every country has it's differing interpretations about the freedoms discussed on this thread. I gave you many. Any speech which is prohibited by law for infringing anothers conflicting rights is unacceptable. It is not for me as an individual to decide how or if a right needs to be balanced with other rights. It is up to the majority of the public and the legislatures.

What you're promoting sounds very much like you're condoning the censorship of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons, since they caused riots. Here's one of the protestors opinion on those cartoons: "They want to test our feelings.They want to know whether Muslims are extremists or not. Death to them and their newspapers." I knew it would ultimately boil down to this hence I gave my views with respect to these at the begining of my posts. The vilification of any religion for political gain is wrong. Incidents such as these are merely populist moves to gather the masses against a different group. Had Mr. Jyllands-Posten drawn cartoons of Prohet Abraham (PBUH) with bombs coming out of his head he would have been declared an anti-semite and faced the same backlash. The Hollocaust was the product of what? Hitlers sickening filthy views! I wouldn't be surprised if there is a hunt-a-muslim day in afew more years. If we have people being allowed to describe all muslims as terrorists under the disguise of freedom of speech this is what will eventually happen.

denizkuvetleri,

Can I make a practical request - can you only use the 'quote' function to highlight what you want to reply to rather than inserting your replies into a quote of mine. The way you are doing it now is a pain to reply to easily.

I don't know how to use the 'Quote' function

 

 

The quote function is on the toolbar...looks like a cartoon dialogue bubble. First you highlight what you want to quote and then click on the bubble.

Or you can simply type the word QUOTE in brackets ( [ ] ) before the quote you want to respond to and then type /QUOTE in brackets after it. Note the backslash in the latter. That's just HTML.

The red is a little much. If you can't master the quote function, try bold instead.

Which is why I said a while ago that the word Antisemite is tossed about too freely. And I guarantee you, that with all the cartoons that have been published mocking Jewish leaders, there has never been the same amount of violent protest that the Mohammad cartoon sparked

WWII was a result of more than just Hitler's views. There was the economic situation, the aftermath of WWI and plenty other factors involved. But this is also why we've stated time and again that if the speech incites violence or some other form of measurable harm, it is wrong. What is the test here? The common man. If you take 10 random folks on the street and ask them if they find something offensive, and 6 out of 10 don't, it's perfectly fine. In Iran it's perfectly acceptable for Ahmadenijad to talk about Holocaust denial and the Zionist entity all he likes, since there the common person doesn't find it offensive. If you try and make that same speech in Jerusalem, the majority of folks will get offended. See the difference? A cartoon mocking Muslims won't offend anyone in Denmark aside from the Danish Muslims (somewhere between 2-4% of the population, not a majority by any stretch of the word) and some liberal bleeding hearts.
 
 
 
Unity of the state is most definitely not required for it to prosper. The only time you get complete unity of the state is in a dictatorship where there is only one acceptable opinion. Every other country in the world has division in the state.
Of course, there are countries with no division, like the PRC that are doing quite well, and there are countries like the USA: Democrats, Republicans, Tea Party, Libertarians, Liberals, Greens, etc..., and are still in a recession. But to say that division in the state leads to lack of prosperity is a bad generalization and should be avoided.

 

Fine, than you should have no problem if the other side :

 
They don't serve in the army, do reserves, work or pay taxes.

Wrong, because there is a massive difference between differing opinions and actively breaking the law. If we both pay taxes and act as proper citizens of the state, they can have whatever position they like. Once they decide they're not gonna pay taxes, but even worse, decide they're going to live off of my pocket, then by extension I should definitely have the right to say what I think about them, especially since I'm currently buying his and his children's dinner.
 
 
They do not need to actively break the law

 
They don't serve in the army, do reserves, work or pay taxes.
 

because your state allowed them these rights until now.

I guess we disagree, i would prefer keeping my tax money, instead of having the platonic satisfaction to say what I think about them

Very true, and that's something we're working hard to fix. Not all laws are perfect. It used to be legal to own trade or sell a black man in the US. Does that mean it's right?

 
I guess we disagree, i would prefer keeping my tax money, instead of having the platonic satisfaction to say what I think about them
 

I also prefer to keep my tax money, and I was arrested for protesting for that cause. But as long as they're already taking my tax money, I should at least have the moral victory to say what I like about them. Out of the two, of course I would prefer my money to stay by me.
 
 
Deniz its understandable you will find the concept of 'freedom of speech' difficult to grasp. It takes a lot of debate for it to sink in to counter what you have been conditioned to think, which was my personal experience. The cartoons were the turning point for me. Lots of heated debate online where i pretty much used similar arguments to yours but in the end saw the wisdom of those that opposed me.

 
The reality is that if we gave individuals absolute rights that is, the right to absolute freedom of speech, the right to absolute freedom of religion people are bound to abuse these rights, leading to confrontation and conflict. The State cannot afford to set the ground for such conflict in the name of freedom of speech or freedom of religion.

 

There is no such thing as an absolute 'freedom of speech'.

It's limited to incitement. You can say you hate an idea, a person, a people, a group, a religion etc but you cannot ask for them to be killed.

That is why it is not absolute and never was.

 
If we allowed unrestricted and absolute freedoms to individuals, all we would end up with is an endless supply of tit-for-tat attacks between various groups. A waste of human resources and a major desruption to the State.

 

Initially that might happen but eventually both sides will realise its more economical to counter whats said in word with the same. So the battle moves to the idea level instead of the physical.

What is the result ?

Maybe both cancel each other out and hopefully they come to the conclusion that ignoring the nutjobs would be a better use of their time.

The result is a more tolerant society, as counter intuitive as that may seem. Why ?

Because ppl require more to get sparked up about, they have become more resilient.

The final goal is govt should not be interfering with what ppl say provided its within the bounds of the law. A law thats is liberal enough not to restrict what is being said for spurious reasons like 'public interest' or security.
 
 
 
With respect to your example of the Scientologists in my opinion you or anyone else for that matter should not be restricted in experssing an opinon [emphasis added] on its worth. However, getting into the knoses of the individuals practicing Scientology, mocking them, trespassing on their premises, provoking them or stalking them or inciting violence against them exceeds the right to expressing an opinion. It is this excess which Governments regulate and I believe have a right to regulate.

 

No time for a long reply, but you are contradicting yourself here. You say I shouldn't be restricted in expressing an opinion. My opinion is that the story of Xenu is a fairy tale (and a bunch of other stuff I won't go into here). Some might see this as mocking. So, if I can't mock then I don't have freedom of expression.

It should not be up to me to decide whether a particular "opinion" is an opinion or an infringement of another individuals right to freedom of religion. It is up to the judiciary in that jurisdiction to decide where the limits are drawn. The judiciary is well placed to exercise discretion and balance the various conflicting rights.
 
 
It is the Saudi opinion that being a non-Muslim in one of the holy places is a punishable offense. It is the Saudi opinion that conversion from Islam to another religion is punishable by death. Do you fully support theocracies, like many Muslim countries, where being something other than Muslim is a punishable offense?
