Sgt. John Robertson 2nd, an Army mechanic at
nearby Fort Hood, is fuming about the so-called smart electric
meter his local utility has installed on the side of his
1,800-square-foot home.

Like thousands of consumers with the new meters, Robertson
suspects that the device is not as smart as advertised.

In his case, he says it is inaccurately measuring his family's
power use and driving up his bills -- some months by as much as 50
percent, to as high as $320 -- since it was installed in December.
This, he said, is despite his efforts to cut back on energy use.

"I've done two tours in Iraq, and when I come home I'm getting
ripped off by my electric meter," said Robertson, who with his
wife, Kim, is raising four children on a tight budget.

Whether he and others are indeed getting ripped off is now a
matter of national debate.

Over the past year, as utilities have installed an estimated 2
million of the new digital meters, power companies have received
plenty of complaints -- and in some states been hit by class-action
lawsuits -- most of them from consumers saying the smart meters are
overstating their electrical usage.

This is not the smooth rollout envisioned last year, when the
Obama administration included money for utilities to install smart
meters as part of a $3.4 billion injection of federal stimulus
spending to modernize the nation's power grid. By 2020, there could
be as many as 65 million smart meters, by various makers, according
to one estimate.

Using digital technology and computer networking, smart meters
can transmit real-time data that is supposed to enable utilities to
conserve electricity and better allocate power during parts of the
day when overall demand is high. Utilities can also then vary the
price for power, by time of day or time of year, based on when it
is being used; some are already offering this option to customers.

Meanwhile, for customers with the right training and additional
equipment, the meters can give households a much more detailed
picture of the amount of electricity they are using, down to
individual appliances. That, in theory, can help people reduce
their electric bills and become greener citizens.

But because of faulty technology in some cases, and more often
through general shortcomings in consumer education and
customer-service support by many utilities, smart meters are
leaving many customers dumbfounded.

In Maryland earlier this year, state regulators, aware of the
discontent around the country, temporarily blocked a utility's
smart-meter proposal, citing inadequate planning and the potential
cost to consumers.

In California, Michael Kelly, a lawyer handling a class-action
suit against the state's dominant utility, Pacific Gas and
Electric, over billing disputes, said the problems probably had
less to do with faulty devices and more to do with a hasty rollout.
Old billing systems were merged with the new smart-meter
technology, he said, too frequently resulting in erroneous charges.

"We're just saying we want an evaluation done and that we want
anyone who was overcharged to get their money back," Kelly said.

A state-ordered analysis by the independent research firm
Structure Consulting Group, released in September, agreed with the
utility's assertion that its new meters were accurate for the most
part. The study also supported its conclusion that most of the
complaints could be traced to a heat wave, changes in personal
behavior or old meters that were actually malfunctioning and
undercharging before the new ones were installed.

But the Structure report also said the utility had done a poor
job of educating consumers and addressing their concerns. In basic
terms, the smart digital meters are simply replacing the old analog
meters, with their inscrutable dials and counters, found on the
sides of homes all over America. But unlike those "dumb" devices,
which are often read once a month by utility employees going house
to house on foot, the digital meters can provide utilities with
remote, real-time measurements of kilowatt-hours being used.

A recent analysis by the nonprofit Electric Power Research
Institute, a utility-financed research organization based in Palo
Alto, Calif., estimated that creating an intelligent electricity
grid of this sort in the United States could reduce electricity use
by more than 4 percent annually by 2030. Nationally, that could
mean annual savings of roughly $20.4 billion for utilities and
their customers, according to the institute.

And consumers can benefit, smart-meter proponents say, because
they can use a variety of add-on devices of their choosing, or
online services, that allow them to view the meter's real-time data
too. The problem, some experts say, is that many smart-meter
rollout programs have simply stuck the new boxes on the sides of
homes, without fully explaining to consumers what smart meters are,
how they work and what they can do to make the most of them.

"The smart meter itself is just a relatively simple,
computerized tool that, in the end, will work just fine," said
Richard W. Caperton, a policy analyst and energy and climate expert
with the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group in
Washington. "But the customer relationship is a delicate thing,
and it needs to handled with that in mind."

In Texas last spring, a civil court judge dismissed a
class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of customers who complained
that the smart meters were overstating their electrical usage and
inflating their bills. The judge ruled that such disputes were more
properly handled by the state's public utilities commission.

Jason Berent, the lawyer behind that suit, said the commission
process was too cumbersome and unresponsive for average residential
customers.

Robertson and his wife filed their own complaints with the
commission -- to no avail. The agency ruled that the Robertsons'
smart meter was working properly, but Berent contended that the
commission's investigation was perfunctory.

On Wednesday, with Berent as their lawyer, the Robertsons filed
a civil court petition seeking information on faulty devices in
their service area. The filing is a precursor to a suit against the
device's manufacturer, Landis+Gyr. A Landis+Gyr spokesman said the
company would not comment on a matter related to litigation.

Chris Schein, a spokesman for Oncor, the company that installed
the Robertsons' smart meter, said a prolonged and unusual cold snap
last winter, when the new meters were being introduced, had caused
residents to use more power than normal. That, Schein said,
contributed to what some consumers might have perceived as problems
with the new meters.

An independent study commissioned by state regulators and
conducted by the consulting firm Navigant came to the same
conclusion. And while the Navigant analysis did uncover a few
faulty meters, the study also found that the smart devices were
actually more accurate than the ones they replaced.

Still, both Navigant and Schein suggested that better consumer
education and outreach -- and a streamlined way for dealing with
questions and concerns -- was necessary.

"We're looking at all of our processes and asking, how can we
improve things?" Schein said.

The Robertsons are not satisfied by the official explanations.

They noted that their old meter measured 829 kilowatt-hours of
electricity use in for their August-September billing cycle last
year. For the comparable period this year, they say, the smart
meter counted a more than threefold increase, to 2,772
kilowatt-hours -- despite the Robertsons' efforts to reduce their
energy use by cutting back on air-conditioning and switching to
energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs.

"If they would tell me something that made sense, I'd be fine
with it," Kim Robertson said. "But I haven't heard anything from
anyone that makes any sense."
