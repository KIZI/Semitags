Emerson to Milan

It's official. The scarred warrior is leaving for better pastures. 5
million euros, a financial net loss of some substance for Real Madrid.
At least Emerson could function as a tractor, not a brand new one, but
a tractor. Who will be in charge of making his many small fouls for
Real Madrid? Guti blows a fuse easily. Diarra is not such a fouler.
They need a gentle butcher.

I imagine Emerson is going to be a sub at Milan.

Best,

Are you saying Emerson was a crap signing for Madrid?

Once again Milan play hardball and once again Real cave-in and have to
take a loss because of the high wages they're paying. They wanted €12
million for Ronaldo and settled for €7.50 and wanted €10 million for
Emerson. I'm sure they think if they keep selling players to Milan
they'll eventually get Kaka'.

I really dislike him on account of him being a Juventino but rather him
than that son of a bitch Cannavaro. He'll be sub and useful cover for
Gattuso and Ambrosini as Brocchi clearly isn't good enough in that role.

Emerson is actually still a very good player, but to be honest,
who cares?

Far more interesting is if Ramos, the best manager in Spain, is
going to join the Premier league. That would be a story!

There is nothing intrinsically crap about most players that Real
Madrid has signed over the last 5 years or so. The problem is that a
basically good player can be declared crap by the dictatorial Madrid
press without even playing, or not playing much. This was the case
with Diogo, for example, and before, with a player like Cambiasso,
practically given away when right now, RM does not have a midfielder
of his caliber. Real Madrid doesn't know how to wait, they want
everything right now. Emerson was brought in by Capello to make a
midfield, which didn't exist until then. From watching him in the
field, I think all the years of battling hard are taking their toll
physically on the player. However, he is a good player to have when
the going gets tough, and that may be why Milan is picking him up.
They like players like that. I like them too.

Now wait for RM to give away promising and very young players like
Gago, Marcelo and Higuaín because "they are not good enough for Real
Madrid". They don't realize that they're kids, just like Cambiasso was
a kid when they brought him in and still very young when they let him
go. They didn't let him mature. Inter thinks he's good!

In summary, a club that lacks any kind of long-term policy isn't going
to have many triumphs, I don't think. Not when they're in competition
with organizations that follow basic principles, like Barcelona,
Zaragoza, Villarreal, Sevilla, Valencia and many of their European
rivals. What Capello did last year was a miracle. Had they given him
three years to build a team, the fans would have had something to hang
on to, some basic framework for evaluating hired players. Right not,
nobody knows where the new players will play, what role the club wants
them to play in the group, nobody knows who the leaders are, etc. Very
confusing situation, very unprofessional.

Yet under conditions similar to these they won three CL's.  Was it
different then?  I am not trying to contradict you, more just realising
there's something there I don't see.  Was it merely the then-president?
Were they just lucky under Heynckes (I don't believe luck can take you
to a CL championship)?  Was it, later, just Del Bosque?

Figo and Zidane.

Luck, a flower in the butt, as we say here. Football is no different
from life in general: the methodical guy beats the improviser 99% of
the time. And yes, luck can take you to a CL championship. Things like
missed penalties by your adversaries, bad calls, the luck of the draw.

And in those years that you mention, there was nothing like the
instability that we see today.

What's wrong with hiring a coach, giving him power, and letting him
work steadily? Flooding the team with players and "cleaning out the
stables" every year is not the way to go, I don't think. But you see,
it's all based on blaming the previous guy...

The funniest thing I've read recently is a letter by a Madrid fan
asking for RM to get rid of a bunch of players, among them...
Metzelder! He hasn't even played. And fans want Pepe to go, already.

Best,

This is nonsense.  The 1998 win featured neither Figo nor Zidane.

This was the lineup for the final:

Real Madrid (trainer Heynckes)
Illgner, Hierro, Sanchis, Panucci, Roberto Carlos, Raúl (Amavisca 90),
Karembeu, Seedorf, Redondo, Mijatovic (Suker 89), Morientes (Jaime 82)

Zidane still wasn't there in 2000, nor was Figo, who joined Real in
summer 2000 after this victory.

Real Madrid CF(trainer Vicente del Bosque)
1-Iker Casillas; 2-Michel Salgado (4-Fernando Hierro 84) 3-Roberto
Carlos,
18-Aitor Karanka, 3-Iván Campo, 8-Steve Mc Manaman, 6-Fernando Redondo,
11-Iván Helguera, 7-Raúl González, 19-Nicolas Anelka (5-Manuel
Sanchís 79),
9-Fernando Morientes (11-Savio Bortolini 71).

If you consider the "Galactico" era to have begun in 2000 with the
signing of Figo, and one big name added per year after (Zidane 2001,
Ronaldo 2002, Beckham 2003, Owen 2004), the whole era would have to be
considered a bit of a failure, as, since 2000, Real have won only 3
championships and one CL. Not a bad yield, but no better than the 7
years from 1994-2000 (2 CLs, 2 championships, and no obvious policy of
splurging huge fees on the highest profile players)

Conditions were not similar. That team had a certain cohesion,
a certain spirit, and had leaders like Hierro, Redondo and Raul.
They also came before the decade of the present was truly
under way, when you could still win tournaments with
flair and not just defence+hard work.

Benny submitted this idea :

 

Just like Milan 3/4 years ago constantly handing over players to
Atletico Madrid in the hope of getting an option on Torres?

Yes that seemed to be the idea.
