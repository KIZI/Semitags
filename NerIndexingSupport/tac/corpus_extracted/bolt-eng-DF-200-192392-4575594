Student loan/grants.
Have you got proof of that? I'm a uni student and by no means starving.

That would probably be because they're budgeting or their student loan is having to be stretched out to cover a lot of things.
It doesn't mean there are no rich people though.

You're not looking hard enough then. Btw no rich people at uni doesn't equal no rich people in the UK. Students don't make up the whole of the UK.

Uni students starving??? I would love to see any evidence of this in the UK. Very bizarre thread OP. Anyway, how do you know people in the street aren't rich?

Edit - just looked at your history and you have some sort of deep-rooted issue with Britain!  http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/show....php?t=1638970

Oh sorry, i didn't realise one person next door being poor was representative of the whole student population in England.

I am a student. I have adequate money (due to my student loan) to eat very well and have never once been forced to go to bed hungry due to lack of funds. All of my friends are the same.

Anyway, you are clearly trolling...

Not true. Student loan is enough to pay for food. Students parents also help. Your statements are pretty baseless. We are fortunate to live in a country like the UK.

Are you British? If not, how do you know what out parents are like? Mine are lovely and would never see me starve.

Okay... I am English, went to a state school, my parents cannot afford to "give me everything" (and i a glad about that!) and i have no idea what a RRS is.

What do you think about me?

if you parents try their best to offer you good education and living conditon
then you are lucky, if your parents spend all the money on their own then it
would be very sad

my flatmate are suffering starvation but his parents earn 60k a year and go to spain for holiday refuse to give him money for food

There you see. You don't know what i am like or what my parents are like or anything about me. So, stop making these wild generalisations about "all British people". We have rich people, we have poor people - like every other country in the world. Your country (UAE) has rich people and poor people - it has people who can't afford the basic necessities in life.

Your flatmate is a shocking case if it is true. This is not the average student. I know no one like that here. Absolutely no one.

Also, i am surprised you were educated in the US (and presumably go to uni in the UK) as your command of English is not the best.
 
 
Loan doesn't always living costs, mine doesn't even cover accommodation.

I've had to raise £1,300 myself JUST to be able to afford accommodation (on top of student loan).

Accommodation cost is £115 p/w and thats in the cheapest accommodation provided by the uni (with bills inc).

Then for food/living costs i'll have to earn through working.

I'll give you some actual facts.  http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/ 

Uk is 26th UAE is 32nd.

Don't make generalisations based on one person. Do you know anyone else like that? We are very fortunate in the UK to have high standards of living.

So, is it better for a person to work for their money or to have it gifted to them by their rich parents? Not everyone is born with a silver spoon.

I'll admit defeat then... All British people are starving, we all have horrible parents who are happy to see us starve and we all wish we lived in the UAE where everything is perfect. I am surprised you decided to came away from the heavenly UAE to study in this disgusting hellhole of a country.

I'm off to go and scavenge some food from the bins outside...
