Derrick Rose had 29 points and nine assists as the Chicago Bulls held off a late
rally by the Los Angeles Lakers for an 88-84 victory Friday night at the United
Center arena.

It was the Bulls' first win in nearly four years over the Lakers whose score was
a season low.

The Bulls hit eight three-pointers, of which Rose scored three.

Bulls Kyle Korver also connected on a trio of threes and finished with 13 points
for Chicago, who held a 26-13 edge in points off the bench.

The two-time defending National Basketball Association champion Lakers were led
by Kobe Bryant's 23 points. Bryant shot a dismal nine of 23 from the field.

The Lakers had won seven consecutive games against the Bulls since a 94-89
Chicago win in December 2006 at the United Center.
