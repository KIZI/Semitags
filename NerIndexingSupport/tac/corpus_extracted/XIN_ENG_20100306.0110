Detroit Pistons guard Rodney Stuckey, who collapsed on the bench during an NBA
game at Cleveland, was released from the Cleveland Clinic on Saturday.

All medical tests conducted at the hospital showed normal results, but Stuckey
will undergo more tests after returning home to Detroit, the Pistons announced.

Stuckey passed out into the arms of Pistons strength and conditioning coach
Arnie Kander and was kept overnight for observation after being taken off the
court on a stretcher.

The collapse was not the first medical emergency for Stuckey, who missed two
games in 2008 after complaining of dizziness and feeling lightheaded in the
second quarter of an NBA game.

Cleveland defeated Detroit 99-92 on Friday, the Cavaliers improving to an NBA-
best 49-14 while the Pistons slid to 21-41, the third-worst record in the
Eastern Conference.
