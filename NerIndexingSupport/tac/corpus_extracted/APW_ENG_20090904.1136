A judge in the Dominican Republic has sentenced a Chilean and an Argentine to three months in jail for the theft of about $19,000 and two pairs of shoes from the manager of a renowned French pianist.

William Ignacio Diaz, of Chile, and Cesar Antonio Santilla, of Argentina, were sentenced to three months in prison while their case is reviewed. Both are 36 years old.

Police say Diaz went to a hotel in Santo Domingo and claimed he lost the key to the room where a manager for pianist Richard Clayderman was staying. Authorities say Diaz also stole three credit cards.

Police did not say what role Santilla allegedly played in the theft.

The men were sentenced Friday.
