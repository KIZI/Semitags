Jason Castro was a breath of fresh air during "American Idol's"
seventh season, a bit of a revelation before the show was overrun
with Jason Mraz-y singer-songwriters.

His run was eventually marred by a lack of experience and a
struggle to stay within the parameters of odd-fitting themes.
(Mariah Carey week did him no favors.) Freed from those silly
constraints, Castro proves an appealing, adept artist on his
self-titled debut album, online and in stores this week.

There's spirit in his voice, and the songs crackle with energy.
It's exactly the type of record you'd expect from the dreadlocked
Aggie -- and a nice surprise at the same time. (Castro grew up in
Rowlett, Texas, just outside Dallas.) Sunlight seems to stream from
the CD case.

Castro's vibe was often sleepy on "Idol," but nothing here
suggests the singsong-slumber he eventually lapsed into near the
end of his run. (It's also the type of record Season 8 winner Kris
Allen probably should have made.) There are flickers of country,
soul, pop and folk (of course) throughout the lean, eight-track
effort. (A special amazon.com edition includes six bonus tracks.)

Producer Eric Rosse (Sara Bareilles, Tori Amos) wraps Castro in
a slick sheen that still allows room for his wry personality.
"Let's Just Fall in Love Again" breezes by on a swirl of whistles
and drums; and "That's What I'm Here For" is downright
irresistible, like Green Day by way of the Plain White T's
(seriously).

"Love Uncompromised" amps up the rock edge with a bit more
electric guitar, and "You Can Always Come Home" finds Castro
sharing the swoon with Canadian singer Serena Ryder. The disc also
includes his gorgeous reading of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah,"
recast here with a bit more maturity than his solid reading on
"Idol."

Every song here, in fact -- "This Heart of Mine," unabashedly
sweet "It Matters to Me," should-be-a-summer-anthem "Closer" --
is effortless. Castro manages to stay true to the sound he mined on
"Idol" while still establishing a unique musical identity.

Given the TV talent show's track record with post-show albums,
that in itself is a small miracle.
