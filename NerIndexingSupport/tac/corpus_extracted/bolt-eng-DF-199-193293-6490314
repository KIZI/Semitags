 
 
The Canada Thread
 
 
I'm starting this thread, because shockingly.. there isn't one already. Or if there is, I couldn't find it. Regardless, this is a place to put all the stuff, jokes, cartoons, funny stories, whatever it may be.
I'll start it with this youtube funny. I put it on another thread, but I think it belongs here.

Feel free to add anything you like.

@Ceili,

 
An American decided to write a book about famous churches around the world. For his first chapter he decided to write about American churches. So he bought a plane ticket and took a trip to Orlando, thinking that he would work his way across the country from South to North.

On his first day he was inside a church taking photographs when he noticed a golden telephone mounted on the wall with a sign that read $10,000 per call". The American, being intrigued, asked a priest who was strolling by what the telephone was used for. The priest replied that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 you could talk to God. The American thanked the priest and went along his way.

Next stop was in Atlanta. There, at a very large cathedral, he saw the same golden telephone with the same sign under it. He wondered if this was the same kind of telephone he saw in Orlando and he asked a nearby nun what its purpose was. She told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 he could talk to God. "O.K., thank you," said the American. He then traveled to Indianapolis, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. In every church he saw the same golden telephone with the same "$10,000 per call" sign under it.

The American, upon leaving Vermont saw a sign for Canada and decided to see if Canadians had the same phone. He arrived in OTTAWA, and again, there was the same golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read "10 cents per call." The American was surprised so he asked the priest about the sign. "Father, I've traveled all over America and I've seen this same golden telephone in many churches. I'm told that it is a direct line to Heaven, but in every state the price was $10,000 per call. Why is it so cheap here?"

The priest smiled and answered, "You're in Canada now son, it's a local call".

 

 
 
 
@hamburgboy,

When I heard that joke the first time, the location was Israel, not Canada. But it's still a good story, eh?
 
 
@Ceili,

do y'all still have Randy Quaid...?
 
 
@Rockhead,

Yeah, I haven't heard much about him lately. Once his wife figured out she was part Canuck, he got his entrance papers and he's been pretty quiet. Mind you, I'm not in the loop, so who knows?
 
 
@Ceili,

My only question is about gardening. Is it possible to grow a tomato in the open garden in Canada? Every time wed be up there at a restaurant, the salads always tasted like the tomatoes were greenhouse grown and had all the flavor of wood pulp.

Years ago, I worked in the kitchen at the Hotel Frontenac and made salads. We had several dozen boxes of tomatoes that were separately picked and packed and boxed with tissue and placed in defined cubbies. These were all grown in New Jersey or Maryland.

Id think GM would have caught up with tomato husbandry. You could add the antifreeze genes of blueberries to the tomato and have a short season better tasting local crop.
 
 
@Ceili,

Gordon Lightfoot still around?
 
 
@farmerman,

Parts of Canada are south of the northern parts of the "lower 48." In those areas, you do have truck gardening. The problem is, their production is not sufficient to meet the demand for fresh fruit and vegetables of the entire country. Many of the things grown in southern Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia--such as tomatoes--are offered as premium products, at a higher price. You can find "grown in Canada" products in the produce sections of stores, but you're not going to find them sold in food service quatities to large consumers such as the Hotel Frontenac. Why should such places pay those higher prices? Why should the people who run the truck garden pass up the opportunity to get their better price?
 
 
@Setanta,

When driving through Ontario to Toronto I noticed a large wine-growing area. Can we assume that Canadian wine must be prevalent? Certainly apples and maple syrup are abundant, too.
 
 
@farmerman,

As a Lightfoot fan, yeah, he's around but he really a shadow of his former greatness. Unfortunately, in 2002 underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, from which he had additional surgery in 2003. in 2006 he had a minor stroke which affected his guitar-playing. Fortunately, he rehabed from that. In 2011 he was still touring but limited. I've heard his voice and it's recognizable. His music I still play and it still gives me chills.
 
 
@Ragman,

There is a large wine growing industry in Ontario. I don't know if this is the case elsewhere, but i suspect that it is.

EDIT:  According to this web stite , there are more than 700 wineries in Canada.
 
 
@Setanta,

yeah..when I saw the massive orchards/vineyards I was impressed. There was lots of official signage there that indicated it was a very serious effort.

I just saw this great link about CN wine-growing efforts:

 http://www.winesofcanada.com/bobs_view.html 
 
 
Yep, the Okanagan region, among others, of BC is famed here for its wineries. We can and do also grow tomatoes and other veggies and fruits which are generally sold at roadside stands and farmers' markets.
 
 
I've had Canadian wine produced in the Niagara area.
Also "ice wine", which was a bit sweet for my taste.
 
 
@George,

yeah. upstate NY and the area is rife with sweet winesd and white wines. It makes sense that thiose grapes do well in that climate. Thinking of that geographical Niagra area with its reputation for champagne-sparkling wine from upstate and Finger Lakes of NY.

However, what I'm surprised about is CN effort on the 'serious' red wines - that is a whole other kettle of fish. I believe they're making inroads on that too. Climatologically and know-how that is a surprise to me.
 
 
@George,

I think a lot of the Niagara penninsula wineries concentrate on ice wines because it's "easy" for them. If you can find a feed, either from CBC's web site, or on Sirius Satellite Radio, CBC does a wine show on the last friday of every month. I'll go get a link.
 
 
The program is called Ontario Today, it airs from Noon to 1:00 p.m. EST, and on the last Friday of each month, Konrad Ejbich does a show on wine, including call-ins, and in which he frequently touts Canadian wines. You can go to the CBC Radio One web site to look for archived progarmming, or you can search specifically for Ontario Today. CBC Radio One is broadcast on Sirius Satellite Radio Channel 159.
 
 
@Mame,

What about cherries? Aren't they also marketable there. After all WA state is huge area for growing..and it's not far from that climate-wise.
 
 
@Ragman,

In season, you can get cherries in Ontario. Probably other areas of the country as well.

One of the up and coming big deals is honey. One of the world's leading apiarists is at the University of Guelph. They run a terrific apiary program there. They recently inherited a Belgian monk's beehives. He had been selecting for gentle bees for many decades. They have his bee colonies on an isolated island a couple of hours drive north of Toronto.

Quebec is deservedly famous for its unpasteurized cheeses. cavfancier turned me on to them. Incredible.
 
 
@George,

The wines and hard ciders from Prince Edward County have created strong competition for the Niagara Region and B. C. wines in some categories. Some interesting microbreweries have also developed in the county.

At one of the cheese caves there, they do beer and cheese pairings that are wonderful. The whole terroir concept makes sense once you've had the chance to do some sampling.
 
 
@Setanta,

Actually Ive been referring to the "tomatoes" grown in the maritimes (especially NS's Annapolis Valley). I was never impressed by the tomatoes they grew.
The Labrador effect on the MAritimes, and the Gulf STream on Ireland is why Ireland can grow palm trees, even though its at the same lat as Labrador
 
 
@Ragman,

Niagara wineries in NY have always reminded me of Manaschewitz Concord Grape wines. SHit that hurt your teeth when ya drank it.
You could put a lot of the NY wines on pancakes
 
 
@farmerman,

As I reacll from my past imbibition, Canadian wines were not very high in alcohol. When you are weaned on eoither French or Calif dry wines, you demand the 12+% alcohol for the Bordeaux's and up to 16% for Burgundies.
I remember one called Chateau Gai (not that theres anything wrong with that). It just lcked a zing and a kick that the alcohol jams in there.
I suppose the wine production of Canada has been maturing in the past 15 years since I quit. So they probably produce some good (meaning dry) wines and ciders.
 
 
@farmerman,

Yes. Every year I grow a good dozen or so plants. My dad, on the other hand, grows about 100. Were not Italian either...
In Edmonton, we have a short growing season but have 15 hours of sunshine or more per day. I believe this is one of the sunniest places on earth. Believe it or not. That being said, we have at least 4 wine growing regions in Canada, not in AB mind you, but you can grow grapes here as well.
However, due to the long and usually brutal winters, and the rather delicate nature of tomatoes... Sadly, all we are left with is imported or green house tomatoes.
Also, most restaurants haven't the gumption to search out better sources than the big suppliers, so we, as consumers, are S.O.L. Even in the summer.
 
 
@farmerman,

Yes. Gordon just did a Canadian tour for his 73 birthday. I was hoping to go, but a friend got married on the same day...
 
 
@farmerman,

oh yeah. And from Finger Lakes and Lake Niagra and Canandaigua lakes area (Widmer fruit) wines. Oh so sweeeet! I recall HATING those even at a callow 22 years of age when sweet wines like Boone's Farm fruit wines were so popular.

Now there is a far different statement to make about upstate NY champagne-sparkling wines. NY state sells a lot of it and they are fairly to very good and not pricey for the most part.
 
 
Ooops, guess I should have read thread first.
There are wineries on Vancouver Island, in and around Vancouver proper, B.C's interior - Okanagan - Naramata Bench, Ontario's Niagara region, Quebec and Nova Scotia.
Canada produces the most ice wine in the world and was the first to do so on a commercial basis. It is made in Ontario and BC.
Canada is also big on fruit wines and ciders, which are becoming more and more popular.
The first vines in BC were planted in the early 60's. Since then, it has almost replaced the typical orchards. Almost...
Canada produced many award winning wines, that can compete with the world's best. Unfortunately, we are not yet known for this (except icewine) and you'd be hard pressed to find any product even in the bordering states. Forget Europe or beyond.. Due to antiquated alcohol laws, it's difficult to find BC wines in Ontario, or Alberta etc and vice versa, unless the company has the money behind it to get a big contract. A citizen of Alberta that buys and then crosses the provincial border can be charged with bootlegging. Not likely, but like beer 20 years ago, each province had a tight hold on their own output, to the detriment of all the potential buyers and sellers.

I've visited wineries all over this country. The idea that Canadian wines are tooth decayingly sweet is a memory from a burgeoning industry. No longer!!
Recently, I was listening to an Italian wine guru.. he travels the world helping (for a huge price) wineries make stellar vintages. He was very impressed with the terroir in the Okanagan. He said the only problem he could see with our wines, is that instead of concentrating on a few and doing them well, there is a lot of experimenting with grapes here. Of course, this is the only way to find the right fit. It takes a good decade or so, for the vines to begin to get acclimatized or to know if they suit the soil etc.. This experimentation could take a few more decades before we try not to grow it all and figure out what is the best grape per area. We're young, unlike France or Italy who've done all there experimentation for hundreds of years, a millenia more likely, and know must follow the letter of the law and only grow specific grapes per specific terroir.
Plus, as the earth is heating up, California may have already started losing the ability to grow certain grapes. Who knows, the next great zinfandel maybe a Canadian blend...
 
 
@Ceili,

Thanks for helping enlightening a wine-lover and wine fan.
 
 
If we ever get to Toronto, I'm heading straight for this bookstore. It's magical

@Ragman,

My pleasure..
 
 
@Irishk,

Oh, now I have to search for it as well. Brilliant bit of stop action there, or magic..
 
 
@Ceili,

Here's an except from a Canadian wine website that describes their wines and specialities:

Grape Varieties and Wine Styles (grown in Canada)

"Canadian wines are made as either single-varietal wines from one grape variety, or as a blend from two or more grape varieties. The following grape varieties are commonly used to produce the wide array of wine styles currently available in Canada, ranging from dry and off-dry table wines to sweet late harvest dessert wines, of which Icewine is the best known and most extraordinary of all.

Ontario Rieslings were the first to show their potential for excellence. Producing long-lived, crisp and elegant wines in all styles, from dry and off-dry table wines characterized by bright citrus notes of lime and grapefruit, to honeyed, late harvest dessert styles including nutty Botrytis Affected late harvest wines and the rarest of late harvest, Icewine.

Icewine is the sweet, luscious and intensely flavoured dessert wine made from grapes that have frozen on the vine. Canadian Icewines are produced in both Ontario and British Columbia, with most being made from the thick-skinned white grape varieties Vidal or Riesling. Icewines cannot be harvested until the temperature reaches at least -8 to -10 Celsius, which means the usual harvest time can be as late as December or January. The grapes are picked by hand and pressed when nearly frozen solid, resulting in only the smallest quantities of juice with highly concentrated natural sugars and acidity. Within each frozen grape are the flavours of the tropics: pineapple, guava, passion fruit and mango.

Late harvest wines from the french hybrid, Vidal, are also capable of producing voluptuous late harvest and Icewine redolent of honeysuckle, peach, hazelnut and pear. Riesling is also the base wine for several Canadian sparkling wines made in both the traditional method and Cuve Close.

Canadian Chardonnays are noted for their well-formed structure supported by natural acidity and ripe fruit, underlain by a balanced use of either French or American oak. Other styles include crisp, un-oaked versions, creamy Sur Lies, and sparkling wines.

In BC, Pinot Blanc has been particularly successful with grip and flavour, and spicy Pinot Gris with depth and complexity. Other whites that have produced intriguing wines in BC include Ehrenfelser, Auxerrois, Semillon, Chenin Blanc and Bacchus.

Both Ontario and BC are producing bordeaux-type or other blends of white wines with elegant floral and spicy notes, some with tropical fruit and citrus flavours.

Some of the finest expressions of Gamay Noir are emerging from Ontario — deeply extracted, with ripe red-berry fruit, aged in French oak. Although some are made in the more common early drinking Beaujolais-style, using carbonic maceration, the excitement lies in the fuller-bodied versions, which in many cases, are comparable to the finest Classic Beaujolais Crus.

Pinot Noir continues to hold great promise in Niagara, sufficient to prompt the largest producer in Burgundy (Boisset) to partner with Vincor, Canada’s largest producer, to build a winery in Niagara, Le Clos Jordan, that will be dedicated to Pinot Noir and Burgundy’s white variety, Chardonnay.

Although Cabernet Franc is better known as the blending partner to Cabernet Sauvignon, it is being successfully showcased in Canada as a varietal wine in its own right. Canadian Cabernet Franc ranges from lighter versions of raspberry and spice, to rich, dense, age-worthy styles of chocolate and cassis. Cabernet Sauvignon has shown itself to be increasingly successful in Canadian conditions, and is producing complex full-bodied wines on its own or in bordeaux blends known as Meritage.

Performing well in the southern Okanagan Valley of British Columbia are the Bordeaux trio of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Merlot, in particular, has shown great promise with velvety wines redolent of plum and cassis, and is the top red varietal grown in British Columbia."
 
 
Just returned from Vancouver. What a treat that city is.
Enjoyed some good Okanagan wines
 
 
@Ceili,

Even though I abstain, Ive tasted some of the recent hard ciders they produce in Vt and Quebec. They are damn good and I wish I could handle it without blowing out all my meds.
Hmm, drink but die smiling or continue this mortal coil without an occasional Puligny Montrachet. Hard choice.
 
 
@farmerman,

Ceili, tomatoes are an entire nother thing. I think that Genetic Messing can develop a tomato that is ideal for short seasons of longduration intense daylight. I sncerely believe that the MNP's that define the (somewhat) frost proofing of blueberries, could be genetically implanted into tomatoes. I would just not want for any non-plant gene be inserted into a plant because we couldnt be sure about the range of expressions. (Sorta like chaos theory in which tomatoes are crossed with Arctic Stickelbacks). BUT, tomatoes and blueberries. I dont like a lot of GM stuff wherein the genome of the crop plant has been turned into an insecticide. (I used to be in favor of almost unlimited GM "doping", now Ive read up on some of the bad results) wherein plants have been favored with Bt genes and Immune -to-Roundup genes from wild carrot and shit like that. That kind of stuff is really short sighted.
 
 
@farmerman,

You can grow a ton of different varieties up here. I don't believe any of the tomatoes I grow are of the Monsanto lineage, et al. I've grown tomatoes bigger than my head, down to tiny grape like versions. I love tomatoes. Fruit of the gods..
The only thing you have to worry about is a late start on the season or an early frost. Thankfully, tomatoes have a built in mechanism to help the northern gardener, and this is the ripen up quickly off the vine, or make a great green tomato chutney.
As others have stated, there a lots of farmers markets or U-picks in almost every region. Don't base Canadian produce on the restaurants. Most of that stuff is grown in the US or even farther south and then kept in cold storage for god knows how long. I think we are sold the crap nobody else will eat. We Canuck's are perennially short on Vitamin D, the sunshine drug. We will take what we can get.    
 
 
The most common mistake people not used to northern climes make is to plant their tomatoes too early. Southern Canada, as well as Northern USA, are both subject to killing frosts well into April. When I was living at the 2,000 ft. elev. level in New Hampshire, I'd never put my tomatoes into the ground until after Memorial Day (May 30). Given a half-decent Summer, there's no reason why you shouldn't have a great crop before Labor Day. Tomatoes don't take all that long to mature on the vine.
 
 
@Ceili,

i don't think there is anything more canadian than " fuddle duddle " -
i still remember the outrage it caused in parliament - but it soon became part of " canadian-english " - but seems to have been lost.
too bad !

 
Trudeau's 'fuddle duddle' incident

Broadcast Date: Feb. 16, 1971
"The prime minister interrupted me... by mouthing a four letter obscenity," says Conservative MP John Lundrigan.
"He mouthed two words," adds another Tory MP, Lincoln Alexander, to a group of reporters. "The first started with the letter F, the second word the letter O."
The accused potty mouth, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, swears he did no such thing.

Trudeau says that Lundrigan and Alexander are being "very sensitive" for "crying to mama and to television."
When pressed by journalists on exactly what happened inside the House of Commons on Feb. 16, 1971, Trudeau mutters the soon-to-be famous phrase: "fuddle duddle."
 

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q22GJoFNW4 

       
 
 
@Irishk,

They interviewed the shop owner on the CBC this morning. It was a lovely interview.
 
 
@Ceili,

I understand what your saying about sunshine. I moved to where the warmth PLUS the so. FL sunshine was having been a native New Englander. Based upon your previous post about sunlight, I looked up the amount of sunshine you guys get. In so. and central Alberta you're at the top of the Canadian list as far as available sunhine; however, it must be mighty hard to enjoy a brisk long walk outdoors when the temp is in minus numbers. A tad disconcerting when body parts break off in the stiff prairie winds.
 
 
@hamburgboy,

I remember Tim Hortons take on the fuddle-duddle - it was a lovely eclair - still made with real cream back in the day.
 
 
@Ceili,

You guys have the best SERVICEBERRY BUSHES> I "imported" several slips in our RV engine compartment when we cleared US customs and my wife was certain I was going to Levenworth for smuggling serviceberry bushes. I was more certain that the US Border DUdes (Think postal carriers with guns) would impound my bushes and plant em in their own gardens.

I love serviceberries. They are like a cross among highbush blueberries, strawberries and a teeny bit of lemony undertaste.

We tried making pies but the berry is too delicately flavored to be used in a pie. It doesnt stand up to all the dough and junk. Maybe a serviceberry/raspberry pie.
 
 
@Ceili,

OOOH, the tomatoes that were "
Bigger than your head" were they a Siberian tomato varietal? The Russians had developed a huuge tomato with skin as thick as an inner tube. My aunt brought some back when she last went to Moscow. She gave me a bunch and I had them for several years of seed saving, then one year he plants died off from some kind of fungus.
The really big ones are thick skinned, pink, and verrry meety. No shit, 3 of them will make most of a big pot of sauce.
 
 
@Ragman,

You get used to it. The winter months are dark, maybe eight hours of daylight or so, it's the summer where we get spoiled. Thus the lack of Vitamin D...
Everytime I go south, I forget that you all get less sunshine, that your days are shorter. I tend to make plans and then realize to late that there won't be enough light... oh well.
This winter we've been spoiled too. The rest of Canada not so much. I had grass growing in my yard yesterday, mid january - WHAT??. Today, mother nature is blowing hard and all those tender shoots are frozen solid. For some odd reason, maybe global warming, we've had weeks and weeks of above zero Celsius weather. Unbefreakin'believable. My dad, who has lived here since the mid 50's has never seen anything like it. The farmers almanac said this winter would be even more brutal than the last. How wrong they were. So now, even if it does plunge to the -40's, it will be the shortest winter on record. No complaints here...

As for brisk walks, my two dogs drag me, rather quickly.. I keep warm, it's the wind I hate. The wind chill will kill ya.
 
 
I loved Trudeau. I was a kid but I thought he was the next best thing to a rock god.. lol
Fuddle duddle indeed. That man had a way with words.
I don't think Timmy's had made it out west in time for us to enjoy the eclair. When I was a kid we didn't have donut shops out here, that was an eastern thing, it's only in the last 10-15 years that they became de rigueur. I still find it odd how quickly it became a normalcy out here.
 
 
@farmerman,

I've never heard of service berries. "Round here, it's Saskatoons or Huckleberries. In the more mountainous regions, you'll find the tiny wild strawberry and on the coast the big salmon berries and wild blackberry brambles that would swallow Vancouver whole if they had the chance.

As for the tomato, I think it was just a plain ol beefsteak. There are people that grow all kinds of heirloom and hybrids. I generally get what I can from my dad or the local greenhouses. He's a little more on the uptake, at least when it comes to giving the seedlings an early start.
 
 
@Ceili,

I remember the donut shops in Winnipeg back in 1977 - 79. Best hot chocolate. Robins Donuts were big in the "near north" in those days.
 
 
@Ceili,

Oh good.
A Canada thread!
Good on you for starting it, Ceili!

Lots of things that really interest me about Canada, so I will stay turned to see what you guys talk about....

One of the "things Canada" that I really like is CBC radio. (I love good radio.)
It's great!
As I discovered when, on a few occasions, Canadian A2Kers sent me links to podcasts of CBC programs they thought might interest me.
They did. And each time I ending up checking out other available podcasts, too. Some terrific stuff was found.

I haven't explored CBC radio for ages now & this thread reminded me to do it again this morning.
Quite a list of podcast to explore later I see, including around 10 of these:

 
The Bottom Line from CBC Radio:
The Bottom Line with David Suzuki explores the disconnect between our modern values and our relationship with the Earth.
It is a celebration of our biological makeup that dictates our most basic human needs, the real bottom line.
 

Any other recommendations?

I still haven't figured out how to listen to CBC radio live. But one of these days I will, if it's possible.

-
 
 
@ehBeth,

Surprisingly, there are a couple of dozen Robin's Donuts locations still here, Beth. Tim's hasn't driven them all out of business.
 
 
@msolga,

That's funny. I was thinking about this thread on my streetcar ride tonight and thought that I'd love to say something about CBC radio (and decided against it).

It is available live streaming online. You just have to decide which CBC network you want to listen to, and which time zone you initially want to try to follow.

 http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ 

CBC1 is news and more

CBC2 is music and more

CBC3 is the sort of more alternative music stream.

I'm CBC1 all the way. I love radio documentaries, radio dramas etc. News and more.

The book I'm reading now is by a former CBC radio reader.

 http://www.elizabethhay.com/?book=late-nights-on-air 

I've always felt that the CBC is part of what makes Canada what it is. I don't feel right if I don't know where CBC1 is - wherever I am. Over the decades I have shared so many experiences with people about where we were when we heard particular voices, songs, stories on the CBC. If they're CBC listeners, they can't be strangers.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Very, very true. My mom used to have it on all the time when I was a kid. She has said it helped her begin to feel like a Canadian. I listen to it almost exclusively. I loved that it was on Sirius when I drove out east this year. I've found that it has helped me understand this vast country and the unique problems and/or lives of the listeners. There were too many interesting stories over the years to count, but I feel there is a bond between us all because of the station.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Ha, ehBeth!
Two great minds think alike!  

I will check out the live streaming link you provided, now.
(I tried before, from the CBC "official"site, with no success.)
Thanks!

ps... I think I'm definitely a CBC1 person, too.
 
 
@msolga,

 
I will check out the live streaming link you provided, now.
(I tried before, from the CBC "official"site, with no success.)
 

Same problem as before.
Not to worry, though.
Enough great podcasts to keep me happy for at least a few years!  
 
 
@msolga,

harrumph

we'll have to figure out the service hamburgboy uses - he has some kind of online radio service (free) that we used to listen to the CBC when we visited him a couple of weeks ago
 
 
@ehBeth,

Thanks for trying, anyway, EhBeth.
Much appreciated.
 
 
I have one of those "Internet radios" where you can store URLs to radio stations (And tv stations) from all over. Anyplace that has a "Live feed" website, cant hide from my radio.
I love listening to CBC. It entertainment for adults and even though it is themed, it isnt as stupid as all the right wing crap or "all news all the time" or "Country rap".

I listen to two Maritime stations (Frederick NB and St John NB). I especially love MAritime Noon and the "Fishing Reports".
I was an early devotee of PEter Gzosky(sp) and "basic Black" and my all time favorite "Dead Dog Cafe".
The humor shows are a great treat and an intermezzo from heavier news.
But I see that the Cod are returning and now they are seeking to start up a new fishery on Georges BAnk and Gulf of MAine..

_________________________
Some of my fav geology spots are in the Maritimes.
Red Head at Lower Economy NS has some of the neatest crossbedded sandstones
Columnar basalts at Scots Bay NS andBrier Island
The fossil and amethyst locations near PArrsboro and CApe Blomedan (NS or NB?? I forget which)
Cape Hopewell NB
The fossiliferous coal underbeds near Harveys Station NB ( dont be intimidated by the moose, In the summer they are just like cows)
Mabou Gypsum Mines at Mabou MinesNS
The heavy phenocrysts of the edges of the Shield (The Grenville Precisiely) atGaspe Q and a teeny outcrop at the tip of Bras D'Or NS (Cape Blair[I think])
The extreme (ptygmatic)folds at Chevarie Beach NS.

Ive been to Lake Louise and Bannf and like. THose kinds of grandeur are overwhelming, whereas the MAritime scenery allows us to isolate the components of the scenery and really see..
The US Appalachians are a lesson plan that must be explained with lots of interpretation. But all these above sites in Canada, especially at Chevarie, my students have always "Gotten it" when we talk about platform deformation and landmass collisions.
And the foods pretty good too.(Except for that hot spackle they call Poutine)
 
 
@farmerman,

Ah, another CBC radio fan.
See, we're not alone, ehBeth!

@msolga,

msolga,
this link should connect you to the various CBC broadcasts ( radio and tv ).
it may take up to a minute - or perhaps a double-click - to get a connection.
let us know if it works.

i've thought of getting a internet radio but not all users are happy with them - apparently the setup is a bit complicated - but once it's set up it seems to work fine.

I have a C Crane radio. It works just fine in our wireless network house. When I hook up a dipole, I can receive signals in my barn and outbuildings
 
 
I wonder if you can listen live only in Canada? I couldn't get any of the links to broadcast live - but could hear some recorded talks, etc.

I know that some ABC programmes from here can't be heard overseas.

I had the same problem, margo.

msolga,
no trouble at all - i have a lot ( too many !!! ) of links under " favourites ".
the sound quality on my laptop is not very good, so some overseas broadcasts and also youtube videos have poor quality.
eheth has suggested that i buy some auxiliary speakers to boost the sound output - just haven't done it.
on my old computer the sound was certainly better - but the speakers were pretty substantial.

Canada anti-terror barrier 'foiled by mussels'

Halifax is home to the Navy's Atlantic fleet.

A floating barrier designed to prevent a Canadian harbour from terror attacks has been removed because mussels and kelp weighed it down, it is reported.

The company that installed the 1.6km (1m) fence to protect navy ships in Halifax harbour confirmed it had been dismantled, CBC News said.

A Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) spokesman said the barrier had been removed for scheduled maintenance.

Installed in 2007, the project cost an estimated C$3.5m (£2.2m).

The fence, designed to foil small boats carrying explosives towards the Royal Canadian Navy ships docked in the harbour, was also hurt by tough waves.

"It's definitely a tricky spot," Dennis Smith, chief executive of a US company that installs similar fences, told CBC. "It's just constant 24/7, 365 pounding of the product."

Halifax is the home of the RCN's Atlantic fleet, from where HMCS Charlottetown recently departed for a six-month Nato counter-terrorism mission in the Mediterranean.

@ehBeth,

msolga, there is absolutely no rhyme or reason here, post away. Anything you like.

A country full of scouts.. ha ha ha love it!!

I once heard Robert Kennedy Jr. describe the difference between Canadians and Americans. He said, a Canadian will pull up to a set of lights at 3 am, stop and wait for the light to change, even if the road, intersection is completely deserted. We are awfully lawful aren't we.. lol
 
 
Where else can you buy a bag of homo milk?
 
 
@ehBeth,

We were entering the subway station under some high rise office buildings in downtown t.o., and the chair at the barrier was empty--apparently, the TTC employee had had to use the bathroom, or was just taking a break. People going through the barrier were putting the tokens in the hopper, or flashing their metro passes at an empty chair. In New York, word would have spread quickly and the entry way would have been choked with people looking to get a free subway ride.
 
 
@Setanta,

How many Canadians does it take to change a lightbulb?

At least 3 or 4. One to screw in the new bulb, the others to go around apologizing to everbody about the brief period of darkness.
 
 
if this is " The Canada Thread " we might want to remember that this is good old john's birthday !

 

 
Sir John Alexander Macdonald, GCB, KCMG, PC, PC (Can), QC (11 January 1815 – 6 June 1891) was the first Prime Minister of Canada. The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, his political career spanned almost half a century. Macdonald served 19 years as Canadian Prime Minister; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer.

Macdonald was born in Scotland; when he was a boy his family emigrated to Kingston, Upper Canada (today in eastern Ontario). He articled with a local lawyer, who died before Macdonald qualified, and Macdonald opened his own practice, although not yet entitled to do so. He was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which enabled him to seek and obtain a legislative seat in 1844. He served in the legislature of the colonial Province of Canada and by 1857 had become premier under the colony's unstable political system.

When in 1864 no party proved capable of governing for long, Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival, George Brown, that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform. Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences, which resulted in the British North America Act and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867.

Macdonald was designated as the first Prime Minister of the new nation, and served in that capacity for most of the remainder of his life, losing office for five years in the 1870s over the Pacific Scandal (bribery in the financing of the Canadian Pacific Railway). After regaining his position, he saw the railroad through to completion in 1885, a means of transportation and freight conveyance that helped unite Canada as one nation. Macdonald is credited with creating a Canadian Confederation despite many obstacles, and expanding what was a relatively small colony to cover the northern half of North America. By the time of his death in 1891, Canada had secured most of the territory it occupies today.

 
 
 
Thanks Hamburger.. and a very belated happy birthday to Sir John A...
I wonder if he actually ever took the train out west?
 
 
It's a bit more than 40 years ago that the last Canadian troops left our district (and state).
And since November 1970, we were unable here to listen to the best radio program until then: “ At 87.8 on the FM-dial, this is Canadian Forces Radio CAE in Werl, Germany… ”
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

I think you're wrong Walter, then again, I'm not sure where you live. I had friends stationed in Baden Baden less than 20yrs ago. My friend's son was born on the base. I remember sending her boxes of baby clothes because she couldn't afford the prices in Germany.
 
 
@Ceili,

I'm not wrong, since "our" Canadians moved to Lahr/Black Forest (and Baden-Baden region)  

Fort MacLeod, Fort Chambly, Fort Anne, Fort Prince of Wales, Fort Beausejour, Fort Henry, Fort St Loius, Fort Qu'Appelle, Fort York andFort Victoria were closed in 1971/1972 respectively taken over by British (and Belgian) troops.

 
Following the departure of 4CMBG to Lahr in 1971 the majority of the Canadian Forts/Barracks were occupied by elements of the newly arrived 3rd (UK) Armoured Division, and 6 Armoured Brigade in particular, following the restructuring of 1st (British) Corps.

@Walter Hinteler,

Ok. I didn't realize we had more than one base. I learn something everyday.. thanks.
 
 
@Ceili,

Actually the base in Baden-Söllingen was rather small, compared to that in Lahr. But Lahr only became large, because troops from  here  were send there.
 
 
@Ceili,

Baden Baden is the one (usually the only one) most Canajuns know about. Not sure why, but who cares eh  
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

I always thought Lahr was an American base.
 
 
@ehBeth,

 
Baden Baden is the one (usually the only one) most Canajuns know about. Not sure why, but who cares eh  

 

I care! And it has been called "CFB Baden-Soellingen", and during the last years of its existence it just was a detachment of CFB Lahr...  
 
 
@Ceili,

 
I always thought Lahr was an American base.

 

It was in the French Zone - thus, two wings of No.1 Air Division were stationed in France as well
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

Are there any foreign bases in Germany now?
 
 
@Ceili,

We've got here still quite a lot of British garrisons - though they will leave Germany completely until 2020. (About 60,000 personal now.)
Then, we've the Dutch here - they are engaged now (since, maybe ten years) in a combined German-Dutch Corps.

In the former American Zone, there are still about (less than) 100,000 personal.

The French still have less than 3,000 personal here.

There are no Russians bases since 1990/1991.

The Belgians left 1995 (in our district town, there was the largest Belgian grammarschool besides two in Bruxelles!).
 
 
@Ceili,

ceili,
don't know if john a. ever took the train out west, but he sure didn't like the liberals :

 
he responded to his opponent's query of his drunkenness with "It goes to show that I would rather have a drunk Conservative than a sober Liberal.".
 

btw. pierre berton's story about the canadian railway likely has info about that.
it's a rather large book - as most of his books are.

As long as they are there - generally 'yes', I think.

It only really gets worse, when they've left... because then, you've got "suddenly" hundreds of old, run-down houses, barracks and barrack grounds, you don't know what to with...

Sorry World.
We messed up.

We know you look to us as one of the last great strongholds of common sense in a swirling sea of crazy on this big ol’ crazy planet of ours.

Decriminalized marijuana, same-sex marriage, our peace keeping force, universal health care, education, our stance on environment, human rights, and religious freedom made us looked pretty darn awesome.

Now we're realizing that those things that made us awesome are being taken away from us, and it's not just us Canadians who are paying the price.

Turns out some of us thought it would be a grand idea to put this fucking guy in charge.

 

Well, actually, it wasn’t so much that we put him in charge as it is we failed not to.

We goofed. We took our stick off the ice. We pulled a real boner. For that we apologize.

But, hey. 2015 is just around the corner. Hopefully, we’ve learned our lesson, and we’ll do better next time.
 
 
 http://unicornbooty.com/blog/2012/01/12/canadian-govt-dissolves-thousands-of-same-sex-marriages-including-dan-savages/ 
Thousands of LGBT couples across the world awoke this morning to learn that they are no longer married.
A Department of Justice lawyer under Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative Party of Canada government has nullified all same-sex marriages performed in Canada in which the couples’ native country does not permit gays and lesbians to marry.
The reversal of federal policy is revealed in a document filed in a Toronto test case launched recently by a lesbian couple seeking a divorce. Wed in Toronto in 2005, the couple have been told they cannot divorce because they were never really married – a Department of Justice lawyer says their marriage is not legal in Canada since they could not have lawfully wed in Florida or England, where the two partners reside.
The two women – professionals in the their early 30s – cannot be identified under a court order. But Martha McCarthy, a prominent Toronto lawyer who represents them, said the government’s about-face is astonishing.
“It is scandalous,” she said in an interview. “It is offensive to their dignity and human rights to suggest they weren’t married or that they have something that is a nullity.”
Ms. McCarthy, who played an instrumental role in the fight to legalize same-sex marriage, said Ontario has tried to duck the volatile test case by deferring to the federal government.
“It is appalling and outrageous that two levels of government would be taking this position without ever having raised it before, telling anybody it was an issue or doing anything pro-active about it,” she said. “All the while, they were handing out licences to perform marriages across the country to non-resident people.”

Newspapers across the world are covered in headlines about this savage and unprecedented attack on LGBT people.
Dan Savage, who wed his husband (now boyfriend) in Vancouver in 2005, weighs in:
There will be lawsuits, time and money will be wasted, oceans of ink and pixels will be spilled, before this issue—the full civil equality of gays and lesbians—winds up before the Supreme Court of Canada. I’m confident that justice will prevail—God bless the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms—but the decision to reopen this issue is going to be one massive distraction for the Canadian government.
Gays and lesbians inside and outside of Canada are going to make sure of it.
Now if you’ll excuse me I need to go wake up my husband and tell him we got divorced last night.
Critics of this attack on LGBT people have noted both online and off that if gay marriages are now without legal standing in Canada if the couple’s homeland forbids them, are Middle Eastern women living in Canada now stripped of their rights to vote, drive a car, or even show their hair? Is being gay now punishable by death in Canada if you’re from Uganda? Is blogging or criticizing your government now illegal for Egyptians living in Canada?
We can hardly believe we are reporting this. Expect massive coverage in the coming days.
How would you feel to wake up divorced by a foreign government after years of marriage?

@panzade,

Stupid really.. Isn't it? After all the Canadian government directly affects the industry and they're not all that happy to do so. The arts are not a high priority in the Harper government.
 
 
@Ceili,

They've already backed away from this position.

 http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/justice-minister-declares-all-same-sex-marriages-legal-and-valid/article2301691/?utm_medium=Feeds%3A%20RSS%2FAtom&utm_source=Home&utm_content=2301691 

 
All same sex marriages performed in Canada are legal and the law will be changed to ensure that divorce is readily available to non-residents who were married in the country, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson says.

Speaking at a Toronto luncheon Friday, Mr. Nicholson blamed the Liberal government that preceded his for not filling a “legislative gap” that has left thousands of same-sex couples in an agonizing position of being unable to divorce should they feel a need to.

 

 
The announcement appears to clear up a continuing source of controversy that erupted Thursday when The Globe and Mail reported a divorce case in Toronto where the Justice Department took the position that a same-sex marriage involving non-residents is not legal unless their home country recognizes it as such.

Mr. Nicholson raised the issue immediately after taking the podium at a Canadian Club luncheon. His statement went well beyond an assurance he gave Thursday that the government will consider legislative reform that would enable couples affected to obtain divorces.

On Friday, he expressed empathy with those caught up in the confusion and assured them that changes will be made to ensure that both their marriages and divorces are legally valid.

“The confusion and pain resulting from this gap is completely unfair to those who are affected,” Mr. Nicholson said.

The Civil Marriage Act will be changed to ensure that any marriages performed in Canada that aren't recognized in the couple's home jurisdiction will be recognized in Canada nonetheless, he said.

“This will apply to all marriages performed in Canada,” Mr. Nicholson said. “We have been clear that we have no desire to reopen this issue – both myself and the Prime Minister consider this debate to be closed.”

 
 
 
@Lustig Andrei,

 
Harper's bizarre.

 

he's kinda creepy in person

weird eyes
 
 
Good. I was mightily pissed off last night. I'd imagine they got a ton of bad press from this decision.
 
 
@Ceili,

Harper is an arrogant enough son of a bitch that i doubt that the thought of bad press affects him. I suspect that he got leagl advice that that bullshit provided a good basis for a lawsuit, so he hurried to back off. Anyone who's paid any attention over the years knows that Harper's ministers aren't free agents. He says go, and he goeth, he says stay and he sits still. It was his call from the first and the only reason i can see that arrogant bastard backing off is because of legal advice.

This is an older show, The Trailer Park boys, it's very low brow, but it does speak to a certain element.

Their new show is the Drunk and on Drugs Happy Hour. I haven't checked it out yet, I'd imagine it'll be more of the same kind of humour.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_humour 
This will give you a better idea of the history and some of the acts that are still part of the psyche. Humour is a big part of our lives. Many of the biggest comedians in Hollywood to this day are Canucks, like Seth Green. Here's a list of most of them.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_comedians

This is a guy I know pretty well, he's a pretty funny voice and a good representation of aboriginal humour.

@msolga,

Excellent. Except fpr the Daily SHow and SOuth Park, humor is presented in categories down here. Funny is funny, when black humor becomes too inside, it loses any credibility as a form. Same thing with the center of the road shit we put out thats invested more with quality control than actual humor.

Even the ENglish comedians whove come over here to wow us have sold out. Ricky Gervais used to be funny. Now he is a shill.

+10: you start to see your own breath. Vancouverites begin shivering uncontrollably
0: water freezes; construction begins on backyard hockey rinks
-10: Vancouverites weep with cold; Maritimers put on T-shirts
-15: Manitobans host the last backyard cookout with ice cream for dessert; Maritimers go camping
-25: Manitobans do up the top button
-35: Ottawans think about digging out their mitts
-50: Prairie kids start saying “Cold, eh?” and elect to stay inside for recess
-60: Vancouverites disappear; Montrealers put on overcoats; Yukoners close the bathroom window
-70: Hell freezes over and the Leafs win the Stanley Cup
 
 
Stuart McLean is not a comedian per se.. He's a master storyteller and all his stories are funny. He recently was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. His stories normally revolve around Dave and Morely and their two kids, assorted family members, neighbours, dogs and hilariously - turkeys.

That was all pretty damned funny, but the last line was hilarious. People in t.o. love the Leafs even without Lord Stanley's cup. I suspect if the Leafs ever actuaaly manage to win it, there will be a serious spike of deaths from heart attack in t.o.

@Ceili,

MCkenzie posted that "Temperature scale" for reference and I have close experience with some small restaurant in St Johns Newf. We were eating near the outer wall windows and it was foggy and maybe 45 degrees out. They had the windows wide open and everybody seemed to be ok with that. (So we hadda move close to the kitchen).

I too have been selectively listening. Im gonna file these and whoop up an MP3 for the car, they are that good. GREAT!!
Our humore is embodied in such things as "Car Talk" or certain skits in "Prairie Home Companion" although, even PHC is sometimes showing Keilors advanced age.

@Ceili,

Shawn Majumder on Canadians in America :

Ha.
That was very funny, Ceili.
As an Australian, you have no idea how much I related.

There have been moments in my o/s travels when, on discovering that there's an Australian present, people have responded with absolute delight.... sort of like they've just discovered a koala in their midst! Aw how cute, an Australian!  

Or, once once when I was waiting for a bus in England, I struck up a conversation with a very debonair Indian-English businessman....
His response when discovering I was Australian?:
" Really? But you speak English so well! No one would ever know!"  

I have this feeling that traveling Canadians & Australians might share quite a few similar experiences.
 
 
 
 
 
 
when visiting canada it might be helpful to take some lessons in the newfoundland dialect also. it's an enriching experience !

When I was up in Vancouver my sister invited me to watch the post production work on her new show "Arctic Air".
It's on CBC on Tuesday nights. I think you Canucks will enjoy it.

@panzade,

I've been watching it. Some absolutely beautiful scenery up there. I've never been that far north, one day I hope to see it for myself.
 
 
@panzade,

it's a pretty good show, the writer for Arctic Air also wrote a great aboriginal drama called North of 60

@djjd62,

Adam Beach is a hottie!!
I loved North '0' 60. I used to see a lot of the cast in the neighbourhood. I would bump into Teevee all the time at the local Max store. I haven't seen him in a while, heard he got into to some trouble.. I hope he's doing ok.

Mr. D is so very dry. Too funny!!

@farmerman,

Yummy, non?
 
 
@Ceili,

we raise lambs and I can only eat the stuff after the seasonal smell wears out of my blood. Its a fact that continued exposures to certain farm activities can generate an immune reponse and induce gagging or discomfort around your product.
I know farmers who are allergic to corn products from their seasonal work with the crop.

I love pot stickers but only the kind with pork or shlimp
 
 
@farmerman,

Know whatcha mean, fm. My father, who grew up on a farm in the old country, would absolutely not eat lamb. Pork, chicken, beef, ok. No lamb. It wasn't an allergy, just an aversion from his childhood.
 
 
@Lustig Andrei,

I was told once that the reason most N. Americans don't have a taste for lamb is because the allied forces were fed a steady diet of mutton during the war. A decent lamb chop is a far cry from tough old rubbery mutton. I don't think I'd want to indulge either if that's what I'd been fed.
Funnily enough, I know several people who grew up on chicken farms that have the same aversion to poultry. Overkill taints the taste buds...
As an aside, my husband won't eat lamb either. Because, he thinks it tastes wild, gamey. I've explained to him that sheep were the first domesticated animal. He won't budge though.
 
 
How odd... we ate mutton when i was a child, although not that often. I like mutton, lamb, i can do without.
 
 
By the way, one of my favorite canned soups is Campbell's Scotch Broth. However, on those rare occasions when i could find it at the store to purchase it, i noticed that it was always "Product of Canada." I guess there aren't enough mutton producers, or perhaps mutton lovers, in the States.
 
 
In days of old
The men were bold
The women were bored
And the sheep were nervous
 
 
@Setanta,

 
How odd... we ate mutton when i was a child, although not that often. I like mutton, lamb, i can do without.

 

Good little Ozzians were raised on lamb when I was a munchkin.

Can't stand it now....it tastes really rank and I feel ill and stink of it for days if I force any down for politeness' sake.
 
 
Others may dispute this, but i think the flavor and aroma of lamb is stronger than that of mutton.
 
 
@Setanta,

LAmb and goat kid all have a huge bank of tallow on their fell. This has to be removed lest it make me gag. However, lamb raised on grain and kept quiet (No stampeding for fun) will result in a meat that is finely flavored like veal almost.
Mutton can be cooked till the tallow is gone and its usually not prepared ina meal of the meat by itself. When I was working for Dublin, the restaurant next to my hotel would cook mutton and cabbage at any time of the day. God it was awful.

I can see, by my admission of not liking lamb too much, I will probably be kicked off the Lamb ADvisory Board.
 
 
@farmerman,

Back to Canajia. Is there a really "BEST" of the best in moose jwerky? Ive had some from NS and it tasted just ok, but this place near Fredericton NB sells these various types of moose jerky that one could have for a meal by itself.

I memmber a time a few years ago, I was over near Harveys Station walking to Macadam (fossilizing). I had a bag of jerky and a canteen. When I got back to Macadam I was stuffed and cpoiled my supper. That stuff must blow up in your stomach
 
 
@farmerman,

So... there must be Silence about the Lambs?
 
 
@farmerman,

Scotch broth depends on fatty mutton. For some reason, the English refer to this as "fat-tail sheep." They commonly ate saddle of mutton and mutton chops (the latter for breakfast!). It was a sign of affluence that they could eat meat at every meal, and the meat they ate was usually mutton.
 
 
@Setanta,

One of the "finer meated" sheep breeds is the SOuthdown, a relatively short legged stocky sheep that is usually raised to muttonhood. Its not as disagreeable as some lamb Ive had.
"Scotch broth" never had it knowingly
 
 
@farmerman,

Basically, it's a fat-rich broth with stew meat size chunks of mutton in it, carrots and perled barley. Other diced veggies to taste.
 
 
@Setanta,

I thought Scotch Broth was just broth. I don't think I've ever bought a can, though, but I think the picture just shows broth. Regardless... it can probably be anything you want.

I love lamb but I've never had mutton. I don't think I've ever seen it in a store. How does the taste differ from lamb?
 
 
@farmerman,

I'm a city girl. I know there are butchers around here that specialize in wild meat. I don't hunt, but of the friends of mine who do, the only meat they turn into jerky or pepperoni is deer meat. It's very fatty. I've never had a venison roast or steak.
At Christmas, here at the local fort, a replica of the first Hudson's bay post in the area, they offer a dinner that the first settlers would have eaten. It consists of pickled moose snout and real beaver tails. Not the Toronto pastry. I've never tried either delicacy, but the pastry is pretty damn good. I've cooked moose meat a few times when I've been given it. You have to add oil, as it's very dry. I normally get it ground up and turn it into a spaghetti sauce or make a stew. It has to simmer for a good long while though.
NFLD has more moose than humans, and I'd imagine they probably know a few things about making it palatable.
I've had bear meat too, I'm not sure what species, black or grizzly. Perhaps, because it's from the pig family and if you don't cook the living daylights out of it you can get trichinosis, or maybe because it was an older beast, I found it grisly. The natives use bear fat on their hair, it makes it shiny. It's kind of stinky though, it probably also protects them from being mauled whilst walking in the bush.
I've only ever had mutton done Jamaican style, jerked or in India with curry. They again, I'm not sure if it was goat or not.
My taste buds have been spoiled. All the meat, pork, and lamb up here is grain fed. I've tried beef in other places and you can tell the difference. Corn and hay fed animals taste like corn and hay. Ewwww!! Oddly, even though my family in Ireland raise sheep, I've never had lamb in Ireland..
 
 
Scotch broth is as Set describes, however I've never had it from a can. I've worked with a couple of Scottish chefs and they would make it a couple times a month. Again, I'm not sure if they used mutton or not. Around here, because of the big Indian/Pakistani population you see Mutton for sale, but I'm not sure if it's from a goat or sheep. The Greeks and people from the former Yugoslavia are big on lamb. When I was a kid, the Croatian family who lived across the street were swarmed by the police once. A neighbour saw what they thought was a naked kid (human) being dressed and roasted on an open spit in the backyard, and called the authorities. There was a lot of red faces when it was discovered that it was a lamb, not some weird case of witchcraft...

The version made in Canada is still sold in Canada.

Farewell is the travelogue and love story of the young aristocrat 'newspaper girl' Lady Grace Drummond-Hay and the much older Karl von Wiegand, both correspondents for the Hearst Press empire. They are both passengers aboard the LZ 127 'Graf Zeppelin', the first zeppelin in history to circumnavigate the globe in 1929.
 

amazing footage so far (I've got another hour of it to watch)
 
 
Just finished a great book about the Canuck experience; specifically, life in Winnipeg in the 60's.
It's by Randy Bachman of Guess Who fame and it's called Vinyl Tap Stories.
I understand that's the name of his radio show. Anybody heard it?
 
 
@panzade,

Set and I listen to Vinyl Tap devotedly. I usually listen to the same episode a couple of times a week. I'm a total Vinyl Tap geek - I'm subscribed to the weekly newsletter.

I'd love to get tickets to one of the shows when they're on tour. Tried last time - no luck - tickets were sold out - even when they added two shows - boooooo hooo!
 
 
@panzade,

 http://www.cbc.ca/vinyltap/ 
Yup, Vinyl Tap is on every friday night. He's always got his guitar by his side. I listen to it when I get a chance. Not sure what the schedule is on satellite. I like it, it's kinda quirky.
 
 
@ehBeth,

@ehBeth,

@Ceili,

I've got good Sudbury stories and bad Sudbury stories.

My favourite Sudbury story goes back to the summer of 1978. I was living in Tundra Bay (Thunder Bay), working on a co-op engineering work term for the Ministry of the Environment doing air and water quality monitoring (there are a thousand stories around that job). I was to go back to Waterloo for the next semester.

Plane strike! no train or bus tickets to be obtained to get back to Southern Ontario.

A friend took his old station wagon off the blocks it had been living on that summer and he drove from Waterloo to Thunder Bay (15 or 16 hours). I got in from a work trip, loaded my possessions in the old Woodie and I started driving toward Kingston (18 hours of driving).

Just before we go to Sudbury, Gourdo told me that the Woodie basically had no brakes, so I wouldn't be able to stop the vehicle at any red lights on a down slope - Sudbury is verra verra verra hilly. I had to drive through town in the right lane - and keep turning right if the light turned red (and pray we were the first vehicle in that lane when the light turned red).

We made it to Kingston, and then drove to Waterloo. Two days later, the police pulled over the Woodie and took it off the road. Unsafe to drive  
 
 
@ehBeth,

Gourdo must still hold a grudge; he voted down your post
 
 
@panzade,

I hold a grudge too - there was a pair of my favourite red socks in that vehicle when the police took it away.

Hard to believe. I remember those socks over 30 years later. Still pisses me off.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Good lord, I think I've been in that car! lol
 
 
@panzade,

One of the interesting thing about Vinyl Tap is how he organizes the material. He takes suggestions from the audience, and some aren't bad, but his own ideas are often brilliant. Sometimes its a theme in the lyrics, another time it will be the use of a particular instrument, or a recording technique. A couple of years ago, he did a series of shows on electric guitars. It got so detailed he did one entire show on Fender--the Telecaster and the Stratocaster, and their electric bases. By the way, the last name is "Back-man," not "Bock-man." He pronounces it Back-man, and think i'm safe in assuming he knows how to pronounce his own name.
 
 
@Setanta,

As in Johann Bach is how I always heard it.
There's a lot more to him than I knew. He's been associated with a lot of great rockers
 
 
@panzade,

That ain't how he says it...

His shows are full of anecdotes of those great rockers, i think you'd love it.
 
 
@Setanta,

I think you're right. My sister gave me the book for Christmas. She's a transplant.

I Make The Dough, You Get The Glory lyrics

Blazing a trail to the southern cities
From the streets of our hometown
Basement bars we played from the heart
In the company of our friends

If I write down these memories
That I have saved away
Photographs of the years that passed
Inside my little brain

You're cool and cred like Fogerty
I'm Elvis Presley in the 70's
You're Chateauneuf, I'm Yellow Label
You're the buffet I'm just the table
I'm a Ford Tempo you're a Maserati
You're the Great One, I'm Marty mcsorley
You're the Concorde, I'm economy
I make the dough but you get the glory

Big fish small pond and some cover songs
We sang along the way
We used to midnight run to the Vesta Lunch
 http://www.yelp.ca/biz/vesta-lunch-toronto 
Cheeseburgers and chocolate shakes
Once I got drunk with Jeff
I told him I was in love with you
But I love you like a brother
So at least half of it was true

You're cool and cred like Fogerty
I'm Elvis Presley in the seventies
You're Chateauneuf, I'm Yellow Label
You're the buffet I'm just the table
I'm a Dodge Sparkle, you're a Lamborghini
You're the Great One, I'm Marty mcsorley
You're the Concorde, I'm economy
I make the dough, but you get the glory

If I write down these memories
That I have saved away
Photographs of the years that passed
Inside my little brain

I'm sure it's been said in the finer print
You make me look legitimate
Heavy rotation on the CBC
Whatever in hell that really means
You're cool and cred like Fogerty
I'm Elvis Presley in the 70's
You're the Concorde I'm economy
I make the dough, but you get the glory

Both Marty McSorely and Jim Cuddy (Blue Rodeo) are in this video.
Janet May?? I'm not sure of what you speak.
The great one is Wayne Gretzky.

@ehBeth,

What is the Nunivit flag ?
 
 
@farmerman,

 

 
The flag of the Canadian territory of Nunavut consists of gold and white fields divided vertically by a red inukshuk with a blue star in the upper fly. The colours blue and gold were selected to represent the "riches of land, sea, and sky", while red is used to represent Canada as a whole. The inukshuk, which divides the flag, is a traditional stone monument used to guide travellers and to mark sacred sites. In the upper fly, the blue star represents the North Star (Niqirtsituk), an important object due to its key role as a navigational beacon, and as symbolically representing the wisdom and leadership of community elders.

Thanks guys!
After FM has his question answered I'd like to ask Canadians their reaction to the veto on the Keystone pipeline.
This is a typical take from the U.S. media:

 
The latest chapter in Canada's quest to become a full-blown oil superpower unfolded this month in a village gym on the British Columbia coast.

Here, several hundred people gathered for hearings on whether a pipeline should be laid from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific in order to deliver oil to Asia, chiefly energy-hungry China. The stakes are particularly high for the village of Kitamaat and its neighbors, because the pipeline would terminate here and a port would be built to handle 220 tankers a year and 525,000 barrels of oil a day.

But the planned Northern Gateway Pipeline is just one aspect of an epic battle over Canada's oil ambitions — a battle that already has a supporting role in the U.S. presidential election, and which will help to shape North America's future energy relationship with China.
 

Is Harper pushing a new pipeline? How do Canucks feel about becoming a player in the oil game?
 
 
@panzade,

Harper's pushing, though I don't think oil "superpower" is quite on his agenda.

I'm against all of it. Primarily against the pipeline.

I've recently been re-reading quite a bit about the Berger Inquiry of the 1970's.

I think this collection of pieces from the CBC archives is useful for an intro to the subject.

 http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/topics/295/ 

or the wikipedia shortcut

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_Valley_Pipeline_Inquiry 

I'm still not a pipeline believer.

sidenote: I recommend reading Elizabeth Hays' Late Nights on Air for a fictional take on Canada's Far North in the 1970's while the Berger Inquiry was going on, and the CBC presence in Yellowknife
 
 
@Ceili,

"The Canada Party: America, but better." Yeah, that about encapsulates it. Except you have no Pecan nuts in your pecan pies and call them "butter tarts" to cover it up.
 
 
@panzade,

People would be surprised if they actually knew how many pipelines are already in the ground. They are everywhere in cities and criss cross the N. American continent quite extensively.
These two pipelines have hit a lot of nerves, some for the good reasons and some for really dumb reasons.
A pipeline should not be put through sensitive water areas. Lazy planning on the part of the oil companies. There is no moratorium on digging, mining, pumping it. In fact there are several more areas in Sask. and N. Dakota that will soon be competing with the McMurray. There is no end in sight. Regardless of how this oil gets moved, it will be moved. Pipelines are the safest mode of transport. Not trains or trucks, these have all too commonly crashed or gone off the tracks causing all kinds of headaches. It happens all the time, everyday, in every province and state. And if you'll have noticed most roads/train tracks skirt waterways, rivers and lakes. You can build a pipeline far from water sources.
Canada is already a major player in the oil industry. We already ship our oil to more than domestic and US markets. These pipelines will do it more efficiently and at a higher rate.
Harper has very little to do with it. Unlike the States, this is very much a provincial/community/big business thing. Although, if he was anti-pipeline, he'd lose his seat in Alberta, and quite possibly lose majority he holds so dear...
I can understand the concerns of all the different groups. If it doesn't get approval one way, it will another. I'm not really a supporter, so much as I am a pragmatist.
 
 
@Ceili,

good reasoning. The entire Obama stoppel is to get the damn pipe out of the and hills and the ogallala because, unlike rivers and loakes, it would almost guarantee that a spill in a ground water recharge area would take decades, if not a century to clean up and the cost would be ouuta sight.
The guys who did the original siting for the pipeline must have had their heads up their asses for thinking that this route would even be considered.
 
 
@Thomas,

Those damn butter tarts.. they'll be the ruin of us yet.
People either love 'em or hate 'em. What blows my mind is how many people comment on them. I haven't had one in years, but for some odd reason anyone that comes here manages to find them. And that ain't necessarily easy.  
 
 
@Ceili,

Years ago we went canoeing in The water trail of Algonquin Provincial park. It was like day 3 and We were tired canoeing and were gonna camp and we floated near to this village along the portage area. In the village was a lady who had a sign out to sell "Saahveneers" (How she pronounced it). A ND----She also sold butter tarts!!. There were six of us and we bought ALL of her butter tarts for the day and thats all we had for supper, butter tarts and beer. HEAVEN!!
 
 
@farmerman,

That's pretty close to a sig line there, farmer.
 
 
Years ago, I'd heard a story in passing of a black man ship wrecked off the coast of Newfoundland only to be rescued by the local towns folk. According to the story, he awoke to find a woman trying to scrub the black off his skin. She had mistaken his skin colour for crude oil from the sunken wreck. She'd never seen a black man and he had never seen a kind white person.
Today I found out that this is not just a story, but true. Today I was able to put a name on the man and the village, and put a face on a legend.

 

Lanier Phillips, a black U.S. serviceman who has credited his 1942 rescue off Newfoundland as transforming his life, died Monday. He was 88. Phillips, who would have turned 89 on Wednesday, passed away at a military retirement home in Gulfport, Miss.

Phillips was just 18 when the U.S. ships Pollux and Truxtun went aground at a cove on Newfoundland's Burin Peninsula. The story of his rescue has been told in television and radio documentaries, and recently in the play Oil and Water.

Women who washed Phillips' black skin originally thought that his body had been covered in oil that they could not cleanse. Embraced by rescuers from the Burin Peninsula towns of St. Lawrence and Lawn, Phillips often said the experience opened his eyes to a world beyond the harsh racism he encountered in the South.

@Ceili,

That's an interesting story - thanks for sharing the link.
 
 
@Ceili,

What a great story!
 
 
@Ceili,

I also posted this on my facebook page. I found out about it because a friend of mine liked the story on another friend's page, whom I don't know. Because of Facebook's new timeline, this story from a total strangers page popped up. So, I wrote my friend a note, told her I was stealing it and passing it along.

She just wrote me back.

 
I'm glad you liked that story as well. It's close to our hearts as my mom's family participated in the rescue. My mom tells the story about how her Dad was out helping to harness and pull in the rescued men from the ocean, so when he got home he was soaked and cold. After washing up (no running water, let alone hot water back then) he called out to my Nana for clean underwear... she sheepishly told him that she'd given it all way to the poor men from the ship when she went to help. They had one of the crew stay with them aftewards and for years and years, this man's family would send a barrel of clothes to my Nana, which came in handy with 13 kids, especially after my Grandpa died leaving her a widow.
 

I had no idea. Cool.
