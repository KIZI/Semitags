MIAMI DOLPHINS
According to the Miami Herald, Bill Parcells' first decision, whether to
keep coach Cam Cameron as head coach, could eventually go down as his
most meaningful. Parcells has an aggressive personality, but nothing
about Cameron seems to suggest he would match Parcells' personality, or
his coaching style. Parcells could choose to look for a new head coach
of the team he's charged with rebuilding.
