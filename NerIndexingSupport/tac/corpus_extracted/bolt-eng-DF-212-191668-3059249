This thread is about information and discussions on economic comparisons of countries.

The first post is a list based on the nominal GDP. I excerpt only the first 50. China ranks 3rd below the US and Japan. Russia ranks 8th, Brazil ranks 10th and India ranks 12. Together they are called  BRIC .

Some in this list are a bit surprising to me. Click into the link to see more, and to see other similar lists from the World Bank and from the CIA World Factbook.

 List of countries by GDP (nominal) 

 
This [Wikipedia] article includes a list of countries of the world sorted by their gross domestic product (GDP), the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. The GDP dollar estimates presented here are calculated at market or government official exchange rates.

Several economies which are not considered to be countries (world, EU, and some dependent territories) are included in the list because they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison.

This list from Wikipedia ranks the foreign exchange reserve (including gold and SDRs).

As most of us know, China has the largest, holding 27
% of the world total. After this are Japan, Russia and Taiwan.

 List of countries by foreign exchange reserves 

Foreign exchange reserves (also called Forex reserves) in a strict sense are only the foreign currency deposits held by central banks and monetary authorities. However, the term foreign exchange reserves in popular usage (such as this list) commonly includes foreign exchange and gold, SDRs and IMF reserve position as this total figure is more readily available, however it is accurately deemed as official reserves or international reserves. The list excludes currency swaps conducted by central banks.

These are assets of the central banks which are held in different reserve currencies such as the dollar, euro, yen and pound, and which are used to back its liabilities, e.g. the local currency issued, and the various bank reserves deposited with the central bank, by the government or financial institutions. Before the end of the gold standard, gold was the preferred reserve. Some nations are converting foreign exchange reserves into sovereign wealth funds, which can rival foreign exchange reserves in size.

This is a list of countries and territories by foreign exchange reserves in US dollar equivalence. Some nations have multiple monetary authorities, counted separately, such as the People's Republic of China, which has three (mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau). Exchange rate fluctuations can have significant impact on these numbers. While most nations report in US dollars, a few nations in Eastern Europe report solely in Euros.

A list or countries by their public debt for 2008 would not be too revealing. What is of greater interest are the debts due to the recent stimulus packages to try to revive the economies.

The US can go into debt, keep borrowing from others. There is a limit to how much Japan and Italy can do it.

 Government debt 

 
9 Mar 09 [Economist]
Rich countries, especially, are piling up debt

AMERICA, Britain and China are among the many countries that have adopted spend-now-pay-later policies to stave off economic disaster. But giant fiscal stimuluses, tax cuts and bail-outs are weighing heavily on public finances. In a paper prepared for the forthcoming G20 summit, the IMF sets out new forecasts for government debt.

Japan's debt burden, which is already the largest of the world's big economies, will reach a sumo-sized 225% of GDP in 2010. Rich countries' debt is set to grow from 83.3% of GDP in 2008 to almost 100% in 2010. Developing economies will see much smaller growth from 35.7% to 37.8% in two years, but these countries also have lower debt tolerance....

Looking at the GDP numbers, How come Canada is still in the G8?

 

It's supposed to be the major developed democracies...
 
 
LOL! I suppose once you are in this very exclusive rich man's club, you do not get kicked out.

Anyway, this below is taken from Wikipedia.

 
The Group of Eight (G8, and formerly the G6 or Group of Six) is a forum, created by France in 1975, for governments of eight nations of the northern hemisphere: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; in addition, the European Union is represented within the G8, but cannot host or chair.
 

G6 was started in 1975, after the 1973 'oil crisis'. After this, Canada joined next year in 1976 to become G7. Russia joined in 1997 to make it G8.
 
 
This next list is for top oil exporting countries, 2007, taken from  Country Energy Profiles  of EIA (Energy Information Admin) of the US government.

Rank, Country, Exports (1000 bbl/d)

1 Saudi Arabia 8,038
2 Russia 7,054
3 United Arab Emirates 2,507
4 Norway 2,340
5 Iran 2,326

6 Kuwait 2,291
7 Nigeria 2,082
8 Venezuela 1,960
9 Algeria 1,907
10 Angola 1,711

11 Libya 1,584
12 Iraq 1,501
13 Mexico 1,381
14 Kazakhstan 1,213
15 Canada 1,058

Ever since the oil price started rising since the oil crisis of 1973, these countries got rich fast, and even more so when oil price jumped in 2007 & 08 to a peak of $147.
 
 
 
Looking at the GDP numbers, How come Canada is still in the G8?

 

Because the US wanted Canada in. No other reason.

Excellent thread idea Merlin.

Here's my contribution by posting a list of the world's largest exporters, by annual volume in US$.

17. Taiwan - $255b
18. Singapore - $235b
19. United Arab Emirates - $207b
20. Brazil - $200b

I wonder how many people realise that after years of robust growth and becoming the low-to-medium end manufacturing hub of the world, China still isn't the world's largest exporter yet! Won't be long though before it surpasses Germany.

Yep, but you'll have to reclassify China as Greater China in this case.

Funnily enough, you add HK's & Macau's nominal GDP to China's and it still comes up short to Japan's. But another two years (or three) & the Chinese will go nationalistically crazy!

Chinese will go nationalistically crazy!
 

Oh, most of the old-hundred-names just don't care about rankings as for the policy maker's POV, it is not the ranking that matters, it is the impact that counts. Here is a good example, Japan ranks above China in almost all measures, but yet it showed no economic leadership in the current economic downturn. (or the 1997 crisis)
 
 
 
Here's one more statistic... the world's biggest debtor nations...

 The World's Biggest Debtor Nations 

 

Urh.... You just don't get it. It's external liabilities exclusive of external assets.  

The UK has massive overseas investment, but the UK has massive stakes overseas. The true picture is that the UK has more of the latter (and as such has a large service surplus to mitigate her huge trade deficit).  

As for nominal comparisons, hey...? The Euro is over-valued, but Sterling is competitively priced against the Dollar (US). [ Source:  Big Mac index | The Economist  ] So why compare chalk with cheese...?

I am not very conversant with the jargon that you are using. Would really appreciate if you could please explain that in layman terms. Thank you.
 
 
Not sure what needs to be explained, so please forgive any confusion.

All countries have an external debt (though North Korea may be an exception). It's part-and-parcel of free-trade. For example: Jaguar-LandRover is owned by Tata, an Indian company. However Vodafone has interests in India. So both are treated as external-debt, but the later has more value.

Nominal values are pounds-in-your-pocket. One pound Sterling is approximately 80 Rupees. For £1 I can buy a can of Scrumpy-Jack. Does it cost 80 Rupees in India...?

Hence Purchase-Price-Parity (PPP). What does the money actually buy the consumer. The Big-Mac Index is a tongue-in-cheek measure created by The Economist/EIU to compare nominal values with "real" value. A Big-Mac should cost the same wherever it is produced/consumed.

Threads like this one are boo-yah: you can measure and observe anything but it is down to interpretation. To quote the obvoius - there are lies, damned lies, and statistics....
 
 
GDP for a country is quote in either norminal or PPP values. I excerpt below the meaning of PPP, taken from  Purchasing power parity  in Wikipedia.

 
This purchasing power SEM rate equalizes the purchasing power of different currencies in their home countries for a given basket of goods. Using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards on the whole between nations because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of different countries, rather than just a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) comparison.

Thanks,

I wrote that very, very early in the day and could not remember the correct term. Hat-tip to you sir!  
 
 
Look at the case of Japan and South Korea. Japan had a negative growth by -0.1% in 2008, while South Korea had a positive by 2.2%. When you go to the List of Countries, Japan's total GDP jumped from 4,376,705 million to 4,923,761 million, a 12.5pct hike, South Korea's from 969,795 million to 947,010 million dwindling by 2.3pct. It's due to the appreciation of Japanese Yan and depreciation of Korean Won. Isn't it a wealth on paper indicator? What I know is many Koreans living in China fled back home, unable to pay their bills with the Won's shrinking value, leaving a colossal amount of unpaid bills in China.

China considered taking recourse against these debtors, South Korean government called on these people to honor their debts, don't know the development now.
 
 
If anyone is interesting, here are some more information on the  Big Mac Index  taken from Wikipedia.

 
The Big Mac Index is published by The Economist as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and provides a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It "seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible ".[1]

The index takes its name from the Big Mac, a hamburger sold at McDonald's restaurants.

The Big Mac Index was introduced in The Economist in September 1986 by Pam Woodall as a semi-humorous illustration and has been published by that paper annually since then....

One suggested method of predicting exchange rate movements is that the rate between two currencies should naturally adjust so that a sample basket of goods and services should cost the same in both currencies (PPP). In the Big Mac Index, the "basket" in question is considered to be a single Big Mac burger as sold by the McDonald's fast food restaurant chain. The Big Mac was chosen because it is available to a common specification in many countries around the world, with local McDonald's franchisees having significant responsibility for negotiating input prices. For these reasons, the index enables a comparison between many countries' currencies.

The Big Mac PPP exchange rate between two countries is obtained by dividing the price of a Big Mac in one country (in its currency) by the price of a Big Mac in another country (in its currency). This value is then compared with the actual exchange rate; if it is lower, then the first currency is under-valued (according to PPP theory) compared with the second, and conversely, if it is higher, then the first currency is over-valued....
 

This is the Big Mac Index chart for 2008 from the Economist.

 
 
 
*** sigh *** PPP again.
 
 
Here is a ranking of countries by oil consumption, by number of barrels per day (bbl/day).

Top 20 oil consumers (bbl/day).

World - 85,220,000

1. United States - 20,680,000
2. European Union - 14,380,000
3. China - 7,880,000
4. Japan - 5,007,000
5. India - 2,722,000
6. Russia - 2,699,000
7. Germany - 2,456,000
8. Brazil - 2,372,000
9. Canada - 2,371,000
10. Mexico - 2,119,000
11. South Korea - 2,080,000
12. France - 1,950,000
13. United Kingdom - 1,763,000
14. Italy - 1,702,000
15. Spain - 1,611,000
16. Iran - 1,600,000
17. Indonesia - 1,564,000
18. Saudi Arabia - 1,000,000
19. Netherlands - 984,200
20. Australia - 966,200

The US on a country-by-country basis is in a league of its own! Just amazing. No wonder the US Navy sails in every corner of the globe…

I suspect India will overtake Japan in oil consumption within a decade. South Korea should climb up the consumption ladder too because of the rapid growth of its heavy industry.

What are everyone's thoughts on this list? Should make for some vibrant discussion  

You can see the full list at  https://www.cia.gov/library/publicat.../2174rank.html

where does united states use all this oil ??????????

I mean last time i roam around the country there were not enough industry to use this much oil. And suerly china should be using more. with all this bright side development and ( on dark side the pollution we see ). Is it just because of automotive ?

I think india and china use far less oil per person compared to anybody else.

but still the amount of pollution is insane. there is something really wrong out here.

I think india and china use far less oil per person compared to anybody else.

 

The use of oil per person is really interesting. There are several large groups in a list above.

(Day use of oil)/(Population)*1000

1. Canada 70 (!) and USA (67)

2. Japan, Australia, S. Korea and Saudi Arabia ~ 40

3. EU and EU countries ~ 30

4. Russia, Mexico, Iran ~ 20

5. Brasil 12

6. Rest is about 5. China 6, India 2, Indonesia 7.
 
 
 
Looking at the GDP numbers, How come Canada is still in the G8?

 

I have added in populations

1 United States 14,264,600 306,500,000
2 Japan 4,923,761 127,630,000
3 China (PRC) 4,401,614h 1,338,156,900
4 Germany 3,667,513 82,062,200
5 France 2,865,737 65,073,482
6 United Kingdom 2,674,085 61,612,300
7 Italy 2,313,893 60,090,400
8 Russia 1,676,586 141,825,000
9 Spain 1,611,767 45,853,000
10 Brazil 1,572,839 191,325,912

11 Canada 1,510,957 33,662,000

So take population into account and I think it is very clear; as to why Canada is still in the G8!
