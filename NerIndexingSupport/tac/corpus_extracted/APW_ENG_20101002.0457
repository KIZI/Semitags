Bruno Genevois has been appointed as the France anti-doping agency's new president to replace Pierre Bordry, who resigned last week after a five-year tenure.

Genevois' appointment was announced on Saturday in the Official Journal of the French Republic after France President Nicolas Sarkozy signed a decree.

Genevois is a jurist specialized in public law and is also a member of the Council of State.

Bordry didn't give any reason for his resignation, but he battled last year with French authorities to obtain a proper budget for the agency.
