President Dmitry Medvedev has signed a decree appointing Alexander Bedritsky as
presidential advisor for climate change, the Kremlin press office said Friday.

Bedritsky will be in charge of climate-related issues and countermeasures
against climate change, Sergei Naryshkin, chief of the presidential
administration, told reporters.

The advisor will also represent Russia's stance on climate change within
international multilateral frameworks and act on behalf of Medvedev in climate
change meetings in multinational formats, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted
Naryshkin as saying.

Bedritsky, currently president of the UN specialized agency World Meteorology
Organization, will draft Russia's position at the upcoming UN Climate Conference
in Copenhagen.

Bedritsky has been chief of Russia's Federal Service of Hydrometeorology and
Environmental Monitoring since 1993. He was elected WMO president in 2003 and
was reelected to another four- year term in 2007.
