There's a reason revenge isn't being
overemphasized this week as Texas preps for Texas Tech, the team
that gave the Longhorns its only loss in 2008: It often doesn't
work.

Sometimes it even backfires and makes a team more susceptible to
another loss.

It's all why the Texas coaches are telling players to look
forward this week, not back.

"They deserved to win that night," Longhorns quarterback Colt
McCoy said of Tech. "They played great, but we need to come out
this week and not focus on that, not focus on what happened, but
focus on, 'Hey, what do we have to do to be the best that we can be
this year?"'

It's general human nature to linger on what happened in Lubbock
last year, when the top-ranked Longhorns lost on the final
offensive play of the game, 39-33. But history shows that revenge
doesn't always work out well:

Consider Texas' five-year losing streak to Oklahoma from
2000-04. The last four of those losses, Texas wanted revenge.

Or those consecutive losses to Texas A&M in 2006 and 2007. The
Aggies prevented Texas from getting to the Big 12 title game by
upsetting the Longhorns in Austin in 2006 -- on Senior Day. Texas
was upset again one year later in College Station. The UT seniors
were playing their final regular-season game. It didn't matter.

Three seasons ago, fourth-ranked Texas lost on the road to
unranked Kansas State, 45-42. The Wildcats knocked Colt McCoy, then
a redshirt freshman, from the game. The loss also blew up Texas'
chance to defend its national title.

The following season, there were all sorts of revenge aspects of
the game that could have fueled the Longhorns. But Kansas State
still drilled Texas at home, 41-21, for the worst home loss in
Brown's tenure. Oh, and Kansas State knocked McCoy out of that
game, too.

There are successful revenge games, although some come later
than the fans might have hoped.

When the Longhorns broke their five-year losing streak to
Oklahoma in 2005, they won 45-12, tying their biggest margin of
victory in the 100-game series.

Last season, after losing two years in a row to the Aggies,
Texas brutalized A&M, 49-9. It was the largest margin of victory in
110 years.

Perhaps the most immediately successful case of revenge came in
1999, when the Longhorns were aching to pay back Tech after a 42-35
loss the year before. The defeat, which was decided in the final
seconds, kept Texas from the conference title game.

The Longhorns decimated the Raiders 58-7 in Austin the next
year. It was the worst loss in Tech school history.

The players on this year's team were in elementary and middle
school the last time Texas paid back Tech in such an emphatic way.

And no one seems to be buying into the revenge hype this week.
Or at least they're not saying so.

"Well, first of all, whenever we lose here at Texas, it's
really disappointing because it doesn't happen that often," guard
Charlie Tanner said, "One thing we've got to do here is put it in
the past."
