Every Sunday morning, the deep, melodious voice
of state Sen. Ruben Diaz Sr. rumbles across the congregation at his
Bronx church. On weekdays, it echoes across the Senate chamber as
he rails against Medicaid cuts or abortion. This summer, it
thrilled thousands at a boisterous rally against same-sex marriage.

But ask him about the gay people in his own life, and Diaz's
voice grows quiet. His smile vanishes.

Two of his brothers are gay, he murmurs, one of them recently
deceased. So is a granddaughter. There is an old friend who works
for him in the Senate. And a former campaign aide.

"I love them. I love them," says Diaz, who grew up one of 17
children in Puerto Rico. "But I don't believe in what they are
doing. They are my brothers. They are my family."

His voice rises again. "So how could I be a homophobe?"

For those fighting to expand gay rights in New York, Diaz, a
Pentecostal minister, represents the most outspoken and
unpredictable of foes. He was forced to resign from the city's
Civilian Complaint Review Board years ago for suggesting that the
Gay Games would encourage homosexuality and spread HIV. In 2003, he
sued the city to shut down a high school for gay and transgender
students.

As advocates push for a vote on same-sex marriage in the state
Senate on Tuesday, Diaz, a Democrat, is again speaking out, arguing
that last week's election results show that the tide has turned
against allowing gay people to wed.

"The people of the nation don't want gay marriage," Diaz said
in an interview Monday. "They didn't want it in California; they
didn't want it in Maine. And the people of upstate New York, after
what happened to the candidate in the 23rd Congressional District,
they sent a message they don't want gay marriage. Forget about it.
People don't want it."

Diaz argued that the bill legalizing same-sex marriage should
not be allowed to come to the floor, saying the Legislature has
more important issues to attend to.

And some of his colleagues on Monday, while avoiding his
provocative language, appeared to be moving to that position,
worried that the political climate is too tense and the state's
fiscal crisis too urgent for the issue to be taken up now. On
Monday evening, the fate of the measure was still uncertain.

"Not only have we just had that huge setback in Maine," said
Matthew Titone, a Democratic assemblyman from Staten Island who is
lobbying Senate colleagues to approve same-sex marriage, "but the
elections showed us that anti-incumbency is a real worry for
everyone elected right now."

The fight over same-sex marriage has thrust Diaz, 66, back into
a familiar role -- dissenting from, exasperating and infuriating
Democratic Senate leaders and many of his colleagues.

Earlier this year, he and three other Democrats initially
refused to back Malcolm A. Smith, the Senate's top Democrat, for
the post of majority leader, throwing the Democratic caucus into
chaos until Smith offered them perks and committee chairmanships.

Diaz is also the Senate's most outspoken opponent of abortion,
and he once argued that harvesting stem cells for research was no
different than Hitler harvesting "the ashes of the Jews to make
bars of soap."

"He always comes into conference or onto the floor with his
mind made up, ready to argue," said Sen. Eric T. Schneiderman, a
Democrat who represents parts of Manhattan and the Bronx. "And he
loves to argue."

But to Diaz and his friends, the senator's steadfast opposition
to gay rights seems at times incongruous.

Christopher R. Lynn, Diaz's chief counsel in the Senate, who is
gay and lives with his partner and their daughter in Queens, said
that he has undergone three back operations, and that every time he
goes into the hospital, Diaz has been there. "He is a true
believer in Christian values, in treating people the way you want
to be treated," Lynn said.

Diaz describes Lynn as "my brother." They often double-date
with their respective better halves. Lynn has tried to win Diaz
over on gay marriage, but Diaz's mind is not easily changed.

"He said to me, 'For me to accept this, I have to turn my whole
value system upside down,"' Lynn said.

And Diaz, whose South Bronx district is the second-poorest in
New York, also raises his voice loudly on behalf of the poor. He
was a fierce advocate of tax increases for the wealthy and
threatened to withhold his vote from a budget deal this spring
unless Gov. David Paterson dropped cuts to a state agency that runs
programs for the elderly. (Nearly all the money was restored.)

Some liberals in the Capitol are reluctant to criticize him for
his social views because he has been a reliable ally on economic
issues, all the more effective, some say, because he cannot be
dismissed as a left-leaning ideologue.

And, given the Democrats' fragile majority -- the party has 32
senators to the Republicans' 30 -- Diaz's stubbornness often yields
results.

"I see people looking at me, like, 'Look at this guy, uhhh,
look at this guy,"' Diaz said, rolling his eyes. "And in the end,
I get what want."

In many ways, Diaz seems conflicted. He basks in the glow of his
heterodoxy, and relishes the role of the lonely, embattled
dissident. He baits Democratic leaders, sometimes practically
taunting them to throw him out of the party or otherwise rebuke
him. "The majority is not always right," he sometimes says. "The
majority crucified Christ."

Still, the senator resents those who brand him a bigot for his
views. At times, he seems to plead for understanding.

"My religion doesn't allow me to dance," he said. "But that
does not mean I don't go to the party. My religion doesn't allow me
to drink. But that doesn't mean I can't hang around with my
friends. My religion is against gay marriage. It means, I don't
agree with what you do. But let's go out. Let's go to the movies.
Let's be friends."

Diaz grew up in Puerto Rico, in Bayamon, just southwest of San
Juan. His father, a carpenter, had five children with his mother;
Diaz also had 11 half-brothers and sisters. He joined the Army out
of high school, in 1960, and served at Fort Jackson, S.C.

He moved to New York in 1965 and fell into drugs. Arrested for
possession of heroin and marijuana, he got probation. Not long
after, in a Brooklyn church, he found God. He became a pastor, a
community leader, a city councilman, a senator.

"If not for Jesus, I would be dead," Diaz said.

Affection seems to flow to him from unexpected places. On a tour
of his district, Diaz eagerly showed a reporter Christian Community
in Action, an agency he founded in the burnt-out ruins of the old
Bronx to provide home health aides to the sick and elderly. There,
Diaz bounded up to greet Vincent Ortiz, a supervisor he has known
for eighteen years.

"We fight, of course," said Ortiz, who is gay. "But it is
mostly good years."

But then there are moments of coldness. Last year, Lisa Winters,
who runs the Bronx Pride Community Center, a group for gay youth,
requested a meeting with the senator in Albany. He never responded.
She showed up anyway, with a group of gay teenagers, and was told
that Diaz was not in. Moments later, she said, they saw Diaz
leaving his office by a side door.

(The senator said he does not recall this happening. "I never
hide from anyone," he said.)

"He's an embarrassment," Winters said. "He uses his position
not only as a clergy member, but as a politician, to preach hatred
about gays."

This spring, Diaz led a small delegation of legislators to
Puerto Rico, and at the end of the trip, after the official
meetings, he hosted a farewell barbeque at his family's home.

His brother -- whom Diaz will not name because, he says, the
brother is not openly gay -- was there to greet the guests. There
was no discussion, Diaz said, about how he would vote on gay
marriage.

"We talked about it enough," Diaz said. "They know who I am;
I know who they are; we don't need to talk about that anymore."
