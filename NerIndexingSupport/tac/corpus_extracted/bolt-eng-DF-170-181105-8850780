  YouTube - Howard Dean: Public Option is Key to Healthcare Reform 

Who are you going to trust? A former practicing doctor who has created a working health care model in Vermont, or the dis-information machine of Coulter, O'Reily, Beck, and the Repubs?

This is more serious business than those who are opposing this can wrap their minds around. If you disagree with a part of the bill... great, let's talk about it. But we need to be discussing REAL facts about the bill and come together as AMERICANS to solve this problem. What is happening is an utter disgrace... it's a disgrace to all of us, even those who are being manipulated and used.

except that his health care model didn't work and the number of uninsureds grew while he was governor as did the cost, you're 100% right.

I don't know for sure.

New Hampshire is the home of the Free State Project, though.

BURLINGTON, Vt.

The winds of secession are blowing in the Green Mountain State.

Vermont was once an independent republic, and it can be one again. We think the time to make that happen is now. Over the past 50 years, the U.S. government has grown too big, too corrupt and too aggressive toward the world, toward its own citizens and toward local democratic institutions. It has abandoned the democratic vision of its founders and eroded Americans' fundamental freedoms.

Vermont did not join the Union to become part of an empire.

Some of us therefore seek permission to leave.

the libtard possee will be here shortly to castigate vermont just as they did Texas..

No, that's the weird Governor of Texas, who keeps threatening to secede, but he was persuaded to take some stimulus money.
 
 
A bit off-topic, but has Screaming Howie released his gubernatorial records yet?

Just WTF was he hiding in there?

The rate at which Vermont uninsured grew was much smaller than national average (there's barely even rose with small sample size). Everyone's numbers and costs have gone up dramatically over the past 15 years. That's why we're in this mess. So compare them to what other states have done, and get back to me.
