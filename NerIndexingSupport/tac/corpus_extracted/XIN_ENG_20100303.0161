LOME, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Togo's plan to open the presidential elections on
Thursday is closely watched by observers, who are still worried about high
stakes in the process despite newly unveiled security measures, probably the
best since the West African country started holding multi-party elections years
ago.

A total of 3,281,146 voters registered out of a population of 6 million will go
to the polling stations across the country of 56, 000 square km.

They will choose the future president of Togo among the seven candidates in the
race where one round mode of election is being used.

The outgoing president, Faure Gnassingbe, is facing six other contenders, who
could be losers in political calculations without harmonizing their action,
although they well know the importance of supporting one another.

It will be the sixth pluralistic election in Togo with a record number of
candidates considering the successive multi-party polls that have been organized
in the country since 1993.

Going for his second term, Faure has mobilized his party, associations and other
allies including the opposition renegades.

By contrast, the six opponents are opting for a formula where they regroup
according to their political visions, instead of a common strategy to avoid
division.

They have formed two such groupings. The main opposition party, the United
Forces for Change (UFC), is the backbone force of the Republican Front for
Change (FRAC) comprising four other political parties and an association to
expand the political base of its candidate Jean-Pierre Fabre. The purpose is to
harvest more votes by getting help from the regional heavy-weights.

Another coalition is based mainly on the Democratic Convention of African People
(CDPA) and the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) , which is the country's
second largest opposition party. The two held electoral consultations before
joining the grouping called the Coordination for Change, which also includes the
Organization to Build Togo in Unity and Solidarity (OBUTS) and the Citizens'
Movement for Democracy (MCD).

Faure, who is searching for his second five-year term, is seen as powerful to
face the challenges form the two opposition groupings which also have their
deputies in parliament. Both opposition coalitions have declared that "they will
defend their victory and govern the country together."

FRAC is currently represented in parliament by 27 deputies from the UFC, while
the Coordination for Change represented by 4 deputies from CAR.

The Coordination for Change is also famous for the country's first female
candidate from CDPA, Kafui Adjamagbo-Johnson. Well known for her gender equality
activities, she is counting on the support of women who form 52 percent of the
Togolese population.

There are two other isolated parties with less appeal: the Party of Renewal and
Redemption (PRR) and the PanAfrican Democratic Party (PDP).

Many observers and voters fear that stakes remain high after witnessing violence
in the presidential elections held in April 2005, which brought Faure to power.
Differences over the one- round election and the voter list revision led to a
brief withdrawal of leading opposition parties. The election date had to be
postponed from Feb. 28 to March 4.

But things are not all that negative. The country successfully held the October
2007 legislative elections, which were declared as transparent and without
violence. That could be an important heritage to ensure Thursday's voting
another success, observers say.

In election campaigns which ended on Tuesday, the opposition parties were
invariably speaking of change in their platforms, while the ruling Assembly of
Togolese People (RPT) was talking of pursuing the development program that had
already begun.

To ensure that the election is transparent and violence free, a number of
monitors have been deployed to follow the process, including 3,300 national
observers, 130 from the European Union, 40 from the African Union and 250 from
the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

Togo itself has a detailed security plan under the Presidential Election
Security Force (FOSEP-2010) to deploy 6,000 officers on the ground during the
elections.

For the first time, Togo has put an National Independent Electoral Commission
(CENI) in place on the basis of political consensus. The body is charged with
the mandate to organize and supervise the vote, and publish its provisional
results.
