 
 
why do we oppose riots yet support foreign ones?
 
 
it is a bit strange huh
 
 
if you won't go to bed at least try to be funny
 
 
Because in other countries they happen to overthrow dictators. They happen here because a few dossers see the opportunity to get free stuff while destroying the livelihoods of decent people.
 
 
if you have to pay for a TV license then your country is run by Dicktators...so its about time to overthrow those Dicktators!
 
 
cuz in other countries they are seen as a response to "no human rights" "dicatators"
here they are seen as "all criminals" "criminality"

Isn't it interesting for foreign riots the news story consists of predominately quotes from rioters and a just few quotes form the government while here its the complete opposite?
Just a thought.

It probably says something about my mental state at this time of morning that I'm even going to attempt an answer:

The Libyans/Egyptians are fighting for democracy and their basic human rights.
The English rioters are doing so for the sheer joy of it.

See the difference?
 
 
 
Get some sleep mate...  
 
 
The mods are pathetic for not banning you already. The amount of trolling you have done in the past hours are beyond a joke.

The Dangerous Classes rise up....
The dangerous classes have risen up but are unaware of the oppression that is to come. The higher classes will not stand for this, expect drug penalties to increase and policing in their neighbourhoods to intensify. And the cycle begins again.

Soceity criminalizes drugs (which is a big part of black culture, mainly cannabis), incarcerates users and suppliers (majority black men and white working classes), in order to purify soceity of the undesirables aka the dangerous classes.

With their relatives and friends in prison, the rampant glorification of gangster culture via the media, discrimination by the police, economically and social deprivation, how do you expect working class youth (black and white) to behave?

This will imo not blow over. What has happened over the last few days are just a sign of things to come.

We only support ones where the dictator in question has run its course.

Not surprising that the Egyptians, Tunisians were successful in ousting their dictators. Libya is a unique example, even though it has oil reserves, the dictator is just too radical and unpredictable. He has to go.

Kuwaitis, Bahrainis, Saudis, Yemen (Saudi allies)......well the fact most people have forgotten about them (no reporting from media) and that they were quelled says it all.

Assad is also out of time and can be replaced.
 
 
These foreign riots are against "corrupt" governments and are usually when people's rights are being suppressed.
Our riots are because chavs and scum want a new TV.

Big difference.
 
 
The youth of the Middle East riot for basic freedoms e.g. democracy...
Whereas the youth of London riot for a 42" T.V.
 
 
Speak for yourself. And 1,000 warning points?

 
 
 
The people in the Middle East want democracy. The rioters in London want a widescreen TV.

Interesting? Maybe to a moron - or someone with an entrenched anti-establishment agenda.

Obviously the UK government isn't a shining beacon of hope and perfection, but equally it is a reasonably reliable, responsible institution. Rioters in other countries are rioting against an oppressive dictatorship, rioters here are after self gratification. I know lots of people are blinded by their hatred of government - but surely no-one could be this obsessed?

Hmm. Lets examine what you just wrote;

Obviously the UK government isn't a shining beacon of hope and perfection. I didn't say it was, nor did anybody for that matter. In rhetoric this is called the straw man fallacy.

equally it is a reasonably reliable, responsible institution
"Reasonably reliable" is what is called a weasel word. What precisely constitutes what is considered reasonably reliable? And on whose standards? Instead these terms are so vague they effectively mean nothing while trying to give the impression of substance.

Rioters in other countries are rioting against an oppressive dictatorship, rioters here are after self gratification. Yet rioters in other countries (even oppressive countries) also loot and torch property. Are you saying all current rioters sole-purpose are for self-gratification? By this you make a sweeping generalization that is completely unsubstantiated and you imply socio-economic context has nothing to do with the riot. The latter of which is obviously stupid because no one is not affected by their context.

I know lots of people are blinded by their hatred of government - but surely no-one could be this obsessed?   Basic ad hominem attack. Assuming even if I had an "anti-establishment agenda"(whatever that means ), does that reduce the validity of my argument in any way? No.

Your response is just a collection of fallacies and empty rhetoric.
 
 
They aren't rioting in this country, they're vandalising and looting for the sake of it.
 
 
We are all subjects of an unelected monarch in this country, if the rioters were rioting against that then I would have some sympathy for them, but they're not. I also have some sympathy for the protestors trying to prevent another police cover up on Saturday night and that they're frustration at being met with a wall of silence spilled into unrest, but what stealing a pair of trainers has to do with getting justice for a member of your community I'll never know. As for all the copycat riots I simply have no sympathy whatsoever.
 
 
Because the riots in England and riots abroad have different causes. If a riot in Libya for example was just looters stealing TVs for the hell of it then no one would support it; but since the "riots" in Libya are an attempt to overthrow a dictator, they're much more justified. If the riots in England had a valid reason behind them, they would probably be supported by the general public.
 
 
 
 

 

The guy stood in the right hand corner...  
 
 
The majority of those in Egypt, Syria and Libya, Bahrain and Yemen are not rioting, they are peacefully protesting. there is a difference.
 
 
The riots in foreign countries were for a very good cause, fighting against corrupts governments and such. Ours are just borderline retarded chavs destroying their own towns and communities for fun and out of boredom.

cause their army is shooting innocent civilians.
 
 
In other countries there is also heavy support in the sense of peaceful constructive protests which clearly outline their political agenda and what the protesters want. There is a heavy political motivation (e.g. ousting a regime).

In the english riots, the only real protest was against the police for shooting mark duggan. In response, both a police investigation and an IPCC investigation have been opened up in order to find out what happened. The rioting/looting itself is fueled by very little (if any) political motivation and is mainly fueled by a selfish desire to steal or a general enjoyment out of causing as much havoc and terror as possible. How can anyone say its justified that a bunch of teens break into a mother/baby shop and steal all the childcare equipment or set fire to a family owned furniture store. Even when challenged, the rioters reasons are vague or completely ridiculous such as "its only a laugh", "I'm getting my taxes back" (a 15 year old actually said that) and "its the governments fault, they are going to take away EMA" (since when was EMA for buying 42" TVs and expensive trainers?).

In conclusion, the protests/riots in the Arab world are generally supported because they have the political objective of securing better living conditions for hundreds of millions of people. The rioting and looting in the UK are not being tolerated due to a complete lack of political substance, only being made up of criminal activity and a complete lack of empathy toward fellow humans. They are not interested in furthering the lives of their peers or future generations, they are merely interested in wreaking havoc and lining their pockets.

Do I really need to answer this? You know the answer deep deep down don't you?

I didn't say you said it was (and am confused as to how you came to that conclusion)... It was coming from my perspective as you clearly mistrust them, so I was pointing out although I don't - I equally don't see them as perfect.

How exactly does "reasonably reliable" mean nothing? It is a pretty standard way of describing something which isn't from a source that you can always trust 100%, but is likely to be accurate and fair. (Let me guess, you have a problem with "likely" now as well?).

Socio-economic context does have everything to do with the riots - you are unlikely to break into a shop and steal a pair of trainers with £1 million sitting in the bank - but it has no valid reason to be there, hence the dismissal.

Again, anti-establishment agenda is a pretty standard way of describing someone who has an agenda against the establishment - i.e. the government in this case. Why are you finding these relatively simple phrases so difficult to understand? And yes it would reduce the validity of your argument as it introduces bias (though I'm not saying you personally are anti-establishment).
