Well, at this stage in our football season, or what is left of it for us
Jints/Jets fans; all I can say is.....

Go Yanks

and oh so looking forward to the Rangers having another great year! Drop the
puck! Becuase I can't bear to watch another Jints kickoff.

It just goes to show, that hope does spring eternal for NY fans.

RED in NC
