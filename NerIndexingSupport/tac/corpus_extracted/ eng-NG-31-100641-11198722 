I was searching Ebay Political Autographs and found this item  4 Lines
in George Washington's Hand as President Item number: 170178164754 For
a $1.00 WHAT???? no signature just he /her word that Geroge Washington
wrote these lines. He/she has various presidential clipped signature
going from $1.00-129.00 ranging from JQA to Franklin Pierce and
Millard Fillmore, and a one from James Monroe starting from a dollar.
I not a expert by any means but these type of autographs( meaning our
early president signing) in this range seems to  good to be true. Any
thoughts??. And I'm not trying to slam this company it just seems a
too good. And they charge the following fees.
