Well after much debating i have decided to take the plunge and go to
Madrid. Our neighbour died on Monday at the age of 51 and hey what the
heck, life's too short!!!
So anyway, any tips for a good hotel, and a good area to stay. I'm
taking my wife and daughter and going to make a holiday of it.
Also, for those going, and who have an iPod, you can download a free
city guide to madrid at http://www.podcityguides.com/

Jeff,

The guy I work beside is from Madrid and he's been feeding me advice
(even though he's Real fan :-).

If you're looking for nightlife and to be in the centre of things, you
want to be in the Puerta del Sol/Plaza Major area....basically known
as 'old Madrid'.

We've book the Hotel Moderno right next to Sol metro station, but I
see that it seems to have been mega popular with Dandies and is
practically (or is) sold out.
Nae worries, there are tons of 2/3 star hotels and hostels around
there.

The Puerta del Sol is a 10 minute metro ride or 30 minute walk to the
stadium, and would seem to be the ideal location.

The Gran Via area is a little bit further north, with Retiro and that
Prado further east. Depends what you want, and where you want to be.

Incidentally, Madrid nightlife is apparently the best in Europe...and
also the latest...even for Spain.

Don't expect a nightclub to open before around 23.00 and it won't get
busy until after 02.00. Dinner is generally taken late, especially at
the weekends, and apparently things are relatively quiet in bars and
cafes until around midnight.

This is going to be a culture shock for many, as it's going to be a
matter of pacing ourselves a wee bit differently. Each to their own,
but I'll be taking it easy in the afternoons and hitting the tapas
from 17.00 onwards.....I want to be fit and fresh for the clubbing
until morning.... ;-))

Insider tip from my mate : there are places in the centre of Madrid
that open AFTER the nightclubs close....at around 06.00 or something
like that. They're blacked out, and basically they're morning clubs
for anybody who has the time and energy (or drugs) to keep on going.

Nothing better than clubbing at breakfast time....cannae wait !

jings...I just saw that you're taking your missus and daughter.

Ignore everything I told you, and start looking for the address of
Zara and ice-cream shops.

;-)))
