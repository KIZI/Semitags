When advocates for judicial reform point to
examples of how money can influence courtroom decisions, they often
cite as exhibit A the case of Hugh M. Caperton.

It's not hard to see why. In 2002, a West Virginia jury awarded
$50 million to Caperton after finding that the powerful chairman of
Massey Energy, Don L. Blankenship, had set out to financially
destroy him and his small coal company. Even as this state's
highest court repeatedly threw out that award, though,
controversies emerged over ties between Blankenship and court
judges.

One judge stepped aside in 2008 from the case after photographs
showing him vacationing alongside Blankenship in Monte Carlo popped
up. Another judge recused himself after the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled last year that he should not have ruled on Massey's appeals
because Blankenship had spent $3 million supporting his election.

The machinations in Caperton's case served as a plot line in
John Grisham's courtroom drama, "The Appeal." In March, the West
Virginia court voted again to overturn Caperton's award, holding
for the third time that he should have sued Massey in Virginia, not
West Virginia.

On Tuesday, Caperton followed that suggestion and sued Massey in
Virginia. He and his lawyers also made West Virginia's justice
system a part of that filing, charging, among other things, that
the ties between Blankenship and the court justice who had
vacationed alongside him, Elliott E. Maynard, had made a mockery of
justice.

"I think that anyone can connect the dots and see what
happened," Caperton said.

In a statement, Massey Energy, the country's sixth-biggest coal
producer, said it had not seen the new lawsuit. But the company
said, "Mr. Caperton's claims have been rejected by the West
Virginia court system multiple times, and we hope that his
attorneys have not decided to waste more resources by seeking to
bring a meritless case back to the Virginia court system."

For his part, Maynard, who no longer serves as a judge, said he
had not seen the lawsuit and had no comment on it. This month,
Maynard was defeated in his bid to become a U.S. representative
from West Virginia, an effort that received financial backing from
Blankenship.

Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the School of Law of the
University of Pennsylvania, said that while he was not familiar
with the specifics of the Massey case, he believed that Caperton
would probably have to reargue his case against Massey before a
Virginia judge or jury.

Caperton's decision to forge ahead with his long-running battle
against Blankenship comes as Massey confronts other issues. For
one, federal officials are continuing to investigate the cause of
an April explosion at a Massey mine in West Virginia that killed 29
miners, the coal industry's worst disaster in 40 years.

The legal fight has left Caperton, a tall, soft-spoken man of
55, badly battered. Twelve years after the first lawsuit was filed,
he remains unemployed, in debt and barred by the federal government
from owning a coal company. When Blankenship backed out at the last
minute from talks to buy Harman Mining, Caperton's company quickly
plunged into bankruptcy, and he defaulted on a bond that the
government requires coal companies to post to pay for the cleanup
of old mines.

His efforts to find other kinds of work in the coal industry
have also failed, he says, because companies fear reprisals from
Blankenship. Caperton's most recent job interview was with a coal
company based in Australia.

"It is all the uncertainty," he said, seated on a recent day
on the back patio of his rambling home near here. "I have used up
all up my retirement and spent everything on this case."

The roots of his claim stretch to 1997. At the time, Caperton,
who grew up in a family that operated a coal mine in Slab Fork,
W.Va., was running Harman, which was based in western Virginia.

The Harman mine produced a very high-grade coal sought by steel
makers. For years, it had sold all its production to another
company, Wellmore Coal, which blended it into a coal mixture that
it sold to a big steel company, LTV.

When Caperton learned in late 1997 that Massey had bought
Wellmore's parent company, he initially thought that his business
would continue as usual. He would later learn from court
proceedings that Blankenship had a different agenda; he had decided
to cut out Harman and force LTV to buy cheaper coal from Massey,
court papers show.

When LTV rejected to do so, Blankenship undertook a series of
steps, a jury later found, intended to crush Caperton and Harman.
Among other things, Massey directed Wellmore Coal to set off a
clause in its contract with Harman that voided that agreement,
knowing that doing so would put the small company into a financial
tailspin.

In addition, Massey bought a strip of land surrounding the
Harman mine to make it unattractive to potential buyers. And when
Blankenship entered talks with Caperton to buy Harman at a deep
discount, he told Caperton that he should never think about suing.

"He said, 'I spend a $1 million a month on attorneys, and I
will tie you up in court for years,"' Caperton recalled.

In 1998, after Harman filed for bankruptcy, the company sued
Wellmore Coal in a Virginia state court for breach of contract,
eventually winning a $6 million judgment. That same year, it also
filed a separate action against Massey in a West Virginia court for
tortious interference, the action that led to the $50 million
award.

Along with the legal setbacks, the last few years have been
particularly hard for Caperton and his family. In 2007, he fell off
his house's roof while cleaning gutters, breaking his back and
feet. Then, doctors discovered a tumor on his kidney that turned
out to be cancerous. In 2008, he underwent surgery at the Cleveland
Clinic to have part of his kidney removed.

For his wife, Kathy, Caperton's legal travails have seeped into
every aspect of their family's life. Her husband's case began
shortly after the couple's daughter, Preston, was born. Last year,
Preston, now 13, made her father's lawsuit the subject of a project
that she entered into a statewide social studies competition.

"It's been our entire marriage," Kathy Caperton said.

      (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)

Recently, Caperton has started traveling around the country to
speak about his case and judicial election reform. He found himself
not long ago in Washington on a speaker's dais alongside luminaries
like Sandra Day O'Connor, a former justice of the Supreme Court.

He recently said that he had no expectation that his case would
end soon, but one day, he hopes, it will.

"I would love one day to wake up and not think about Don
Blankenship and what I've been through," he said.
