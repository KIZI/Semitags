What you may have guessed, Ken Dewey has confirmed.  

Oct. 1-11 was the coldest Oct. 1-11 period on record for Lincoln, with records going back 123 years to 1887.

High temperatures over the weekend were usually the highs Lincoln records for early to mid-December, according to Dewey, professor of applied climate science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Saturday's high temperature at the Lincoln airport was only 38 degrees. The previous record low maximum for the date was 41, set in 1987.

Sunday's high temperature was only 40 degrees. The previous coldest maximum was 47, in 1946.

Similar record-low maximums were set across much of Nebraska. Several cities also had record minimums.

Dewey said the average temperature for the first 11 days in Lincoln was 46.7 degrees, almost a full degree colder than the 48.6 degree average temperature for Oct. 1-11, 2000.

Also in top 10:

1935: 49.3 degrees

1925, 1977: 49.6 degrees

1987: 50.3 degrees

1985: 50.4 degrees

1891: 50.7 degrees

1952: 51 degrees

1988: 51.1 degrees

1959: 51.4 degrees

The weekend cold was part of an Arctic blast that also brought snow to most of Nebraska. On Saturday, the North Platte airport record 13.8 inches of snow -- not only a daily record but more snow in one day than the city had ever received in the full month of October.

Sunday night, another weather system brought a new band of snow to the central and northern Sandhills, with average snow accumulations between 1 and 3 inches.

Temperatures are expected to improve somewhat the next couple of days, but rain is likely Tuesday afternoon and night, the weather service said.

Highs should reach the mid-40s Tuesday, around 50 Wednesday and Thursday, the upper 50s Friday and Saturday and the lower 60s on Sunday.

Just because the polar caps are melting and sending in a breeze of arctic air for a few days now and then, does not negate the fact that the OVERALL temperatures are going up..

I don't care how many "record lows" there are- the record highs are trumping the lows, and have been for many many decades. The overall mean temperature has increased by over two degrees in just a hundred years.. A few days of record lows, even worldwide, will not change those figures.

ENSO Dominates NODC Ocean Heat Content (0-700 Meters) Data
UPDATE October 8, 2009:

KNMI corrected a problem in its NODC Ocean Heat Content data on October 1, 2009. The error grew in effect with the distance from the equator. It changed the scale of the variations but did not drastically change the overall shape of the curves. The problem, therefore, had no real impact on this post, which illustrated the timing of ENSO-induced step changes in a number of ocean subsets. But to prevent a disagreement between the data presented in this post and future ones, I have redone the graphs in the following.

In the original version of the post, I had also provided links to graphs of unsmoothed versions of Figures 3 through 14. I have not provided them in this revision.

This post also updates the data through June 2009.

The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) recently added the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) Ocean Heat Content (OHC) dataset to their Climate Explorer website, allowing users to download data based on user-defined global coordinates.
 Climate Explorer: Select a monthly field 

This OHC dataset was presented in the Levitus et al (2009) paper “Global ocean heat content(1955-2008) in light of recent instrumentation problems” [GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L07608, doi:10.1029/2008GL037155, 2009]ftp://ftp.nodc.noaa.gov/pub/data.nodc/woa/PUBLICATIONS/grlheat08.pdf

There are differences in the presentation of the data. The NODC illustrates their OHC data for the 0 to 700 meter layer in 10^22 Joules, but KNMI presents the data on an area-averaged basis, in units of Gigajoules (10^9 Joules) per square meter. The data is the same; the units in which the data is presented are different. Also, the NODC provides the data on a quarterly basis; that is, the data is grouped in three-month averages. KNMI presents the NODC OHC data on a monthly basis by listing the quarterly data for each of the three months. This is why the OHC data appears to be squared off in the graphs of monthly raw data. This can be seen in Figure 1.

  Climate Change: As a Colorado Rockies playoff game is snowed out, scientists report that Arctic sea ice is thickening and Antarctic snow melt is the lowest in three decades. Whatever happened to global warming?

Al Gore wasn't there to throw out the first snowball, er, baseball, so he might not have noticed that Saturday's playoff game between the Colorado Rockies and the Philadelphia Phillies was snowed out  in early October. The field should have been snow-free just as the North Pole was to be ice-free this year.

It seems that ice at both poles hasn't been paying attention to the computer models. The National Snow and Ice Data Center released its summary of summer sea-ice conditions in the Arctic last week and reported a substantial expansion of "second-year ice"  ice thick enough to have persisted through two summers of seasonal melting.

According to the NSIDC, second-year ice this summer made up 32% of the total ice cover on the Arctic Ocean, compared with 21% in 2007 and 9% in 2008. Clearly, Arctic sea ice is not following the consensus touted by Gore and the warm-mongers.

This news coincides with a finding published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters last month by Marco Tedesco, a research scientist at the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology. He reported that ice melt on Antarctica was the lowest in three decades during the ice-melt season.

Each year, millions of square miles of sea ice melt and refreeze. The amount varies from season to season. Despite pictures taken in summer of floating polar bears, data reported by the University of Illinois' Arctic Climate Research Center at the beginning of this year showed global sea ice levels the same as they were in 1979, when satellite observations began.

At the 2008 International Conference on Climate Change, hosted by the Heartland Institute, the keynote speaker, Dr. Patrick Michaels of the Cato Institute and the University of Virginia, debunked claims of "unprecedented" melting of Arctic ice. He showed how Arctic temperatures were warmer during the 1930s and that most of Antarctica is indeed cooling.

At the other end of the earth, we are told the Larsen B ice shelf on the western side of Antarctica is collapsing. That part is warming and has been for decades. But it comprises just 2% of the continent. The rest of the continent is cooling.

A report prepared by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research for last April's meeting of the Antarctic Treaty nations in Washington notes that the South Pole has in fact shown "significant cooling in recent decades."

Reassessment of the Potential Sea-Level Rise from a Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
Jonathan L. Bamber,1,* Riccardo E. M. Riva,2 Bert L. A. Vermeersen,2 Anne M. LeBrocq3

Theory has suggested that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be inherently unstable. Recent observations lend weight to this hypothesis. We reassess the potential contribution to eustatic and regional sea level from a rapid collapse of the ice sheet and find that previous assessments have substantially overestimated its likely primary contribution. We obtain a value for the global, eustatic sea-level rise contribution of about 3.3 meters, with important regional variations. The maximum increase is concentrated along the Pacific and Atlantic seaboard of the United States, where the value is about 25% greater than the global mean, even for the case of a partial collapse.

Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets May Be Shrinking Faster than thought
As reported in Science (9 October 2009,Vol. 326. no. 5950, p. 217) losses from the great ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland appear to have accelerated during the past 7 years. The results, in press at Geophysical Research Letters, are based on measurements by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission.

The mass changes of Greenland and Antarctica during the past seven years have all been negative, geophysicist Isabella Velicogna of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, concludes in the study. On Greenland, she calculates, the rate of ice mass loss doubled over the seven-year period, producing an acceleration of –30 cubic kilometers of water lost per year. On Antarctica, the loss rate more than doubled to produce a similar acceleration. Together, that would make for a 5% acceleration each year in the rise of sea level. Compounded year after year, "that is a big thing," says Velicogna. "We should be more concerned." For further details, please read the full Science article.

Article from: The Australian
ICE is expanding in much of Antarctica, contrary to the widespread public belief that global warming is melting the continental ice cap.

The results of ice-core drilling and sea ice monitoring indicate there is no large-scale melting of ice over most of Antarctica, although experts are concerned at ice losses on the continent’s western coast.

Antarctica has 90 per cent of the Earth’s ice and 80 per cent of its fresh water. Extensive melting of Antarctic ice sheets would be required to raise sea levels substantially, and ice is melting in parts of west Antarctica. The destabilisation of the Wilkins ice shelf generated international headlines this month.

However, the picture is very different in east Antarctica, which includes the territory claimed by Australia.

East Antarctica is four times the size of west Antarctica and parts of it are cooling. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research report prepared for last week’s meeting of Antarctic Treaty nations in Washington noted the South Pole had shown “significant cooling in recent decades”.

Australian Antarctic Division glaciology program head Ian Allison said sea ice losses in west Antarctica over the past 30 years had been more than offset by increases in the Ross Sea region, just one sector of east Antarctica.

“Sea ice conditions have remained stable in Antarctica generally,” Dr Allison said.

The melting of sea ice — fast ice and pack ice — does not cause sea levels to rise because the ice is in the water. Sea levels may rise with losses from freshwater ice sheets on the polar caps. In Antarctica, these losses are in the form of icebergs calved from ice shelves formed by glacial movements on the mainland.

Last week, federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett said experts predicted sea level rises of up to 6m from Antarctic melting by 2100, but the worst case scenario foreshadowed by the SCAR report was a 1.25m rise.

Mr Garrett insisted global warming was causing ice losses throughout Antarctica. “I don’t think there’s any doubt it is contributing to what we’ve seen both on the Wilkins shelf and more generally in Antarctica,” he said.

Dr Allison said there was not any evidence of significant change in the mass of ice shelves in east Antarctica nor any indication that its ice cap was melting. “The only significant calvings in Antarctica have been in the west,” he said. And he cautioned that calvings of the magnitude seen recently in west Antarctica might not be unusual.

“Ice shelves in general have episodic carvings and there can be large icebergs breaking off — I’m talking 100km or 200km long — every 10 or 20 or 50 years.”

Ice core drilling in the fast ice off Australia’s Davis Station in East Antarctica by the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Co-Operative Research Centre shows that last year, the ice had a maximum thickness of 1.89m, its densest in 10 years. The average thickness of the ice at Davis since the 1950s is 1.67m.

A paper to be published soon by the British Antarctic Survey in the journal Geophysical Research Letters is expected to confirm that over the past 30 years, the area of sea ice around the continent has expanded.

 Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE 

Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE

Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE
I. Velicogna

Department of Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, California, USA

Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA

We use monthly measurements of time-variable gravity from the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite gravity mission to determine the ice mass-loss for the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets during the period between April 2002 and February 2009. We find that during this time period the mass loss of the ice sheets is not a constant, but accelerating with time, i.e., that the GRACE observations are better represented by a quadratic trend than by a linear one, implying that the ice sheets contribution to sea level becomes larger with time. In Greenland, the mass loss increased from 137 Gt/yr in 2002–2003 to 286 Gt/yr in 2007–2009, i.e., an acceleration of −30 ± 11 Gt/yr2 in 2002–2009. In Antarctica the mass loss increased from 104 Gt/yr in 2002–2006 to 246 Gt/yr in 2006–2009, i.e., an acceleration of −26 ± 14 Gt/yr2 in 2002–2009. The observed acceleration in ice sheet mass loss helps reconcile GRACE ice mass estimates obtained for different time periods.

Good God! Read the abstract carefully! What the scientists are saying here is the the PETM occurred with less of an increase in CO2 than previously believed. That a lower level of CO2 set off a chain of events that created far more warming than thought possible. In other words, the threshold for major changes may be much lower than previously believed. Strange that you should believe that information is a good thing.

Carbon dioxide forcing alone insufficient to explain Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum warming
Richard E. Zeebe1, James C. Zachos2 & Gerald R. Dickens3

Top of pageThe Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (about 55 Myr ago) represents a possible analogue for the future and thus may provide insight into climate system sensitivity and feedbacks1, 2. The key feature of this event is the release of a large mass of 13C-depleted carbon into the carbon reservoirs at the Earth's surface, although the source remains an open issue3, 4. Concurrently, global surface temperatures rose by 5–9 °C within a few thousand years5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Here we use published palaeorecords of deep-sea carbonate dissolution10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and stable carbon isotope composition10, 15, 16, 17 along with a carbon cycle model to constrain the initial carbon pulse to a magnitude of 3,000 Pg C or less, with an isotopic composition lighter than -50. As a result, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increased during the main event by less than about 70% compared with pre-event levels. At accepted values for the climate sensitivity to a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration1, this rise in CO2 can explain only between 1 and 3.5 °C of the warming inferred from proxy records. We conclude that in addition to direct CO2 forcing, other processes and/or feedbacks that are hitherto unknown must have caused a substantial portion of the warming during the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Once these processes have been identified, their potential effect on future climate change needs to be taken into account.

 'Runaway' melt on Antarctica, Greenland - Climate Change- msnbc.com 

'Runaway effect' in places
"To some extent it's a runaway effect. The question is how far will it run?" said lead author Hamish Pritchard of the British Antarctic Survey. "It's more widespread than we previously thought."

"We were surprised to see such a strong pattern of thinning glaciers across such large areas of coastline," he added, "and in some cases thinning extends hundreds of kilometers inland."

In a statement, the British agency said the authors had found that the "dynamic thinning" of glaciers:

now reaches all latitudes in Greenland;
has intensified on key Antarctic coastlines;
is penetrating far into the ice sheets’ interior;
is spreading as ice shelves thin by ocean-driven melt.
Ice loss from many glaciers in both Antarctica and Greenland is greater than the rate of snowfall farther inland, the researchers added.

In Greenland, the research found that 81 of the 111 glaciers surveyed are thinning at an accelerating, self-feeding pace.

In Antarctica, some of the fastest thinning is on the west coast where Pine Island Glacier and the neighboring Smith and Thwaites glaciers are thinning by up to 30 feet a year.

Greenland, Antarctica Ice Melt Accelerates
Seth Borenstein, Associated Press

Going... Going... | Discovery News Video Sept. 23, 2009 -- New satellite information shows that ice sheets in Greenland and western Antarctica continue to shrink faster than scientists thought and in some places are already in runaway melt mode.

British scientists for the first time calculated changes in the height of the vulnerable but massive ice sheets and found them especially worse at their edges. That's where warmer water eats away from below.

In some parts of Antarctica, ice sheets have been losing 30 feet a year in thickness since 2003, according to a paper published online Thursday in the journal Nature.
 
 
 Greenland, Antarctic Ice 'in Runaway Melt Mode' - Biology | Astronomy | Chemistry | Physics - FOXNews.com 

WASHINGTON — New satellite information shows that ice sheets in Greenland and western Antarctica continue to shrink faster than scientists thought and in some places are already in runaway melt mode.

British scientists for the first time calculated changes in the height of the vulnerable but massive ice sheets and found them especially worse at their edges. That is where warmer water eats away from below. In some parts of Antarctica, ice sheets have been losing 30 feet a year in thickness since 2003, according to a paper published online Thursday in the journal Nature.

Some of those areas are about a mile thick, so they still have plenty of ice to burn through. But the drop in thickness is speeding up. In parts of Antarctica, the yearly rate of thinning from 2003 to 2007 is 50 percent higher than it was from 1995 to 2003.

There is no data indicating considerable cooling of the earth's climate. In fact, given what is the normal variation with the ENSO and solar cycles, it has much to warm the last ten years.

As far as the measures to alleviate the problem, I did not even address them in this thread. I simply posted what the real scientists are finding, not the prostitutes like Watts, Lindzen, and the rest of the people that have sold their integrity for the energy companies money.
