U.N. again throws out Taiwan bid for recognition

TAIPEI - The United Nations has again ruled out a U.N. role for Taiwan, a Taipei official said on Thursday, despite a recent thaw in relations with China which considers the island a breakaway province.

A U.N. subcommittee decided on Wednesday in New York it would not let the General Assembly consider Taiwan's request for permission to join U.N. activities, an island foreign ministry official said.

Fifteen attempts by Taiwan to join the United Nations have failed, most recently last year. The United Nations ousted Taiwan in favor of China in 1971.

This time, Taiwan was not applying for membership, just to take part in unspecified U.N. "activities."

China has seen self-ruled, democratic Taiwan as part of its territory rather than as a separate country since the island broke away from Mao Zedong's Communists amid civil war in 1949. Statehood is a requirement for U.N. membership.

But since taking office in May, Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou has declared a diplomatic truce with China, which has about 170 allies worldwide compared to Taiwan's 23.

"The foreign ministry expresses regret," deputy minister Andrew Hsia told a news conference.
 
 
Silly of the UN.

If Palestine can have Observer status, why not Taiwan?
 
 
ray,

 
Silly of the UN.

If Palestine can have Observer status, why not Taiwan?
 

because none of the permanent UNSC members are dead-set against the idea of a palestinian authority having observer status.
 
 
because the late president of Republic of China Cheng Khai Shek insisted that his exiled government is a legitimated representative of Mainland China. for so many years he refused to gain independent because he though he could go back and defeat PRC. so you can not have 2 UN seats in one country. Nixon gave its UN seat to PRC to break up Communist Axis. a good political move- i would said.

Taiwan blew the only chance their got in 1949. an independent status is increasingly unrealistic and provoke military action. Chinese is famous for their border hunger. they silly enough to claim entire state Arunachal Pradesh.

wrong.
 
 
Taiwan signed their death warrant when they withdrew from the U.N. after the U.N. accepted the PRC as a member. Not even the U.S. officially recognizes them.
 
 
It wasn't Taiwan's choice.

You realize that it wasn't a willing decision. They were more or less kicked out.

Edit: What OoE said.
 
 
Because the UN hates Israel, but is sympathetic towards China?
 
 
 
...

so you can not have 2 UN seats in one country.

...

 

Not true. The USSR had several seats.
 
 
 
Not true. The USSR had several seats.

 

Different seats are for different councils-ECOSOC, GA, SC, etc.-1 country seat per council, but a country cannot have two seats in the GA or two seats on the SC.

Again, not true.

The USSR had three seats at the time of the founding of the UN in 1945. They were titled: Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine.
 
 
Chinese have broken the will of Taiwanese, by either threathening the war or luring with profit.

Nobody bothers that any more.

That is three separate seats for three separate entities.

Well apparently they didn't break their will enough to prevent Taiwan from applying for UN status or enough to the point that Taiwan just throws it's hands up and joins the PRC.

Threats of war from China aren't really death threats. (Read the who knows how many posts on hypothetical PLA/PLAAN/PLAAF invasion of Taiwan)

Luring with profit? What? I don't understand what you're talking about... Do you mean bribing?
 
 
 
That is three separate seats for three separate entities.

 

Byelorussia and Ukraine were both part of the USSR. Three seats, one entity.

It would have been the same if the US got a seat, but so did Texas and Pennsylvania.

They don't do it currently though, at least to my knowledge. Either way, GA runs under "one state one vote" so to my guess, multiple representatives per state could provide conflict of interests.

I am sure that the multiple representatives always voted the way they were instructed by the central government. Especially if they wanted to keep their cushy job. UN reps live pretty high compared to the average citizen, of whatever country, and the job is so undemanding that a blind, brain-damaged monkey could handle the task.
 
 
I think PRC is too big to ignore..  
 
 
 
because none of the permanent UNSC members are dead-set against the idea of a palestinian authority having observer status.
 

So, terrorists are acceptable and not those who are and want to be separate?

True, Taiwan has no financial or political clout!

And the Big Four requires Chinese money and industry.

That much for all the moral standing of the Big Four!

Like it or not, speaks much about the fraud that the Big 4 perpetuates!
 
 
taiwan's official name is still republic of china,their airline called china airline,and the airline of mainland china called air china.may cause a lot of confusion abroad.

china rules taiwan for several dynasties,early last centuary,taiwan was invaded and ruled by japan,after the defeat of japan,taiwan was given back to china.98% of the population of taiwan are ethnic han chinese.

i guess it is impossible for them to get independence,unlike palestine,taiwan has never been recognized as a nation,and its official name,republic of china shows that well.and china is a permenant member of the security concil,it has veto power to kill any taiwan related motion,so those trying to join the un is very futile.

I don't think you understand the UN. Last I checked, the UNSC plays absolutely deciding who joins the GA or not. That's left to a majority vote in the GA.

not really just the Big 4's fault- plenty of states take chinese money (and also taiwanese money, when taiwanese diplomats want to make a play for legitimacy).

also, under chen shui-bian taiwan tried to increasingly portray itself as a different state (Republic of China, Taiwan, to Taiwan). somewhat problematic when the ROC, up until 1991, insisted that it was the sole legitimate government of all china.

There's something like 23 countries that recognize Taiwan. And the only two of any note I think are the Vatican and Paraguay (bring up joke of "your second country is Paraguay"). Most of the recognizants are Caribbean and Pacific Island countries.

With the increasing economic and personal (mainlanders moving to Taiwan and Taiwanese moving to the mainland) links between the two, they'll eventually come together. Say, 25 years or so.
 
 
Two Koreas, two Vietnams, and two Germany but no two China? WHY?!

The reason may be because both the ROC and PRC claim that there can only be one China... but that doesn't make sense. UN recognizes NK and SK even though they don't recognize each other. Whats going on here UN? This needs an explanation, but I doubt anyone can give one. I sure as hell can't.
 
 
akaloc,

ROC no longer holds to the claim of only one china.
 
 
rj1,

that's the hope of the PRC. however, polls conducted over the last 20 years in taiwan have shown that there's been a development of a separate taiwanese identity. we'll see how that plays out.

The largest trading partner

the largest investment destination
the largest source of exporting surplus

the list go on and on`````````

Taiwan was integrated into Great china economical circle.

Since when the UNSC became the Great moral idol club?  

The main purpose of security council is prevent war and confilict ----
without the cooperation of major POWERS, UN and its security council would be just an meaningless empty shell ! let along keep peace.

Therefore, security council is only a negotiation table for the Big 5 to ensure that they can secure their interests peacefully without having to wage World war3 or initiate proxy wars.

You can not wishfully thinking votes can provent a major power like US, soviet or China from securing their core interests, if they cannot get it on UNSC they would simply get it by other undemocratic and unpeaceful means, and UN will simply disentangle like the “LeagueofNations” before WW2, at least now we can protend to be very polite on each other at UNSC. Thanks to this bazaar of national interests(UN), we are more civilized and rational these days comparing to 100 years ago, but never delude yourselff that the old Power diplomacy was over, they just get a new garment.

Without the mutual understanding, balance and approval between the powers, countless Korea war, Vietnam war, Iraq war will fought and today's world will be just like 1900 europe where the Bigger Gun had a louder SAY.

Therefore Soviet states was granted the right of vote not because they are really different states, it is because, comparing to US and Britain, soviet has a BiG gun but less client states.

Imagine A nation has Bigger gun but small say what will they do? They would just quit and go rogue!, therefore, US and Britain give soviet states the right of vote just to make sure the volume of Soviet is not significantly lower than his nuclear stockpile

If you catch this, you would also understand that Tawwan is OUR CORE INTEREST which is neither negotiable nor recede-able. US and other power undertand this so they only taunt us on other unimportant issues while leave this hotspot along.
 
 
UN doesn't care for Taiwan and ignores others who deserve recognition?

**** the UN and its bid.

It's my understanding, the last time I checked, that there are some other 187 countries that represent the entity of the United Nations. Which soley represent the views of the World. This should be taken into account. And, merely the UN stated purpose is not to adhere to the MAJOR powers intrest. It's a place, for the views of the world, to be discussed and where the intrests of the world may be taken into account. Regardless of which countries have a louder say or more influence.

The threat you speak of, the possibilities of war, world war that THOSE intrests must be reserved, and if they wern't, would cause wide spread pandamora is ridiculus.  

If they were dead on intent, regardless of the United Nations being a podium for that debate, it would happen regardless within or without the UN. Only thing is that the WORLD might not agree with you.

The important thing, that needs to be taken into consideration, is that the countries that make up the world has just as much to say, with regards on there views as do others and the threat of blackmail shouldn't obstruct that ideal.

One power may wonder:
Is it the worlds do not agree with me or the US(China) client states do not agree with me?

Should every contury has a vote or should it be proportional with the population?

Should one country and its people submit to 'The worlds opinion" or should they fight for their national interests?

For example: A UNSC vote 10:9 suggest that US should give back parts of his land to natives, the next day the UN HQ would be shut down

And if a UN vote to take in Taiwan passed, PRC would simply quit

Do you think US CHina or Russia or UK or France would submit to a highly unfavorable vote?

If they do not concede, would would UN do? what damage may cause to the credibility and the prestige of UN?

If one of the power quit UN, do you really think the world will be better or more peaceful?

If two power quit UN, do you really think UN and whatever it represents may still hold?

Worse, if UN decided to Invade Iran while (If) Chiina and russian has vowed or decided to defend it? what would happen?

The veto power is not only a protection to powers, it is also a protection to the comparative weaker camps like china-russia.

If powers do not have veto, One lone superpower like US can easily monopoly the world by using his economical, political,military influence to mastering,black mailing, bribing massive tiny states, poors states, weak states to vote against other powers, and once the weak camp is connered, they would consisder war as a solution insteading of meaningless talk in UN

I respect your sincere idealogy concerning a supposed "World Government"

But the truth is : neither does it exist now nor will it exist in near future.

Time and time again, I here the same exact thing. :D

Your very passionate on the issue. I respectfully acknowledge that.

All I'm saying like before, you are not the only country with disputes. There are many. I'm not advocating that United Nations is out to get any sole party or as you suggest cause strife, however, merely pointing out there are other entity within the entity of the United Nations which have to be taken into consideration. Being a member of the United Nations, you acknowledge possible adverse affects, "that might not go your way". Sure, you may resort to FORCE. However would FORCE ultimately change RECOGNITION, in which you seek?

Look I have my personal views, as we'll as you. I support the status-quo however I also support the right of self-determination. Ultimately support peace, for a place, such as Taiwan. As conflict could have devastating consequences. But I belive very much in self-determination. But I don't see gaining membership into the United Nations, prerequisite, for self-determination. Neither so much the Hong Hong model. Of course, that is where self-determination comes in, its up to them.

Well, still I respect your sincere idealogy concerning allegated self-determination```````I recall A US couple has self-determined to establish a XX republic in Texasif my memory serves. They resist Taxation and got caught`````

But I m not a good guy as you(only a reasonable one), therefore I donot wish to gain a moral high ground by placing support on the 'innocent' and 'democratic' Taiwan

My concern is my wellfare and the wellfare of my son and my groundsons,and our interests for now is align with the interests of PRC gov. Given the fact that Taiwan is vital for the security and economical development of mainland china,I support PRC gov on his stance over Taiwan issue wholeheartly.

However, to be reasonable, I would also taken taiwan and his people's wellfare into balance and I am sure the PRC gov will give Taiwan a very very favourable position

Why concerned about the welfare of those living in Taiwan? It's no worse, and I would argue that the quality of life in Taiwan is much better than that in the PRC on average.

It's vital to the security of the PRC...how? The ROC will not be the one to strike the first blow. The two countries are interconnected economically, but what does integrating the ROC do for China economically that would be beneficial to both parties?

Taiwan is not in the position to just give itself up to the PRC. It has no incentive to. It's doing fine on it's own. Why give that up and risk control under the PRC?

I am fully aware of the economic and security relations between the two countries. You missed my point. Why is the integration of the ROC into the PRC necessary? By no means does the ROC want to be part of the PRC. The integration acts solely in the interests of the PRC.

I do suggest you not go off degrading other members of this board. Not to say I am an expert in this field, but I have read through and contributed to a good deal of posts related to this topic on WAB, I'm guessing before you even knew this place existed.

Taiwan represents very little to China's power projection unless you want to project power onto some fish. However, as a direct threat to the Mainland's Coast Line, Taiwan represents a very real threat... if such forces were ever stationed on Taiwan.

I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about energy security. Taiwan imports her oil.

I don't understand your logic. Are you saying that any country that has the ability to pose a threat should be taken over? Your reasons are based entirely on the self-interests of the PRC. They have little beneficial value to any other country. Furthermore, why would Taiwan want to threaten PRC shipping? You accuse me of not being aware of the rising tensions in that area, so I assume you know the "limited knowledge" I have in this field, and realize that preemptive strikes conducted by the ROC against the PRC is just ludicrous. If I didn't know better, next thing you'll be saying is that China should be extending it's power to the far reaches of the globe... Maybe Yeung was right. You're sounding like an imperialist.

No that is not my logic, I only give a explaination on Taiwan and China's energy security.

We chinese are not that stupid to think that if we invade every pearl on our oil route and we will be safe.

US is there, Russia is there,india is there, the whole world is there. If we do that, we are asking for bullets

The situation is, We have Claim on Taiwan and we have every ethnic, legitimate,diplomatic evidence to prove that Taiwan is an integrated part of China, which is also recognized by worlds, and we have show our good will in both trading and talking. We have so far restrain ourselves to the urge of unification and hope we can achieve it peacefully, be it 100 year or 200 year later.

And if you want to argue with me on moral ground, I would simply cite the diplomatical speech by PRC Gov, and I am sure you dont want to hear that old crap
 
 
 
so I assume you know the "limited knowledge" I have in this field, and realize that preemptive strikes conducted by the ROC against the PRC is just ludicrous. If I didn't know better, next thing you'll be saying is that China should be extending it's power to the far reaches of the globe... Maybe Yeung was right. You're sounding like an imperialist.

 

I am very regreted to misunderstood you on the knowledge matter and myslef is also far from perfect-- not to mention I have less informative sources here. So can we let it pass?

But labeling me with imperialist title wasnt very constructive too```````  .

And I understand that you hold a unfavourable view toward my country because she is not as democratic as yours. So I havenot yet adopt the same moral/emotion appealing appoaches as my fellow chinese often do, but if you think we do not have a moral foothold on this matter, then you re wrong``````
 
 
 
Taiwan stands between middle east and all of our main ports`````````

 

Hogwash. I don't see the RoCN arresting your ship captains nor kicking you out of their fishing grounds.

 
Taiwan and its other ISLANDS are best bases to project our power to South sea, where we have dispute with some SE asia countries. THere are oil too.

 

I think you better look at a map first. For Pete sakes, Mainland China provides better locations than Kinmen. Sheesh.
 
 
 
Hogwash. I don't see the RoCN arresting your ship captains nor kicking you out of their fishing grounds.

I think you better look at a map first. For Pete sakes, Mainland China provides better locations than Kinmen. Sheesh.

 

Taiwan has many islands````````For example, A 'TaiPing' Island, the largest island in south sea with full infrastracture airfield, ports`````````

So far I only explain why they are vital for our energy security and I NEVER said we will invade them for that matter only.
 
 
Again look at the map. Tell me which of those islands represent a stronger projection than Shanghai.
 
 
 
If you say so``````

But who else doesn t (care about their interests)?  

 

So you think you should invade other peoples just because this serves your own interest or the interest of your own people?
 
 
 
By that I mean in the condition of trading, negociation and reunification( whether it is peacefully or forcefully), mainland chinese will not exploit the interests of Taiwan people, therefore we perfer to wait for a peaceful solution now to maximize the interests of both sides

You suggested we should be more selfish, Eh?

If you really dont know these two questions? then I have no arguement with you``````````The economical relationship between Taiwan and Mainland and its affects has been talked and retalked in many paper and forums. THerefore,instread of wasting both my time and your time, I give you one simple aspect. Taiwan and its size has determined that Taiwan along cannot form a production chain by herself. Hence Taiwan's Main income now is from exporting parts to Mainland, then Mainland factory will integrate it into the whole product and export it over the world```````simple ist it. But you have to google yourself to find other more complicated aspests

about the security of PRC, suggest you take some reasearch on these conception: energy security of China, The first Island Chain of US alliance, Taiwan and PRC power prejection to asia Pacific,You can also ask some military professional here

Suffice to say, Taiwan is more important to China than the Hawaii to US. And if you again do not know what does Hawaii mean to US, I will not bother you any more  

 

Economic dependence does not necessitate unification or make unification 'natural'.
 
 
 
No that is not my logic, I only give a explaination on Taiwan and China's energy security.

We chinese are not that stupid to think that if we invade every pearl on our oil route and we will be safe.

US is there, Russia is there,india is there, the whole world is there. If we do that, we are asking for bullets

The situation is, We have Claim on Taiwan and we have every ethnic, legitimate,diplomatic evidence to prove that Taiwan is an integrated part of China, which is also recognized by worlds, and we have show our good will in both trading and talking. We have so far restrain ourselves to the urge of unification and hope we can achieve it peacefully, be it 100 year or 200 year later.

And if you want to argue with me on moral ground, I would simply cite the diplomatical speech by PRC Gov, and I am sure you dont want to hear that old crap

 

An integral part of China? Maybe.

An integral part of PRC? No.

Are the CCP and China one and the same thing? No.

I hate Mainland Chinese's "黨國不分" mindset (no distinction between the party and the nation/state/people).
 
 
 
Again look at the map. Tell me which of those islands represent a stronger projection than Shanghai.

 

Sir, I don't know where can our J-10 or Su-27 get from Shanghai`````

PLAN is only a green waster navy without carrier groups, therefore, an airfield with the capability of hosting Jet fighters in south china sea is vital for our marine superiority in South China Sea. And our marine superiority in South China sea ensure our power projection capability in South eastern asia. That may further expand our influence globe to SE asia area and secure our leadership and economical interests there.

once we expand our influence globe to SE asia, we would not only secure our energy route but the energy route of Japan and SK. And once their energy security is no longer monopolised by US, they would effectively quit US alliance and stay neutral.

If US lost their effective proxies in Aisa, its first island chain containing china would be breached and may even completely collapse

at that time, PRC will become a true regional power.

The TaiPing Island I mentioned above is the most important island in South China sea

However,Taiwan island itself is more vital in this manner, because Taiwan and Hainan would be the footholding point of the the whole scheme and the foundation of the south china sea island Chain.

Without Taiwan and it islands, our flank in South china sea will become naked and Taiwan's islands simply cut our NAVY power globe into seperated halfs---South sea and east sea.

With taiwan, our first island chain defence would be complete and all the fleet can effective support each other

And if 100 year later, we somehow managed to expand our influence globe to south asia and forming an enduring alliance with india, US's influence globe will have to recede to western hemisphere. Then the world would see a Sino-US co-leadership

Taiwan is the first step, without it the whole map became a day-dreaming.

That my personal understanding of the situation````But do correct me if I made a mistake.  

btw: I state one more time to those good liberals: this is only a view on the importance of Taiwan, not a excuse for any war or invasion. And I do not intend to start a flame war on the so called moral issue.
 
 
And if 100 year later, we somehow managed to expand our influence globe to south asia and forming an enduring alliance with india, US's influence globe will have to recede to western hemisphere. Then the world would see a Sino-US co-leadership.

There is alot more then just China and India in the US eastern hemisphere of influence you tend to over look such places as Phillipines, Japan, etc etc. Trust me when I tell you the US will not recede to the West because these nations that China seeks to influence will demand of many things "transparency" which China is not willing to give any time soon.  
 
 
 
An integral part of China? Maybe.

An integral part of PRC? No.

I have explained it before:PRC can first gain leadership in South eastern asia, then make eastern aisa become neutral or pro-PRC（eastern asia nation's energy route is through SE asia and their largest trading parter is also china)

at the same time when the US dominance is repelled from eastern asia, PRC will court India into a pan-asia alliance

The order is important because SK and Japan are powerful US ally and internetional hotspots, deter US dominance in SE aisa is comparatively easier than drive out US out of Japan and SK

A direct move to SK and Japan, cannot succeed and may even upset US. We wish to buy off US slowly( ). After all, we cannot afford a war.

100 year is to ensure the whole precedure can be carried out largely peacefully. and a peaceful victory must be established on a major advantage in economical and military might.

BTW: how do you know 100 year later PRC will not become democratic and transparent?

What the hell are you talking about?

I don't assume the world is full of or based on love and mercy.

You do naively assume economic dependence makes unification necessary and 'natural'.

You do want to equate the CCP with 'China'.

You do want to deny Taiwan people's right to determine their own fate.

You do want to limit Taiwan's choice.

China CAN force Taiwan to do XYZ, right. But I wouldn't say the PRC has the right to force the ROC to do XYZ. The PRC is not on the moral highland.

In fact, Taiwan and China can coexist peacefully and trade with each other. The CCP doesn't like this idea and threatens Taiwan with force. This is why declaration of formal independence will lead to disaster. We should blame the CCP not Taiwan or history or the rule of heaven or human.

P.S. It seems you wanted to imply that I am as naive as a secondary school student. You have no idea who I am. I have had enough of this stupid way of argument in Hong Kong forums. Please critically think through everything that the media says.

Pipe dreams. China will no sooner become trasparent then she will demorcratic without breaking up. Then where will she be.....powerless. In 100 years how do you know China as we know it will even exist and you think you will deter US intrests especially Japan? Pipe Dreams.  

Japan is an international hot spot?  

How is it that India has finally recognized China as a threat then if you believe you will become best friends.  

Im laughing at you thinking China will replace the US with South Korea and Japan.:P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P:P

And just think I know little as compared to some here so that would just about relay what you know about South Korea, Japan and India.    
 
 
 
Sir, I don't know where can our J-10 or Su-27 get from Shanghai`````

 

The J-10 would most likely fly straight into the ocean. Even with air refuel, its got very short legs when compared to the SU-27. The SU-27 will remain your primary naval air defence role.

 
PLAN is only a green waster navy without carrier groups, therefore, an airfield with the capability of hosting Jet fighters in south china sea is vital for our marine superiority in South China Sea. And our marine superiority in South China sea ensure our power projection capability in South eastern asia. That may further expand our influence globe to SE asia area and secure our leadership and economical interests there.

 

First of all, it's an air strip, not an air field. What that means is that you can rest there, refuel and possibly re-arm but you're not going to do any repairs there. If your plane is grounded over there, it's staying grounded until you can ship it back for repairs.

 
once we expand our influence globe to SE asia, we would not only secure our energy route but the energy route of Japan and SK. And once their energy security is no longer monopolised by US, they would effectively quit US alliance and stay neutral.

 

Will you look at the map first for Pete sakes. Your energy route vulnerability is the Straits of Malaca, not the South China Seas.

 
If US lost their effective proxies in Aisa, its first island chain containing china would be breached and may even completely collapse

 

Not going to happen. A single USN carrier strike group got at least half the firepower of all of China's nuclear inventory. There are 10 such strike groups.

 
The TaiPing Island I mentioned above is the most important island in South China sea

 

The Alamo if you ask me.

 
However,Taiwan island itself is more vital in this manner, because Taiwan and Hainan would be the footholding point of the the whole scheme and the foundation of the south china sea island Chain.

 

What's the point?

 
Without Taiwan and it islands, our flank in South china sea will become naked and Taiwan's islands simply cut our NAVY power globe into seperated halfs---South sea and east sea.

 

Ok, are your fishermen being arrested. Is your cargo trade being confiscated?

 
With taiwan, our first island chain defence would be complete and all the fleet can effective support each other

 

With less than 200 ships? Good luck.

 
And if 100 year later, we somehow managed to expand our influence globe to south asia and forming an enduring alliance with india, US's influence globe will have to recede to western hemisphere. Then the world would see a Sino-US co-leadership

So what is your opinion on the 'party-nation' problem?
Are the CCP and the Chinese nation one and the same thing?

I don't want to argue with you either. The CCP just tries to show they and China are one the same thing, so those who don't like the CCP are unpatriotic.
Yeah, you may think it is an issue 'at the high school level'. Well, this is what happens everyday in Hong Kong.

This also applies to the case of Taiwan. There may be 'evidence' that suggests Taiwan is an integrap part of 'China'. But in fact the CCP is trying to incorproate Taiwan. Many mainland chinese are also talking about the so-called 'one country two system'. So what is the 'one country' going to be?

I am not trying to show that I am more 'intelligent' or 'well-informed' than you. Don't get me wrong. I just get fed up with this kind of Mainland Chinese mindset. I do want to type in Chinese, but I can only type traditional Chinese. You can't read traditional Chinese, can you?

Our 'basic values' don't differ. We both want a better China. Just that you believe the CCP-type authoritarianism is the only way to achieve it, and you don't quite like the idea of human rights (you don't even allow the Taiwanese people to determine their own fate). The CCP has long tried to convince people that there is a necessary conflict between development/economic prosperity and democracy/human rights. Then, everyone will naturally choose economic development (and in effect authoritarianism). You seem to be one of those convinced. No one is going to say they are brainwashed. I understand.
 
 
 
And I understand that you hold a unfavourable view toward my country because she is not as democratic as yours. So I havenot yet adopt the same moral/emotion appealing appoaches as my fellow chinese often do, but if you think we do not have a moral foothold on this matter, then you re wrong``````

 

No. I hold no grudge against China because it's system of government. I may disagree with it, but that does not mean I hold an unfavorable view. Further more, I most certainly do realize that you do have a moral foothold in this matter, as do I. I have a huge problem with your opinion on this because what you are essentially saying is that the PRC should take over the ROC in order to advance China's global status, without regard to the point of view from other countries. Though I was born in the US and have lived here my entire life, I am secondly of Chinese ethnicity and Taiwanese nationality, as this is where my parents were born. I understand the typical stance from mainland Chinese that Taiwan is part of China, but your motives for taking over Taiwan are nothing short of empire building.

Still, it can provide air cover which is most important for our fleet`````and if other side occupy it, not even our future carrier group will be comfortable within its strike range.

 
Will you look at the map first for Pete sakes. Your energy route vulnerability is the Straits of Malaca, not the South China Seas.

 

Aye sir, I know that, but south china sea is the front door of SE asia.
Those three at the staight cannot simply shut our route down under US pressure when the whole SE region is pro-China

IF our marine power cannot even control South China sea, How can we expand our influence globe to SE asia. We can neither protect our ally nor repel our foe at present, who will believe our commitment, who will respect our interests?. Therefore, we must gain control of South CHina sea as the jump-pad to SE asia

 
Not going to happen. A single USN carrier strike group got at least half the firepower of all of China's nuclear inventory. There are 10 such strike groups.

 

It s half CENTURY later sir! Our advance will be have to be backed by comparative advantage of firepower in that region. 50 years later China may be a failed state, but the possibility that it surpass US might in his neighbourhood is also not small at all. Mustn't we start to plan now?  

 
Ok, are your fishermen being arrested. Is your cargo trade being confiscated?

 

I repeat, it is not an excuse of war of conflict``````````
In order to be succeed diplomatically, you must take evey wartime scenario under consideration.
If you enjoy a clear advantage, and repay back some interests and face, A retional foe will recede and see the merit out of it.

Did Hawaii or Philippine ever harass US? but he occupied them none the less,
Now one is part of it and the other is still hosting US base`````

Therefore, what I proposed is only what US are doing now: Use power to lever diplomacy. And do you seriously believe we can ever lever any nation when our navy siting duck in Shanghai while US navy and base tour the world?

 
You mind giving me next week's lotto numbers?

All over the place.

1) It can't move.
2) It's isolated by bad guys all around
3) It's in the South China Seas... ie, I suggest you look at the weather patterns favourable for air operations.
4) It's an air STRIP. Your "cover" is 2 planes.

You know something. I am going to stop here. It is obvious from my point that you know a lot less than you think you know. You don't even know your own nuclear doctrine. It is pointless to discuss anything PLA when you do not know the decisions the PLA has taken and why they've taken those decisions.

I respect your liberal thought, But many in Mainland would rather believe in Darwinism in world politics.

Moral maybe matter something to EU now, but as far as i see, The traditional national powers like Russia, US and China would only use Moral as an cover up---remember Iraq war? Georgia?

It is not whether you are on moral highground matter(in that case Vatican would be the world leader````````:P) It is your power and reason matters.

The world leaders do not lead because they are good, it is because they are not only powerful but also reasonable

They can properly shared the interests between poles and make other power see the merit of his management

The US leadership provide a far better chance and position to asia countries and african countries after WW2 than the colonial powers. most country saw the merits and colonial power saw the inevitable, so a new order forged

However, does that mean US leadership is fair and good? at least to many countries it is not. This order still represents the interests of a small group of country and a small portion of worlds population.

If China can make that group a little bit larger, and if we can give US an graceful exit, a new order can also be established.

But I don t think we can be fair to everybody, only a fool like 宋襄公 will do so.   )

where exactly can Su-27 get from Shanghai and how long it can sustain?

Since when I make such claim? I ve already introduced myself``````MY Thanks to you if you really ever considered me to be a defence professional  

What does PLA nuclear doctrine matter in this cases, did I say we are going to Nuke someone or blackmailing some one?

must PRC and his foreign policy remain remain static? Japan tried to use bribe against might and see how far he can get?

Do you think PRC and PLA will never improve and change their strategy?

Fine, I am also tired of this thread and will end here, hopefully   )

Thank you for pointing out what we always knew since the inception of this topic.

I knew that almost at the beginning of the conversation. Although I personally dont know anyone that serves China's military I also know that one would never handle onself in such reckless fashion.
