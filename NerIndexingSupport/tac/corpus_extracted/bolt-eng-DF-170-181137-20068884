won about 10 titles

UCLA has won one fotlball sincethe1950s

andthey still suck

how can a univ like UCLA win theLA recruitingarea suck so bad
 
 
UCLA has always been a soft teem since the gutty-llittle Bruins era ofTommy Prothro.

Sure they won some Rose Bowls - but they should with their recruiting edges.

Matbe Jim Mora can turn them around,.
 
 
Like losing count......................

Have a 40th HS reunion coming up

on the20 th - in 1992 - BHS was sorta OK won one state tittle in footlball

since 2000 they have kicked behinds in cl national powers..................................10 freakingstate titles or so
 
 
Mora was an assnt coach at Bellevue High School after he got fired from the Seahawks.

Maybe hecan lightafire under the underacheiveing Bruins.
 
 
I remember watching #1 UCLA vs #2 USC in 1967. Gary Beban vs OJ Simpson.

USC won 21-20.

Classic game for the ages.
 
 
 
 
 
1 football title back in the 50s.

Freaking disgrace with all of the resources UCLA has.
 
 
It's the fag powder-puff baby blue uniforms.

Lots of Bruin opps said that they play like girls.
