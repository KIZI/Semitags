 
 
The Greatest Wtf Moments in the History of Cinema
 
 
Those moments in films that have completely led to you thinking Wtf? This is where the twist or shocking revelation has come completely out of the blue and left you feeling suckerpunched with the whole unexpectedness of it all. Or a character does something really stupid or out of character and you've just thought to yourself what were the directors thinking?

I'm nominating:
Chinatown- the reveal that Faye Dunaway's character was Spoiler:
raped by her father and so her sister is actually her daughter and just when she tries to get away with the girl to escape the evil Noah Cross she is shot by her father's cronies and then it implies that Noah Cross will abuse his daughter/granddaughter just like he did with Faye Dunaway's character

The Dark- starring Sean Bean. Spoiler:
The mother's (Maria Bello) sacrifice was for nothing since her daughter was replaced by the ghost of the drowned daughter of the priest. It ends with Maria Bello trapped in the underworld while the evil girl is being driven away with Sean Bean unaware that his daughter has been replaced.
 
 
In Ice Age 2 when all of a sudden there were these 2 sea monsters attacking the arctic animals...now that was like a super-wtf moment!
 
 
I'm going to go with Volver.

Spoiler:
When she's having that conversation with the ghost of her mum, and suddenly you find out about how her daughter is actually also her sister because her father abused her and got her pregnant. I think I actually WTFed out loud when that happened.
 
 
Oldboy

Spoiler:
Oh Dae Su tricked into ******* own daughter

Akira

Spoiler:
ALL OF IT
 
 
NOOOOOOOOOO
THE MOVIES HAVE BEN SPOIIIIIIIIIIIIIILED!

On a serious note, all of the Saw films (except 5, yet...) have led me to WTF.

This is also true. I don't think there's a moment in that film which isn't really, really weird.
 
 
James Bond's Chinese disguise in "You only live twice." Now i understand that Valmorification scene in Team America...
 
 
I don't know if this counts, but I watched High Society and I thought the casting of Frank Sinatra's love interest was a bit WTF. She's really old, I don't know what the casters were thinking.
 
 
Haven't seen it yet, but Ice Age 3 - Dawn of the Dinos.

Didn't the Dinos come BEFORE the Ice Age?!?
 
 
Elephant made me go wtf the entire way through. Major wtf. Not in a good way

Oh and Tale of Two Sisters. This was good
 
 
I would imagine the whole "Luke i am your father" scenario in star wars episode 5 would of been a major wtf moment in when it was released.
 
 
Errrrm...in The Shining when the black guy (the cook) finally gets to the snowed in hotel (after a half an hour build up) and he's killed pretty immediately. A shocker..especially since I'd read the book first and he lived in that

I need to watch that carefully again to 'get' it.
 
 
Definitely Shark Attack 3, where John Barrowman (Dr Who, Torchwood) turns round to the marine biologist and comes out with this cracking line "I'm really wired. What do you say I take you home and eat your p***y?"

 http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=w1XOfHax6Q8 

Definitely a WTF moment!

Thanks for ruining that!

The ultimate: Mullholland Drive, although i get it now...mostly.
 
 
Donnie Darko left me seriously questioning a lot of my actions and behaviour towards certain situations.

Oh my god I totally forgot about that. I think I actually vocalized 'WTF' repeatedly.

You had to expect a few spoilers on this thread!
 
 
Monty Python : The meaning of life...
The whole film is wtf lol
 
 
Fight club. Obviously. You know the bit I mean.
 
 
Pretty much the whole of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, especially the end.
 
 
 

All of it was WTF!
 
 
Perfect Blue.

Well yes, wasn't the best idea I've ever had :P
But in my defense, I started The Shining on Sunday and had to turn it off (pathetic? sure) But I intended to go back to it! I'll just forget what you said. The fear will probably shroud my memory anyway!
 
 
The latest Indiana Jones, the spaceship coming out of the ground at the end!!
They obviously couldn't fink of an ending and thoughtt ooo i know a spaceship!! wtff!
 
 
Any Guy Ritchie film.
 
 
I shall nominate Day After Tomorrow - everything freezes over in New York, so therefore there are arctic wolves roaming the streets. How do they get there?! That is a pretty epic WTF.

Also, Donnie Darko is the ideal WTF-generating machine. Spoiler:
You think you are just about following the whole time-warp, Grandma Death physics author crazyass motivational speaker/paedophile storylines, but when you find out that Frank (the bunny inside his head) is actually a real person at a Halloween party that is also a time portal to the day that he dies, you just end up slipping into a coma from it all or, if you are a little bit more strong-minded, you just run round the room screaming WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF for about an hour. At least, that's what I did.
 
 
 http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=D5FpADrNcNI 
 
 
The bit in Full Metal Jacket where the film suddenly turns into garbage
 
 
Hmmm. Most of Brazil, probably.
 
 
How about the departed? When all the main characters seem to die in quick succession?
 
 
New Indiana Jones. WTF.

I think the film is impressive enough to be great even if you know what happens.

You have the best signature ever, by the way. Godard is a genius.

Ha, you turned off the film! Definitely watch it, a nice combination of insomnia-creating images and wtf moments  
 
 
Oldboy, Saw and Fight Club
 
 
Ok, I can't find a pic/video, but the bit from Sympathy Mr Vengeance where they're at the riverside, and FOR NO APPARENT REASON AT ALL this strange retarded fellow turns up with his hand stuck in his coat pocket and just wanders around aimlessly, chasing the little girl.

WTF.
 
 
The Machinist, Memento and No Country For Old Men
 
 
The WHOLE production of "A History of Violence" leaves you feeling WTF DID I WATCH THIS **** FILM FOR 2 HOURS?!?!?!??!?!??!??!?!?!??!
 
 
very frequently in borat
 
 
The Lady in the Water. Crappest film I've ever seen.
 
 
The whole of the Matrix

At the end of Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull.

It took 30mins to come to terms with this EPIC FAIL of a movie!

... Aliens ??? HUH ???

Yeah well I've seen it a couple of times and I now understand it, but I was only 10 when I first saw it so I really didn't understand it!! At that age I probably wasn't WTF, more like "I don't understand!"
 
 
When Amelie's mother is killed by the suicidal tourist in Amelie.

And the end of Julia.
 
 
gozu..lol - fecking hilarious though.
 
 
The illusionist wasn't really WTF but more like WOW but in a wtf fashion. That made no sense. So watch it

They escape from a zoo type place. It shows you in a scene near the start I think.

So wtf caused by your lack of attention  
 
 
Oldboy, just.. wtf.

the illusionist was awesome!
i must admit though, the vanishing tree of the travelling illusionist was odd. plus implications through out...it's not as good as the prestige imo.
 
 
yah prestige ftw!

hugh jackman + christian bale=  
also- david bowie in that made me go wtf!!

^ i thought he was a brilliant tesla though... i didnt even notice it was him until the credits.
 
 
The whole of a film I went to see recently:

Burn after reading.

Randomness or what, was still good though, it ended and I said (well shouted actually) WTF was that the end?

Definitely a WTF moment!

 

That's quality!! Haha.  
 
 
Yupp Fight Club I was like wtf?????

My mind just imploded, then it exploded, then I had to glue it together, then rewatch it.

Somebody ruined Oldboy for me. Actually I have to blame myself.

I almost always ask for the twist in the movies; beg, plead and blackmail people into telling me what the "wtf" is. I don't know why  
 
 
The Science of Sleep - it thought it was being artsy and brilliant but it was a major WTF. I turned it off (and I have pretty high pretentious **** tolerance levels).

Also the end of Down With Love. Bad, bad film and total wtf at the end.
 
 
Certainly Monty Pythons Life of Brian and THAT UFO moment qualifies;

 http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=pSY4fEEg4j0 
 
 
It's got to be this:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmOoekbK6YI 
 
 
The ending of the first SAW actually made me get up and say "WTF??!!?".
 
 
The Evil Dead..
Tree Rape!?
And Oldboy is awesome. <3
 
 
The Game.
 
 
On Toy Story the toys can talk WTF!!!
 
 
All the plot, dialogue and songs of The rocky horror picture show.

Pure WTFage.

Come on, a singing tim curry as a 'sweet transexual from transylvania' who lives in a big house with singing wierdos all doing weird dances and singing annoyingly catchy songs and two incestuous servants, creates his perfect man, kills a few people, den turns out to be an alien and the incestuous servants are also aliens who are there to capture/kill tim curry.

Riiiight...
 
 
Everyone forgotten The Sixth Sense?

BRUCE WILLIS IS DEAD!
 
 
I would say when i found out there was no cane in kitizen cane...on the simpsons actually.
 
 
The ending of No Country For Old Men (I hadn't read the book).

Most of Lynch's cinema is like that. The bastard.
 
 
Tyler Durden doesn't
Spoiler:
exist!

Actually I'd love to be able to watch that film for the first time again just for the reaction when you realise that.
 
 
I was WTFing through most of The Village
 
 
Fight club, and the whole of Primer (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film)  )

Primer's a mindf*** of a film, but if you watch it enough times and put the work in to understand it, it's well worth it

espically old boy.

SUPER-wtf moment.

also:

Spoiler:

i didnt get why that dude didnt just get an abortion. instead of throwing his sister off the bridge. i mean it would have made a lot more sense.

edit:

Death Race:

Spoiler:

MOST OF IT. it was like watching a live-action version of a flippin' hot wheels movie.
oh and considering the fact Pachenko went into Jensens house to kill his wife. i'm sure he should have done a runner instead of going back into prison.

I think it was more the shame of ******* his own sister than the actual practicalities of the pregnancy.

I haven't seen it since it first came out, so sorry if I'm wrong but I remember I had to explain the ending to all my friends.

Spoiler:
Basically, the mother and daughter were dead, they were killed at the beginning of the film when their car overturned (i think?) Anyway, they were dead, the father was alive, that's why they couldn't see each other, even when they were in the same room

Please correct me if I'm wrong - it has been a long time since I saw the film!

EDIT - Yeah, i just checked IMDB and I'm completely wrong, surprise surprise!! Oh well, here's the link to the proper answer:  Silent Hill FAQs

Try watching it for the first time wilst drunk as a glass of water in a desert...
 
 
The Usual Suspects, as in WTF was the big deal about this film and how stupid are people to not realise who it was!

The most overrated film I have ever seen.

Also had the misfortune of watching Pirates of the Carribean 2 and 3. Oh dear!
 
 
No one has mentioned Meet Joe Black right at the beginning when Brad Pitt gets Spoiler:

He had that tag band thing on him which is how he was recognised by Jensen.
Wtf on how you watched the movie  
 
 
I think most of us are too young, but apparantly when 'From Dusk til Dawn' was being advertised for cinematic release it was advertised as a crime thriller. The film changes into a Vampire flick, my friend went to see it at the cinema at the time and said everyone was just like WTF?!

The Game- Anyone else a bit like OMG?

My weirdest moment is in The Others when Nicole Kidman finds out that her and her family are....

Spoiler:
DEAD!!!  

I actually said WTF outloud. Mum was like  
 
 
I don't know if this counts but in Titanic when Jack meets Rose at the stairs to go to dinner with her faimly and friends ater he stopped her throwing herself off the ship and he takes her hand, kisses it and says something along the lines of "I saw them do that on Nickelodeon and always wanted to do it""

Hello?! Nick didn't exist when the Titanic went down, I felt like screaming at the telly, apart from that one line I love the film!

I think he meant the Nickelodeon which was a silent movie company in the early 20th century.

Recently - Colin Farrell about to iron a baby in Pride and Glory. Yeah, IRON a ******* BABY! lolz.

In cinema generally....hard to say i'd have to give it more thought.

But IRONING A BABY!? COME ON! Colin ******* Farell!!

True but she's only 15 lol.
 
 
One of my favourite WTF moments, where I actually burst out laughing when it happened.

Battle Royale:

Spoiler:
When Takeshi's character, the old schoolmaster, gets shot, he falls down onto the couch dead. Suddenly, his phone rings, he gets up, answers it - tells his daughter or his wife to STFU, basically, eats a cookie, and with his second-wind's dying breath goes "Lovely cookie" and then dies again.

Or, a moment that just came to my mind, because I WTF'd and am still confused by it.

Jubilee

Spoiler:
Jenny Runacre is playing both a punked-out anarchist, and Elizabeth I. If that's not WTF'd enough - there's a random scene where Toyah Wilcox stabs a police-bod in the balls repeatedly for no real reason. I also had to WTF at the Punk-Rawk "Rule Britannia" as performed by Jordan's Amyl Nitrate character...actually, I think WTF'd at the whole film. Derek Jarman was nuts.

Maybe, judging by WTF-ness, we can include the entire plot of Deadman.

Spoiler:
Johnny Depp in a case of mistaken identity gets chased by three hitmen, meets a fat indian, paints his face a bit, has a few cases of bad memory, and then dies...and it turns out he wasn't even the guy they were after. Watch out for Lars Hendriksen as a nutty-ass civil-war era army nut in with the bounty hunters.

OH - Sh-oo-gar - how could I forget Casshern.

Spoiler:
As with all Sci-Fi, there's not so much a plot as a string of random words thrown together to make one. A guy ends up dead because of a kid who is actually a grenade, but then is brought back to life and put in a suit of mecha-armor. And he's like supercool and ****. But none of it makes any sense, at all. I only love it for the extra-uber-cool fight scene between Casshern and Burai. It's a typical Japanime...even though this is a live-action remake

Thanks for that!   The explainations are a bit strange, might watch the film again.

Oh and another film is Hancock at the ending and the jumping etc
 
 
The ending part of Apocalypse Now when they finally reach Kurtz' stronghold and it just becomes a mountain of WTF
 
 
Stuff by Evan Rachel Wood also get my vote:

Thirteen
Pretty Persuasion

Ick ick ick. Especially when you find out that during filming she is only about a year or so older than the characters she's supposed to be playing.
Thirteen

Pretty Persuasion

 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381505/usercomments 

The reveal in A History of Violence:
Spoiler:
Viggo Mortensen's character really was a former hitman for the Irish mafia. The bit where he kills his brother is a major Wtf moment.
 
 
The first 10/15 mins of Memento, before you could actually work out what was going on.
 
 
Election starring Reese Witherspoon. Spoiler:
Her character Tracy Frick gets away with everything at the end and Matthew Broderick's character goes insane.

Well I thought it was Nick the TV channel but someone just told me that there is a silent movie place called Nickelodeon in the 1900s.

Easily one of my top five films ever. Quentin Tarantino even named his production company after it (A Band Apart), which should be an indication of its brilliance.

Ahhh I love those  
 
 
Get To The Chopper!!!!!
 
 
wtf
 
 
Really? Was I the only one who thought the "twist" in the prestige was fairly obvious? As soon as the words "cloning machine" were mentioned halfway through the film, it was pretty clear what was going on.

I had trouble keeping up in the middle with the flashbacks and everything, but the actual twist at the end I saw a mile off.

When peter parker turned emo and magically became a good dancer  
 
 
The Beast Must Die
IT WAS PAUL FOOT! THERE'S NO *WAY* IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE!!!

Yet somehow it was. Wtf?!
 
 
Also the ending of the matrix trilogy was WTF and when andy dufresne crawled through all that "sewage" in shawshank redepmtion.

Oh and green mile was WTF all the way through
 
 
In one of the Harry Potter movies where the Harry kid was 'crying'. I was just amazed by his sheer inability to act! It was that particular scene which did it for me... I assume the scene was meant to be touching and emotional - I ended up laughing at how ridiculous it was!

The whole Twilight movie.
But nah, there was one scene where his skin was apparently supposed to be different in the sunlight? He came out into the sunlight and... I saw no difference :| The actress was awed and whatnot and I just didn't see it - that was my most recent WTF-ish moment.
 
 
Don't know if it's been mentioned and I cba to go back and check lol.

Awake!

Spoiler:
When Clay went in for surgery and he WOKE UP  ...But couldn't move, so he went into this thing called Aneasthetic Awareness   ******* scary ****. And also when he realises that his wife is actually planning to kill him, along with the docs.
 
 
Shawshank Redemption in that scene when they realise blank is blank.
It's so awesome I dont wanna spoil it.
 
 
The second half of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
 
 
The endings of films always get to me.

Gone With the Wind, American Beauty & Psycho had fairly wtf endings.

Ah that film was so epic. I believe the final line 'Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn   ' was the first time anyone sweared in a picture. Must have been pretty wtf.
 
 
Monster's Ball, when watching it with your parents aged 12/13. The sex scene, I'm sure you know what I mean.
 
 
well I have to agree with whoever said it before. There is nothing stranger than from Dusk til Dawn.
watch the movie without knowing what it's about and you think you accidentally flipped channels

Randomness or what, was still good though, it ended and I said (well shouted actually) WTF was that the end?

 

I think the directors wanted it to end in that kind of anti-climatic fashion. I was left a bit like. WTF? What actually happened in that film?

On a side note, George Clooney was very good in that film.

I know. I liked Mullholland Drive, tried to watch Inland Empire and turned it off after like 30 minutes.
 
 
Can't believe no one has mentioned Litte Miss Sunshine yet. The ending was completely crazy.      
 
 
the ending of indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull

i was so confused
 
 
The ending of the mist anyone, now that ending is ****** up specially since i read the book before watching it so i was expecting a totally different ending not the one in the film lol was effective though hollywood endings get boring after while wont spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.
 
 
Pan's Labyrinth, just the whole film really.
Also Wanted when the rogue agent is revealed to be the main character's father. I know, I know, but I honestly didn't see it coming.   Plus James McAvoy playing a swearing violent sociopath and the whole scene with the rats.  
 
 
Caligula. I stayed up to watch it coz i thought it would help me with my essay. 10 mins later iwas like "WTF IS THIS ****!!!"
 
 
The Others

Spoiler:
i.e. that they trun out to be the ghosts
 
 
I like the WTF moment in Fight Club. Also, Seven had a pretty good ending.
 
 
time bandits
 
 
from dawn till dusk

L'Âge d'Or, Un chien andalou, Blue Velvet and The Idiots. The films were wtf moments.

Blue Velvet is a good shout. Pretty much very single thing that happened was a WTF and even the characters you think seem normal(ish) do completely bizarre things...

Tell me about it, I made the mistake of not really paying attention when watching Mulholland Drive, I have no idea what was going on.

I really wished I didn't read the plot synopsis before watching From Dusk Til Dawn, it gave the change in plot away. I think it would have been better if I didn't know about it.

There's an ever more horrifying scene in Bergman's Cries and Whispers
 
 
David Cronenburg's Crash.   You know, make that the book as well as the film. Just disturbing cinema especially the scene where
Spoiler:
James Spader is having sex with Rosanna Arquette's character at leats that is what you think until you realise he's actually shagging an open wound on her leg. This is a film about people who get turned on by watching scenes of car accidents. Yikes it was a creepy film, couldn't finish watching it.
 
 
also..
the haunted airman
the ending was unexpected, strange and disturbing
 
 
the ending of The Mist..

WTF!!
