The governor of France's central bank, Christian Noyer, has been appointed
chairman of the Bank for International Settlements for the next three years, the
BIS said Monday.

Noyer, 60, succeeds Mexican central bank chief Guillermo Ortiz with immediate
effect, the BIS said in a statement.

Ortiz stepped down as central bank governor at the end of December, thereby
relinquishing his post as chairman of the board of the Basel-based BIS.

The BIS, which groups 56 central banks and monetary authorities, is known as the
central bank of central bankers and has a key role in promoting monetary
stability and monitoring the world economy as well as financial markets.

It can also assist national central banks and international financial
institutions with the management of foreign reserves.
