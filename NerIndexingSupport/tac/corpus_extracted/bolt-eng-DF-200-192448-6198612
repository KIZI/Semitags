Just reading the does Israel exist: I mean should Israel exist   thread and thought it would be interesting to find out once and for all who's side people are on if any?

Given that the ME is a very grey area and it's sometimes hard to see the wood for the trees with all the propaganda from both sides flying about, who do you believe in, who would you put your support behind and why?

Morally, I'm on neither side - Palestinian Nationalism v. Zionism, neither seems particularly pleasant to me.

However I generally do find myself in support of Israel for not being, er, mental.
 
 
Whilst I agree that some Palestinians are a bit fervant I think it's an unfair generalisation to say that they are mental  .

I've met some pretty fervent Israelis on line as well, I didn't think they were mental at all, just well: very angry.

Never met a Palestinian odd that  

I love Peep Show btw

Why wasn't there an option to support both? I support the right of both sides to live safely and to prosper.
 
 
Good point, I've asked a mod to add an option, fingers crossed.  
 
 
Israel. No doubt about it. They may go OTT sometimes, but their values are closer to Britain’s and America’s.

i've met a few living in this country and tbh the word "mental" describes them pretty accurately ime, yet these are supposedly the moderate ones ie the ones not strapping a bomb to themselves and blowing up Israeli buses.

#israel# Israel ftw

Yea I pretty much agree with this. Both sides have concessions to make for peace.
 
 
Palestine, purely because they have been hard done to; America and Britain created this state for the Jews and taken land away from the natives to create Israel.

Why is that a reason to support Israel? The Israeli Government are extremely corrupt just like Britain and America

How?

And to the OP - For most issues I fall on the side of Israel, but I've got a lot of sympathy for the plight of the Palestinian people. The vast majority of the blame for the situation the Palestinians are in is the surrounding Arab states, not Israel.

Don't be a tool - Britain and America are not 'extremely corrupt' by any manner of means: I've bribed enough coloured policemen in foreign climes to give testament to that. Nor is Israel.
 
 
I've cast my vote for Israel, because there is so much bull**** flying around that distorts the context of Israel's existence. Anti-Israelism has become something of a clothes horse for all manner of questionable agendas (not just anti-Semitism). I support it in the sense that I don't denounce its mere existence on moral or political grounds, nor do I find its actions inherently indefensible. When I am speaking of "Palestine" I refer to the region, not to any particular state.

a) Like the Palestinian Authority?
b) Extremely corrupt like the Israeli, US UK government? - care to elaborate given Transparency International ranks the UK as 11th in the world in terms of a lack of corruption, the US as 20th, Israel as 34th while ranking Saudi as 70th Iran as 106th and Indonesia as 130th - all out of 163. Seems like israel, the US and the UK do PRETTY damn well.
 
 
I support both sides, and I sympathise with both of them. Both sides have their flaws, and I think its important for us to remain, or at least been seen by the Palestinians to be as neutral as possible.

However, Israel's Western style, secular, pluralist democracy appeals to me. Also, having Turkish ancestry and the special relationship between Israel and Turkey means that I value Israel very highly.
 
 
Its 13-13 all the moment.

Wonder what would happen if both sets of TSR supporters met on the battleground - maybe we could settle it that way  
 
 
I find it interesting that the supporters of "Palestine" seem rather homogenous in terms of religious views, while israel draws it's supporters from a wide range of people...
 
 
Since you press for an answer, I weigh up the oppressive superstate against the cluster-bombed, impoverished citizens of Palestine, and declare in favour of the Palestinians, but neither group of civilians is to blame, and both groups of civilians are victims.

I think that's a bit of a naive dichotomy.
 
 
In my experience on this board, people who support "neither" may not feel strongly about either side's cause, but have easier sympathy for the Palestinian side. Maybe it's an underdog thing. That, or they know **** all about it  . This is one of those issues I can't help but feel that, the more you learn about it - accurate or not - the pull to sympathise more with one side than the other, becomes impossible to resist. That's not to say it makes one necessarily biased, but the more you know about it, I don't really believe this can be a fencesitting issue. Kind of like religious belief.

Gilliwoo I'm a neither man, but only because I feel neither has a higher moral ground, Palestine gave up theirs when a terrorist first ran into a busy pedestrian area and blew up tens of innocent people. And the Israelis gave up there's when they decided to keep land that wasn't there's by right and to refuse to give it back ad infinitum.

I'm a neither man because I can't find a way of choosing one side over the other as easy as I used to, that came from learning about the situation from seeing Israel's actions over the last 30 years, and where once I was an Israel supporter I now find it's impossible to be so.

I suspect you do have a "side" Sidhe, even if you may not believe that either side is beyond reproach. Having discussed this with you, I strongly suspect you sympathise more with one than the other. Fair enough.
 
 
Not exactly it's just always in discussion I find myself on one side because everyone appears to be on the other. So of course my vigorous defence is going to come across as bias, but I'm really not, I just don't see many threads were people are attacking Israel, when I do though I sometimes find myself defending it, although even then it's usually being rigorously defended by an ardent Zionist or several. Someone's got to stick up for the little guy.

Wouldn't it be more appropriate for the meet to be held in a built up urban environment with Merkavas and RPGs?

And Forever, that picture should be standard issue on this thread. There's nothing like an Israel vs. Pal debate to turn even the most sober debaters into complete asshats.

Does the case of Tom Hurndall's murder pose serious questions about the IDF?

That the soldier was intitially cleared of any charges, but took 2 years of investigation from Tom's father to bring justice?

That the IDF tried tirelessly to cover-up the story?

Would it be ludicrous to suggest that countless of people suffer the same fate as Tom, and countless of IDF soldiers are never brought to justice, but instead are just covered up by the IDF and let free?

Is this an indication of the IDF; soldiers and system?

It has a powerful militaristic ally though. I think you underestimate it's strength oddly enough  

I don't think all that military hardware and technology appeared by divine grace. Much of it came from other countries who at the time supported it, nuclear missile tech from France is a good example.

hehe I don't think even the most militant left wingers are going to add any strength to Palestine. And Thud supports Israel  , of course I meant on TSR, unless there's a subtle   socialist movement I haven't heard about on here undermining the right wing zionist conspiracy, I think those who defend Palestine are **** out of luck

Yes, I can think of one or two... and they're equally in the wrong. Not least the British Empire. The fact is that Israel don't seem in the least interested in bringing a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The ONLY party capable of achieving that is the US diplomatic team, who do not show the slightest inclination to do so.
 
 
Israel is a liberal, modern, reasonably secular democracy. I approve of liberalism, modernism (and Modernism, but that's a completely different matter) and secularism, so I approve of Israel.

The Palestinian territories are a different matter. You know the phrase "flirting with dictatorship"? Well, it's way beyond that. The Palestinians are practically sleeping with dictatorship and extremism, and doing all kinds of obscene/disgusting/interesting/exciting things with them to boot.

As opposed to the Arab nations and the Palestinians who are overly-keen to make peace?

PLEASE....  

Israel has made more effort to make peace than the palestinians have.

I quite agree but if you look at some of the covert and underlying actions of Israel as well as many of the more overt ones it's hard to just say, it's all Palestine and Israel is a gem

Well we can find atrocities on either side, it's just most don't care to look for them.

The Lavon affair springs to mind, and act of terrorism to try and destabilise the diplomacy in Egypt.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair 

Before the days Israel was so eager to not admit fault.

There are a fair few more obvious ones that have already been discussed like Sabrilla and Shatilla and Qibya.

 http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0712-03.htm 

 
Sharon later described his order for "maximal killing" as referring only to the Jordanian military then controlling the West Bank. "Of course, this is misleading nonsense," is Morris' retort. "The order was to kill as many Arabs as possible, without any discrimination between civilians, National Guardsmen, and soldiers."[8]

Morris observes that prior Israeli retaliatory strikes, like this one, were explicitly designed to kill civilians.[9]

Now, Benny Morris is no fan of the Palestinians. He's a committed Zionist who lately has taken to co-authoring commentaries with former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak.[10]

And Qibya was no aberration for Ariel Sharon. A 1985 Israeli biography, Sharon: An Israeli Caesar by Uzi Benziman,[11] describes two earlier incidents in which Sharon honed his murderous instincts.

He killed two women from the Arab village of Katama in order to induce a Jordanian military response.[12] Later, in a raid on the el-Burj refugee camp, his plan called for trapping the Palestinians in a lethal crossfire between two groups of soldiers.

The plan worked: 15 refugees were killed.[13]

Benziman, the biographer, describes Sharon's consistently sadistic behavior toward Arabs: His men "witnessed him laughing as a junior officer tormented an old Arab and then shot him at close range; they noted his composure as he planned operations designed to kill as many civilians as possible; they carried out his intricate plan to trap a peaceful Bedouin boy shepherding his flock."[14]
 

Well cited.

I have more incidents about Sharon, but they've been explained, he did little if nothing to bring peace to the ME, in fact his views have often been considered one of the biggest causes of anti-Israeli sentiment.

It's just not that one sided, but people do believe it is, without knowing the whole story, or should I say more often not acknowledging it because of bias.

Israel isn't perfect. Nobody but a blinkered moron would claim that, and I'm certainly not arguing that liberal, modern, secular democracies have carte blanche to do what the hell they like. But as a kafir and a Gentile I know where I'd rather live, put it that way.
 
 
I don't support Israel but I am not on Palestine side either.

Well fine all I ask is that people understand that there is more under the surface than just a one sided villification, which it appeared you were trying to moot. If it was that simple then Israel would not be as unpopular as it seems to be, and as out of favour with many UN decisions; the UN doesn't do things because it has a bias so strong that it cannot hear Israel, it does it because Israel is so well protected by veto that it doesn't always care to listen. And thus it must continue to be heard, few people understand this, Few very biased people care. It's not directed at you but few people really know the half of it. Works both ways though.

hehe I'm on Palestine's side again I don't mean to be but there's such a slim defence of it.

People are forgetting that Palestine has its own problems at the moment ( Fatah vs. Hamas, Lebanon ) Israel is only increasing it and it isn't helping that the entire West is supporting it mostly out of "guilt" for WO II.

Let me see, does arresting someone affect them? Why yes, yes it does. And so does blocking their route to work, and so does shooting them for coming too close to a security fence, and so does pinning "kick me" notes to their back. It affects them a lot, and see my earlier comment about blinkered morons trying to pretend otherwise.

But wait! Hold the presses! Because firing rockets repeatedly at someone's street might, just possibly, conceivably, affect them a bit too. I'd sure get annoyed. I mean, I got pretty miffed just at the floods, and we weren't even hit that bad.

May I suggest you look harder, and stop seeing only what you want to see. I'll post some tomorrow but I don't have time to now.

The fact is too few defend Palestine and too many including mods are willing to acknowledge this. I think there are way too many people with loud voices and big mouths, that care little to listen or modify view points, to to take constructive criticism or any criticism on board, and thus you have a situation where all you get is Israeli supporters bombarding the threads with their view points. Too many trollfests too little people who are willing to stray into no mans land and suggest it's not all just be black and white. I tried and got labelled as racist, 'nuf said

Compared to Israel, it is. At least, by the criteria I'm using, which are: Economic freedom, social freedom, democratic freedom, respect for the rule of law and the upholding of a moderate-to-high degree of secularity. What are yours?

I've already agreed that that is a strong point for Israel, but Palestine has never been able to develop that way with any ease, because it's so often oppressed. Now I know it isn't without reason, but sometimes the oppression is so vehement and unfair as I pointed out, that they are in a position where they are starved of money, development and any sort of consideration, and this isn't just their fault it's got a lot to do with western and ME action, the last twenty years have set the process back so many years that we're practically at 1966 again.

I blame their non existence in the UN amongst other factors. They just aren't heard and it seems they only will be if they accept what Israel wants, and of course they can't, so it's a catch-22; they want at least their rights back and their land. And they cannot get it. It's not just their fault.

You've got to admit that both sides inflexibility is annoying. But at some point someone has to suggest a compromise both can agree to. And now seems like a fine time. Hamas is Isolated not by clever thought, but by taking Gaza and consolidating there. You can talk to the people that will accept your existence Fatah, and ignore Hamas, it seems almost as if we're on the borders of having for once a government that isn't a nightmare of racist propaganda to deal with, about time.

Well, the question seemed to be implying that the Israelis' actions can, on occasion, cause a spot of bother to the Palestinians. I was acknowledging that this is indeed the case, but pointing out that the Palestinians themselves cause at least as much "bother" to the Israelis.

How would you answer this:

This is an extremely difficult conflict to comprehend let alone solve. For the Palestinians, Israel invaded their home and made it a state without even negotiating it with the people who already lived there. If this happened in Britain, would you be jumping up and down for peace?

Then?

And for the Israeli's, they haven't been able to go any distance of time without fighting defensive wars and protecting themselves since the moment of Israel's creation. If you've been constantly attacked, would you be jumping up and down for peace?

And you've conveniently ignored that fact that negotiations did take place when Israel was being created; until the Palestinians threw the diplomatic efforts out the window and resorted to all out war, which is now why they're in the mess they're in.

No it is a fact that there weren't  . Unless you imply negotiations as forcing the inhabitants to just acknowledge Israel because it is the Israeli people's destiny to return to their holy land. Israel declared itself as an independent state and got immediate recognition from for an example the US. Ignoring the numerous threats to war from countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

In conclusion, it already began as a conflict, then it makes sense that it is a conflict to this day.
 
 
Israel.

Yes, they were. Hence the reason why David Horowitz and Abba Eban went to Palestine to meet Azzam Pasha shortly before the state of Israel was created, asking them to accept the offer of dividing the land between the Jews and the Arabs. The Jews offered a peaceful solution to accommodate all the people living there. Huge amounts of Arabs left the land that was eventually taken by Israeli expansion because the Arab leaders told them they could come back when Israel was destroyed! They were offered a two state solution (Which they seem to want now, ironically) but they chose war instead.

If you want to lay the blame at someones door, laying it at the hands of the one-day old Israeli state is probably not a good idea. Perhaps Jordan, or Syria, or any of the Arab states which make up the vast majority of the Middle East?

For one, I hate it when people only react to 1 part of a post and then remove the other, kind of weak.

Secondly,as an objectivist, surely you must acknowledge that the "negotiatons" weren't as peaceful as the western media said so in the 40's and 50's? I am familiar with the negotiatons however my view on them aren't the same as yours. If you will, you can post the source of your post so I can read it through?

Well, what else would you like me to point out? You said there were negotiations, which I disagreed with - I didn't realise that the origins of Israel and it's "right to exist" were up for debate in this thread - The topic has been done to death - See Lawz thread a few weeks ago entitled "Israel - Should it exist" - If you wish to raise more points about this, I'll be happy to answer them there.

Well of course they weren't: this quote by Pasha highlights this;

"The Arab world is not in a compromising mood. It's likely, Mr. Horowitz, that your plan is rational and logical, but the fate of nations is not decided by rational logic. Nations never concede; they fight. You won't get anything by peaceful means or compromise. You can, perhaps, get something, but only by the force of your arms. We shall try to defeat you. I am not sure we'll succeed, but we'll try. We were able to drive out the Crusaders, but on the other hand we lost Spain and Persia. It may be that we shall lose Palestine. But it's too late to talk of peaceful solutions."

From  here. 

And the source of my post? I'm using my knowledge of the region's history, I can recommend books if you like, but I don't have links or anything...  

Clearly the outcome of the Palestinians were looking for was much better (For them) than the outcome they got after the war in 1948, and it was precisely because of the rejection of the negotiations that the Palestinians have suffered so much (As well as additional blame that can be put on the leaders of Transjordan and the other Arab states). The creation of Israel was going to happen - The Arabs determined how much blood was to be spilled in the process.

Israel has never had a desire to "oppress" - if the palestinians had given up terrorism for more than 10 seconds at a time in the last 45 years, they'd probably find they'd have a lot more freedom to do what they want.

Yes ok, I think we both know there's more to it than that  
 
 
Not really - the old line is still true - if the Arabs put down their guns there would be peace, if the Jews put down theirs, there'd be no more Israel. As true now as it was in 1948.

Look you obsess about the situation you should know enough about it, it's not as simple as trite idioms and you know it.

The Israelis will not accept a deal that gives back the land they took, and the Palestinians will not accept a deal that doesn't offer this, we saw this with Camp David.

The terrorism will continue because they have no other way of fighting; It is the only way you can fight an overwhelmingly superior force, geurilla tactics. Unless you can suggest another method which has the same impact with little or no funding?

Until Israel is willing to give a little it will get nothing. And until Palestine is willing to give a little it will get nothing.

Banal phraseology from 19 dickety x will not solve the problem, it's not a simple matter of guns any more. Now it's got 59 years of extreme hatred to contend with.

Guerrilla tactics would be hit and run attacks on military targets not the indiscriminate slaughter of unarmed civilians.

I didn't realise there was a rule book my mistake  

 
Guerrilla tactics are based on intelligence, ambush, deception, sabotage, and espionage, undermining an authority through long, low-intensity confrontation. It can be quite successful against an unpopular, foreign or local regime, as demonstrated by the Vietnam conflict. A guerrilla army may increase the cost of maintaining an occupation or a colonial presence above what the foreign power may wish to bear. Against a local regime, the guerrilla fighters may make governance impossible with terror strikes and sabotage, and even combination of forces to depose their local enemies in conventional battle. These tactics are useful in demoralizing an enemy, while raising the morale of the guerrillas. In many cases, guerrilla tactics allow a small force to hold off a much larger and better equipped enemy for a long time, as in Russia's Second Chechen War and the Second Seminole War fought in the swamps of Florida (United States of America). Guerrilla tactics and strategy are summarized below and are discussed extensively in standard reference works such as Mao's "On Guerrilla Warfare."[3]
 

Well wiki thinks differently.

 
Guerrilleros must plan carefully for withdrawal once an operation has been completed, or if it is going badly. The withdrawal phase is sometimes regarded as the most important part of a planned action, and to get entangled in a lengthy struggle with superior forces is usually fatal to insurgent, terrorist or revolutionary operatives. Withdrawal is usually accomplished using a variety of different routes and methods and may include quickly scouring the area for loose weapons, evidence cleanup, and disguise as peaceful civilians.[14] In the case of suicide operations, withdrawal considerations by successful attackers are moot ; nevertheless such activity as eliminating traces of evidence, or hiding materials and supplies must be done.
 

 
Civilians may be attacked or killed as punishment for alleged collaboration, or as a policy of intimidation and coercion. Such attacks are usually sanctioned by the guerrilla leadership with an eye towards the political objectives to be achieved. Attacks may be aimed to weaken civilian morale so that support for the guerrilla's opponents decreases. Civil wars, may also involve deliberate attacks against civilians, with both guerrilla groups and organized armies committing atrocities. Ethnic and religious feuds may involve widespread massacres and genocide as competing factions inflict massive violence on targeted civilian population.
 

I think urban geurilla and terrorist are interchangeable terms.

Regardless it doesn't justify it.

Incidentally would those condemning Israel left right and centre like to hazard a guess at which middle easten country provides Palestine with the most humanitarian aid?
 
 
I tend to be in favour of the side that doesn't make it a point of principle to kill large numbers of civilians. I wonder if the people leaping to the defence of terrorist attacks in Israel would show a similar degree of understanding if Iraqi or Afghan militants started blowing themselves up in London.

Israel has been offering Land for Peace deals for decades. The one with Egypt, where the Sinai peninsula was exchanged for recognition and peace, worked; those with the Palestinian Authority have not worked, largely because what little government it has is totally incapable of reining in the terrorists even if it were inclined to try.

Consequently, sooner or later Israeli public opinion is going to cotton on to the fact that Land for Peace deals are only worthwhile if you actually get the peace in return for the land. When that happens Joe Shlomo is going to stop supporting such deals, and indeed deals of any kind, with the Palestinians, and he's going to start seeing the point of view of those such as Lieberman(n?) who advocate harsher courses of action. And trust me, Israel could make things much, much nastier for them if it had a mind to.

Do you not know anything about Camp David? Camp David, if anything, showed that the Israelis ar eperfectly willing to give up the VAST MAJORITY of the land they captured in 1967 in return for a comprehensive peace deal and the end of terrorism. It was the palestinians who walked away without negotiating or making a counter-offer, not the Israelis.

My "other method" would be ending violence - especially considering that it has gotten them nowhere and ALWAYS has far more consequent negative impacts on them than it does on the Israelis. Palestinian terrorism has led to much of the situation they find themselves in today - if they ended it their lot would improve immeasurably.

Israel is willing to give - it has a long history of making heavy concessions and offers for peace. The palestinians have scuppered every deal, every proposal.

From observation over the last few years, I'd say that it's closer to the opposite. On issues like this there has never been a shortage of poorly spelt, factually incorrect, practically incoherent posts attempting to put across the 'Palestinian' argument. Their problem is that they are easilly made to look like idiots by a numerically smaller group of better and more consistant posters, people like Laws, Smith and Jon.

(Above isn't a dig on you, alright   )
 
 
Yes well just because all the mods are on Israels side and have been here for ages and have learnt a thing or two doesn't mean Palestine isn't worth fighting for, I am just sad that no one competent ever posts then  

John H & Agent Smith I'm not going to defend terrorism it's pointless it's a waste of life and it achieves nothing.

I will say this Camp David was blamed by most people except America and Israel and you: on both sides. Really I can site plenty of sources for this. You need to stop reading Zionist propaganda monthly I think.

I can't really comment on this because it's nothing but speculation, I hope your not going to do a I am right you are wrong argument like Bizmarck and claim opinion as fact  

I think a peace deal can be brokered if Israel gives up everything it took post 1950 it would be over, as I say though it is not willing to, and I can see at least some reasons why not, the trouble is if it really wants peace it might have to.

Israel has made things much much nastier it didn't work, it never does, may I suggest you have a very short memory. I mentioned Sharon as the last person to do this a while back, the US refused to veto a resolution on the matter and Israel eventually pulled out, Israel's military actions have reaped nothing but pain really, in the long run. You may argue some were necessary, and true maybe one or two were, however, if they gave the land back then we'd not be having this discussion at all.

I'm impartial JohnH is not.

That makes no sense.

Wiki do you?

 
Reasons for impasse

Both sides blamed the other for the failure of the talks: the Palestinians claiming they were not offered enough, and the Israelis claiming that they could not reasonably offer more. According to The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East, "most of the criticism for [the] failure [of the 2000 Camp David Summit] was leveled at Arafat."[9]

Ehud Barak offered Arafat an eventual 91% (after many years - see section on territory) of the West Bank, and all of the Gaza Strip, with Palestinian control over Eastern Jerusalem as the capital of the new Palestinian state; in addition, all refugees could apply for compensation of property from an international fund to which Israel would contribute along with other countries. But before any gradual Israeli withdrawal, all Palestinian terrorist infrastructure must be dismantled. Arafat, however, refused. The Palestinians wanted the immediate withdrawal of the Israelis from the occupied territories, and only subsequently the Palestinian authority would crush all Palestinian terror organizations. The Israeli response as stated by Shlomo Ben-Ami was "we can't accept the demand for a return to the borders of June 1967 as a pre-condition for the negotiation."[10]

Clinton later stated, "I regret that in 2000 Arafat missed the opportunity to bring that nation into being and pray for the day when the dreams of the Palestinian people for a state and a better life will be realized in a just and lasting peace." [3] According to The Oslo Syndrome, "most of the European states followed Clinton in seeing the Israeli offers as very forthcoming and placing the onus for the summits's failure on Arafat.... Nor did [Arafat's] regime's post-Camp David complaints regarding Israel's not recognizing the Palestinian refugees' 'right of return' win over the Europeans or Americans."[11] The failure to come to an agreement was widely attributed to Yasser Arafat, as he walked away from the table without making a concrete counter-offer and because Arafat did little to quell the series of Palestinian riots that began shortly after the summit.[9][11][12] Arafat was also accused of scuttling the talks by Nabil Amr, a former minister in the Palestinian Authority.[4]

In 2004, two books by American participants at the summit were published that placed the blame for the failure of the summit on Arafat. The books were The Missing Peace by longtime US Middle East envoy Dennis Ross and My Life by President Clinton. Clinton wrote that Arafat once complimented Clinton by telling him, "You are a great man." Clinton responded, "I am not a great man. I am a failure, and you made me one."[13][14]

Clayton Swisher wrote a rebuttal to Clinton and Ross's accounts about the causes for the breakdown of the Camp David Summit in his 2004 book, "The Truth About Camp David" (ISBN 1560256230).[5][6]. Swisher, the Director of Programs at the Middle East Institute, concluded that the Israelis and the Americans were at least as guilty as the Palestinians for the collapse. MJ Rosenberg of the Israel Policy Forum, a think-tank in Washington, praised the book: "Clayton Swisher's 'The Truth About Camp David,' based on interviews with [US negotiators] Martin Indyk, Dennis Ross and [Aaron] Miller himself provides a comprehensive and acute account -- the best we're likely to see -- on the [one-sided diplomacy] Miller describes." [15] Others [7] condemned Swisher's work as neither objective nor accurate.

In the vast majority of Arab world - as well as a small minority of Israeli scholars [8] and a few members of the U.S. negotiating team[citation needed] - it is widely believed that both parties shared responsibility for the deadlock at Camp David.

Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law and noted commentator on the Arab-Israeli conflict Alan Dershowitz said that the failure of the negotiations was due to "the refusal of the Palestinians and Arafat to give up the right of return. That was the sticking point. It wasn't Jerusalem. It wasn't borders. It was the right of return." He claims that President Clinton told this to him "directly and personally."[16]

Professor of political science Norman Finkelstein wrote an article[17] in the winter 2007 issue of Journal of Palestine Studies, excerpting from his longer essay called Subordinating Palestinian Rights to Israeli "Needs". The abstract for the article states: "In particular, it examines the assumptions informing Ross’s account of what happened during the negotiations and why, and the distortions that spring from these assumptions. The article demonstrates that, judged from the perspective of Palestinians’ and Israelis’ respective rights under international law, all the concessions at Camp David came from the Palestinian side, none from the Israeli side."

In his book, The Oslo Syndrome, Harvard Medical School professor of psychiatry and commentator on the Arab-Israeli conflict[18][19] Kenneth Levin summarized the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit thusly: "[D]espite the dimensions of the Israeli offer and intense pressure from President Clinton, Arafat demurred. He apparently was indeed unwilling, no matter what the Israeli concessions, to sign an agreement that declared itself final and forswore any further Palestinian claims."[11] Levin argues that both the Israelis and the Americans were naive in expecting that Arafat would agree to give up the idea of a literal "right of return" for all Palestinians into Israel proper no matter how many 1948 refugees or monetary compensation Israel offered to allow.
 

Clinton famously blamed Israel but the rest of the world generally blamed both. Israel blamed Palestine and vise a versa

"Most people except America and Israel" - so that would be "most people except one of the negotiating parties making the offer and the party that was moderating, facilitating and hosting the talks" - basically "most people except those that were there, involved and know exactly what happened". The facts speak for themselves, there was a generous Israeli offer turned down by Arafat without a counter-offer only a few months before he launched the Second Intifada.

Wishful thinking given that palestinian terrorism began before Israel took the disputed territories and the terror groups are openly committed to Israel's destruction. The capacity for palestinian apologists to brazenly ignore the open stated aims and goals of palestinian groups is ridiculous.

If Israel and Israelis genuinely believed there would be peace they'd probably do it - but the fact is, it's doubtful there would be peace and Israel would have given up its bargaining trips and a strategic advantage for nothing.

Please note the source in the above post and if that doesn't grab you try the citations and if those don't grab you try right wing Zionist militant fortnightly  

More aimed at Agent smith with the Ariel Sharon thing, look up his last incursion into Palestine. I mentioned it recently on a thread Agent Smith was involved in IIRC, so he might remember the details from the UN transcripts he might not.

Clinton didn't blame Israel. And as I point out above - those that were actually there and invovled in the negotiations are in a much better position to know. There's very little running to be made from pointing out what the Arab world (known for having an uneasy relationship with the truth on any subject) and congenital anti-Israel zealots like Finkelstein decided to claim.

So whilst I have that to go on, you'll claim that those aren't impartial and the rantings of Arafat and the Arab world are somehow as valid.

There's no "Palestine" to make an incursion in to. Repeatedly trying to pretend it exists doesn't make it so.

Please can a mod change the voting option to XXX: here be dragons for JohnH    

EDIT: As a matter of interest one of the cited sources got five stars in Amazon, I'm tempted to buy that, apparently it's a real eye opener. The Oslo Syndrome is the name: Kenneth Levin, and it's an in depth account as to why the camp david summit failed. No help here though   but anyway, AAMOI. It's right wing as well, so right up your alley John, it decries liberalism as ruining Israel

Read the accounts from people who were actually THERE, rather than those who weren't but have tried to push the idea that Arafat wasn't to blame anyway.

Why does that something have to be wrong - why don't you pick a more valid term?

Past history has seen palestinian "society" become pretty much the most deranged, terrorist-infested, hate-indoctrinating, child-brainwashing bunch in the world today. Any country dealing with a society which wraps itself in terrorism as essentially it's defining characteristic is going to have a lot of issues.
 
 
Anyway, once again your own wiki source has the following:

"The failure to come to an agreement was widely attributed to Yasser Arafat, as he walked away from the table without making a concrete counter-offer and because Arafat did little to quell the series of Palestinian riots that began shortly after the summit.[9][11][12] Arafat was also accused of scuttling the talks by Nabil Amr, a former minister in the Palestinian Authority.[4]"

And that is followed up by both Clinton and Ross blaming Arafat. All that's produced to combat this are claims by Swisher and Finkelstein - neither of whom were at the talks and both of whom are well known for being staunchly anti-Israeli.

Whilst you may see this as some sort of "six of one" debate - it really isn't - it's the people involved, Clinton, Ross, etc. vs. uninvolved anti-Israel zealots who will try anything to shift the blame.
 
 
Er one of the citations is from a right wing American? Hardly think it's biased now do you? If anything he's pro Israel. Now if you wont accept the sources we have nothing to discuss, au revoir.

Oh for christ sake stop cherry picking; that clearly attributes the fault to both sides as well, it has all the opinions, if your not even going to read the thing then there really is little point in talking about this.

I think it's clear though that a number of Israelis or Jews blaming both sides is quite an indictement against it being one sides fault or the other : no?

There's little point in talking about it solely because the answer was then, is now and always has been obvious except to the Arabs and their anti-Israel supporters. Fault is NOT attributed to both sides - the only ones that don't place it on Arafat are the Arabs and those with a long history of anti-Israel writing - your pathetic attempts to make it seem like the truth must lie somewhere in the middle does not stand up to even minimal scrutiny.

There's little point in talking about it solely because the answer was then, is now and always has been obvious except to the Arabs and their anti-Israel supporters. Fault is NOT attributed to both sides - the only ones that don't place it on Arafat are the Arabs and those with a long history of anti-Israel writing - your pathetic attempts to make it seem like the truth must lie somewhere in the middle does not stand up to even minimal scrutiny

No - that's a ridiculous argument given that it's well known that some of the most fervently and rampantly anti-Israel figures out there are Jews - Finkelstein and Chomsky being prime examples. People like that trying to shift the blame on to Israel have no more credibility than the Arabs trying to do the same.

Yes, he's pro-Israel...

But at what point does he blame Israel for the break-down of CAmp David - read what Wiki says!

"[D]espite the dimensions of the Israeli offer and intense pressure from President Clinton, Arafat demurred. He apparently was indeed unwilling, no matter what the Israeli concessions, to sign an agreement that declared itself final and forswore any further Palestinian claims. "[11] Levin argues that both the Israelis and the Americans were naive in expecting that Arafat would agree to give up the idea of a literal "right of return" for all Palestinians into Israel proper no matter how many 1948 refugees or monetary compensation Israel offered to allow."

He clearly puts the blame on Arafat - only noting that the Israelis and Americans were NAIVE to expect that Arafat would actually make a deal that Israel could possibly accept. I think you've badly misinterpreted his point - he's clearly putting the blame for the failure of Camp David squarely on Arafat.
 
 
 
In his book, The Oslo Syndrome, Harvard Medical School professor of psychiatry and commentator on the Arab-Israeli conflict[18][19] Kenneth Levin summarized the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit thusly: "[D]espite the dimensions of the Israeli offer and intense pressure from President Clinton, Arafat demurred. He apparently was indeed unwilling, no matter what the Israeli concessions, to sign an agreement that declared itself final and forswore any further Palestinian claims."[11] Levin argues that both the Israelis and the Americans were naive in expecting that Arafat would agree to give up the idea of a literal "right of return" for all Palestinians into Israel proper no matter how many 1948 refugees or monetary compensation Israel offered to allow.
 

This is the bit where his opinion is given Kenneth Levin?

Will you read the thing entirely without your shades that filter out anything that is troubling to you?

He thinks it failed because Yarafat was told by Clinton he would never get the right to return he had wanted.

Israel can't be expected to allow the refugees to return to Israel proper, they should go to the Palestinian state once it is established.

Indeed, but it's never going to be changed by people who know quite a bit less about a particular subject than I do. And when it comes to debating this particular conflict on TSR, that's damn near almost everyone. Even some of those that don't agree with me will tell you I'm one of the best informed and most knowledgeable people about the topic around here.

When the "evidence" is pathetic and I can show it to be so, why should it alter my perspective? If all that can be produced to counter the personal accounts and accepted view is the rantings of anti-Israel zealots who weren't there, am I actually supposed to take such challenges seriously?

So Israel cannot absorb the small numbers of refugees? Yes that would be a nightmare I agree.  

Anyway it's clear both sides had preconceived ideas of what they would accept and both sides weren't ready to meet them. That I think is clear. Although you can beg to disagree I'd like to see some sources though. I've given one who is obviously pro-Israel who claims that it was both sides fault.

John yes your God, your obsessive you need to go outside of politics and realise there's more to TSR though.

I'm sure if I just spent all my time here I'd be a god by now. Anyway it's clear you wont even accept pro-Israeli sources, which makes no sense to me, so this discussion is pointless. I have to go make dinner  
 
 
A lot of people seem to be getting confused by this poll. In forcing people to choose between a limited number of options, it necessarily distorts reality somewhat. For instance, those who favour the Israelis but by no means hate the Palestinians appear in the same category as the most extreme Israeli nationalists, namely the category of people voting "Israel".

And a lot of people seem to have overlooked this fact, and are assuming that everyone who voted for Israel is against the Palestinians. This is not the case.

See, you clearly don't understand the issues under discussion. Arafat may well have been told that he couldn't expect a full palestinian "right of return" - but that much has ALWAYS been known to everyone involved, because any such agreement would demographically DESTROY Israel. No Israeli government could ever posisbly accept such an arrangement, it would be national suicide - the Israelis know it, the Americans know it, the palestinians know it, everyone knows that. So the fact that Arafat still tried to make that demand and refused to negotiate without it being met - despite knowing that Israel could not possibly capitulate - means that he went to Camp David with no intent of actually reaching a deal. Indeed, what Levin is saying is that Arafat caused the downfall of the talks by making an impossible demand and refusing to negotiate it.

It's not a small number. The palestinians want a "right of return" for ALL palestinians - combine that number with the number of Arabs already in Israel and Israel loses it's Jewish majority - if not immediately then within a couple of years due to high Arab birth rates. Come on, if you don't know this sort of basic stuff why are you trying to debate the topic?

Untrue. Israel was ready to deal and concede a lot of land albeit in stages. Arafat made an impossible demand - one he knew for a fact that no Israeli leader could ever accept - and then refused to negotiate on it.

No you haven't! Levin does NOT say that it was both sides fault - that is a complete and total misinterpretation and misrepresentation of what he says. I have pointed that out to you. The fact you're still claiming that is what he said means you do not understand his point and are either not listening to what I am saying or are lying through your teeth.

But I'll leave you with this, the fact is the US were naive to believe that he'd give up this point, they knew he had mooted this from the start but falsely believed he would somehow give up this point when he was resolved of it.

I disagree it would not be suicide, People would not just suddenly make a run for the border, and 6 million Arabs wouldn't up sticks and leave Palestine empty. They could soundly have argued for a right to return with stipulations, they wanted him to abandon any idea of any return at all this is stupidity, no wonder he didn't agree, they were thinking he'd give up major points and contentions without discussion.

Ok right that's one of the sources, now the other ones if you please. There is a split there and you can't assert that you are right because of conflicting opinions.

 
Clayton Swisher wrote a rebuttal to Clinton and Ross's accounts about the causes for the breakdown of the Camp David Summit in his 2004 book, "The Truth About Camp David" (ISBN 1560256230).[5][6]. Swisher, the Director of Programs at the Middle East Institute, concluded that the Israelis and the Americans were at least as guilty as the Palestinians for the collapse. MJ Rosenberg of the Israel Policy Forum, a think-tank in Washington, praised the book: "Clayton Swisher's 'The Truth About Camp David,' based on interviews with [US negotiators] Martin Indyk, Dennis Ross and [Aaron] Miller himself provides a comprehensive and acute account -- the best we're likely to see -- on the [one-sided diplomacy] Miller describes." [15] Others [7] condemned Swisher's work as neither objective nor accurate.

What you're basically saying is that the US were naive to think that Arafat ever intended to negotiate in good faith and aim for a workable solution - rather than going through a charade of negotiations and deliberately scuppering them with a demand that couldn't possibly be met. Whilt there is US naivety, the fault still clearly lies with Arafat.

It would leave Israel entirely open to be demographically destroyed at the will of the palestinians as and when they wanted. You may not see that as suicide - allowing someone who wants to destroy you the opportunity to do so - everyone else does see that as suicidal.

There isn't a split. There's Ross, Clinton and widely accepted opinion versus, basically, Swisher and Finkelstein - and 5 seconds of research on either of those will show their long records of anti-Israeli views. Your attempt to portray this as an equal debate with equality of arguments on either side is manifestly dishonest.

You can't just say that as if it's true John, source please.

And I'd like you to have a stab at either answering the wiki sources that conflict with your opinion or admit that this is far from a done deal.

Internet polls are generally pretty meaningless; don't get hung up on them I wont be   it's just an interesting thing for me to see that there are many Palestinian supporters but few people willing to stand up for them, so it's left to somone like me who is a neither man, very strange?

Your own source says as much - it's in fact pathetic that it's trying so hard to make it look like there's a debate where there isn't.

The only sources are Finkelstein and Swisher - and given their records and how their "views" diverge from those "in the know" and from what is generally acknowledged I'm not going to waste my time debunking their baseless anti-Israel claims. It is a done deal - the truth about Camp David is well known, those other "sources" are no better than revisionists trying to rewrite history.

Here's a reply to Swisher that I found demonstrating just how partisan he is and just how desperately he is tyring to blame-shift:  http://www.peacewithrealism.org/pdc/swisher.htm

It's not strange, it's entirely expected. "Palestine" is supported by legions of Muslims despite their being far too ignorant and/or stupid to take part in a debate on the topic that wouldn't result in their being absolutely shredded. It's the option of the ill-informed.
 
 
A middle East think tank, and I can show you which one, if you like praised them a few anonymous zionists said he was wrong, you'll have to do better than that to discredit this source and as you know there are more, kindly tell me why the opinions here are better than an American think tank?

Your argument falls apart simply for how little support there is for it. You're actually pushed to finding random people and odd think-tanks to support the idea you're pushing because it is not what is accepted and because everyone in the know doesn't agree with them. Different think tanks think different things - having one supporting that side doesn't mean it must be right. The fact you're pushed to the point where you're like "oo, I found someone to back it up!" demonstrates just how much this is an attempt to manufacture a debate where there really isn't one.

This is just opinion, if your such a God, you post some sources then. I've posted them and backed them up, you've said they are bunk in your opinion, and it has only been in your opinion, without doing anything to discredit them at all accept saying they must be wrong then some random Jews said they were  

You claim victory yourself, you can't do that, if others all swarm forward and say you win, then maybe I'd take your over inflated opinion of your victory seriously.

Do you see?

This is not just "favouring topics" - I count over 20 Muslims who haven't posted in D&D more than a couple of times since January who now pitch up to vote.

And it matters if you want to look at who the informed, knowledgeable debaters back and who the uninformed, unintelligent massed ranks of Muslims back.

One contributor doesn't make up for the clear editorial line of the Indy as an anti-Israel one. You think the Guardian employing David Aaronovitch (pro-Iraq war, pro-Israel) makes the Guardian either of those things?!

As I point out above, the Guardian employs David Aaronovitch - someone who strongly supports the Iraq War. So does that mean the Guardian now backs the Iraq War?

Wow, I didn't think my opinion of your intelligence could sink much further, I guess you proved me wrong.

Given that by far the most read story is the title story, it seems irrelevant that the Indi gives a forum for the expression of pro-Israeli views in latter pages, as the front page (and generally the first few pages) will tend to contain far more material portraying Israel in a negative light.

That said, I do think Israel's actions tend to be more newsworthy than those of her enemies (and no, I don’t strongly support either side).

Back up your opinion or leave the field.

Now I don't think someone who had so much to lose as Clinton is going to blame himself for the failiure now do you? And Ross was a diplomat working in the US camp, again of course they would say that it covers the blame for their performance. Ros now works for Fox news, were his bias is no doubt encouraged, Fox News is a joke amongst real journalists  

If they won peace it's their fault if they lost it's Palestines, cmon.

Sources, this is clearly and I showed with the review by the MEI citation which you couldn't read nor see that that book was critically acclaimed by a solid and reputable organisation.

Honestly I'm beginning to doubt your claim of being so good, because your also a lazy debater who relies solely on opinion.

Sources please doesn't have to be wiki then other sources, were did you get your opinion from, or did it just arrive at you by assumption. Who says that it wasn't both sides fault apart from ardent Zionists? I even showed you someone who said it was the fault of all because of unreasonable expectations to begin with, and you dismissed that valid point.

AAMOI, the Palestinians did and still do consider the right of return as sacred. I don't think letting them return will overwhelm Israel unless they all return with guns. But obviously Israel does and thinks such an ingress will be the death of Israel.

So talks are and were in hindsight in fact pointless, because of irational fears rather than reality though.

The fact you cannot understand this means you must be an idiot. I repeat, from YOUR source:
""The failure to come to an agreement was widely attributed to Yasser Arafat, as he walked away from the table without making a concrete counter-offer and because Arafat did little to quell the series of Palestinian riots that began shortly after the summit. Arafat was also accused of scuttling the talks by Nabil Amr, a former minister in the Palestinian Authority."

See that? Widely attributed - as in, most people are of that opinion. So your attempts to claim I am relying solely on "my opinion" is just a deceitful and dishonest claim - a pattern of them from you is now emerging.

As I said before - everyone in the know, who was involved in the talks, you will try to dismiss as biased and you'd rather listen to congenital Arab liars and anti-Israel zealots like Finkelstein.

No, I'm not relying solely on opinion. I am relying on whnat is ACCEPTED (see above), whilst you are acting like a moron and claiming that I need to back up a view that your own source clearly states is the widely accepted one. It's pathetic how badly you fail to understand this.

OK, you are a liar. There is no other way to describe this. You cited someone and claimed that is what they said - I clearly refuted that and pointed out he was NOT blaming both sides and that it is clear to anyone who knows about the conflict that he is blaming Arafat. Your continuing insistence that he was blaming both sides - despite your not refuting my point at all - is just lying. I don't deal with someone who repeatedly lies to my face like you do - if you cannot debate honestly without lying repeatedly even once your lies have been exposed, then there really is no point talking to you.

Either be honest and stop repeatedly lying once I have pointed out your interpretation of someone's statement is bizarre and incorrect or move on.

You are lying repeatedly on two points:
1. Your trying to claim that my side is only supported by "my opinion" - a bizarre and idiotic claim, given that I have repeatedly pointed out that my side is openly identified (even by your source) as widely accepted opinion and is backed up by those such as Ross and Clinton who were actually involved heavily in the talks. It is not "my opinion" - it is the opinion of those involved and basically the majority of those who witnessed and paid attention to the talks at the time.
2. Your idiotic claim that Levin is "blaming both sides" - when anyone with a baisc knowledge of the conflict and ability to interpret the English language can see that he is placing the blame squarely on Arafat's unwillingness to negotiate in good faith.

Until you stop lying and deceiving repeatedly on both those points, I really don't care what you have to say because you have no credibility.

Sources, this is clearly and I showed with the review by the MEI citation which you couldn't read nor see that that book was critically acclaimed by a solid and reputable organisation.

Honestly I'm beginning to doubt your claim of being so good, because your also a lazy debater who relies solely on opinion.

Sources please doesn't have to be wiki then other sources, were did you get your opinion from, or did it just arrive at you by assumption. Who says that it wasn't both sides fault apart from ardent Zionists? I even showed you someone who said it was the fault of all because of unreasonable expectations to begin with, and you dismissed that valid point.

AAMOI, the Palestinians did and still do consider the right of return as sacred. I don't think letting them return will overwhelm Israel unless they all return with guns. But obviously Israel does and thinks such an ingress will be the death of Israel.

So talks are and were in hindsight in fact pointless, because of irational fears rather than reality though.

The right of return is a sham. It is a fairytale and all those palestinian refugees who aren't allowed to hold jobs, eneter into higher education or have any sort of quality of life (the ones in lebanon and syria - NOT the ones in israel) somehow believe that it is israels fault that these arab states are opressing them - and the arab states fan the flames! it is pathetic! There is no right of return. Even the UN reso says, 'return in peace'. Well seeing as the palestinians voted in Hamas, and many (well a significant minority, at least) support violence against israel, i see absolutely no way in which israel could let in any refugees.

At the end of the day, israel has a right to secure borders and israel has the right to deny entry to anyone it wants, just as every other country in the world does. Here is an interesting solution to the refugee problem, what's even more interesting is who suggested it:

 
A Sensible Solution
to the Refugee Problem
by Carlos

April 17, 2007 - No issue in the Israel/Palestinian conflict is more controversial than the question of the Palestinian refugees. Each side considers the other's position to be a deal-breaker. The Palestinians demand a "just solution" to the refugee problem, which to them would take the form of compensation plus a "right of return" of all Palestinians to the homes they (or actually their ancestors) lost, which would now be situated within the State of Israel. Israel objects that such an arrangement would upset the demographic balance and turn Israel into a de facto Palestinian state. This would defeat the whole purpose of partition, which is to allow self-determination for both Jews and Palestinian Arabs.

I recently came across a proposed solution to the refugee dilemma that struck me as so sensible that I thought it worth quoting extensively. Here is how it begins:

It is patently obvious that uprooting the descendents of the refugees from their current homes in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and other countries, and returning them to Israel, to the West Bank, and to Gaza is a utopian ideal and [a recipe for] anarchy. More than that - it is an idea that cannot be implemented, not only because it will upset the demographic [balance] in a dangerous and destructive manner, and will have [far-reaching] political, economic and social ramifications in such a small and constrained geographical area, but [mainly] because the return [of the refugees] stands in blatant contradiction to Israel's right as a sovereign [state], while the Palestinian Authority lacks the infrastructure to absorb such a large number of immigrants as long as the peace process... is not at its peak.
The writer clearly recognizes the difficulties. The major population shift that the right of return would create would overwhelm both Israel and the new Palestinian state.

But what about the problem's origins?

Clearly, the refugee problem is mainly the result of cumulative mistakes made by the countries where [the refugees] live... such as Syria and Lebanon, which have isolated the refugees in poor and shabby camps lacking the most basic conditions for a dignified human existence. Instead of helping them to become fully integrated in their new society, they let them become victims of isolation and suffering... Later, the worst of all happened when Arab intelligence agencies used the Palestinian organizations as a tool for settling scores in internal Arab conflicts that probably have nothing to do with the Palestinians.
We can leave aside for now the fact that the refugee problem resulted from the war in 1948, which was initiated by the Palestinian Arabs themselves and the armies of five Arab states. The countries in which the refugees now live did not integrate them into their societies and make them citizens with equal rights. Instead they maintained them in refugee camps, where the living conditions are very poor.

The Jews also had a refugee problem, as the number of Jews expelled from Arab countries was roughly equal to the number of Palestinian refugees. Israel's response to the Jewish refugee crisis was very different:

The Israelis, on the other hand, were civilized and humane in their treatment of the thousands of Jewish refugees who had lost their property, homes and businesses in the Arab countries, and who were forced to emigrate to Israel after the 1948 war. The Israeli government received them, helped them, and provided them with all the conditions [they needed] to become integrated in their new society.
Israel accepted the Jewish refugees and made them full citizens. Therefore the Jewish refugees do not demand a right of return.

So what should be done to solve the Palestinian refugee problem?

The Arab countries where the Palestinians live in refugee camps must pass the laws necessary to integrate the inhabitants of these camps into society. [In addition, they must] provide them with education and health services, and allow them freedom of occupation and movement and the right to own real estate, instead of [continuing] their policy of excluding [the refugees] and leaving the responsibility [of caring for them] to others, while marketing the impossible illusion of return [to Palestine].
It seems right and just that the host Arab countries do no less for the Arab refugees than Israel did for the Jewish ones. It is not right that those refugees be kept in substandard living conditions, exploited by their hosts for political purposes. Israel did not do that. Israel already shouldered its share of the burden. It is time for the Arab countries to do likewise. This is what justice demands:

There is a growing necessity for a realistic, unavoidable and bold decision that will provide a just solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees by naturalizing them in the host countries, such as Syria, Lebanon, and other countries.... By every conceivable and accepted criterion, naturalizing the refugees [in the Arab countries] is the inevitable solution to [this] chronic humanitarian problem.
The problem of the Palestinian refugees has been a major stumbling block in the peace process for many years. This plan to solve the refugee problem is fair and just. It deserves to be taken seriously. It deserves international backing.

The author of this plan? Saudi columnist Yousef Nasser Al-Sweidan, writing in the Kuwaiti daily Al-Siyassa, March 5 and March 16, 2007.

Jonathan stop throwing your toys out of the pram and calm down.

Ok I'm a big fat liar and your back on ignore  

Everyone's happy.

Look it's clear that although there is an accepted view, those outside of Israel and the US and many inside it don't buy it I've showed that.

So peace can never be achieved because of Israeli's unwillingness to accept refugess.

And Israel is a shining beacon of light, yes we've heard all this before.

I suggest if people can't accept that this isn't an open and shut case, and that a fair amount of lies have been passed off by diplomats then there's no point in talking about it.

What you don't seem to understand is the following:

-The 'right of return' to israel of all refugees is not a negotiable option - it cannot happen because it creates a de facto palestinian state and annihilates israel, giving one side exactly what they want and another exactly what cannot happen.

-Arafat knew that israel COULD NOT accept a right of return as a precondition for peace.

-Once there is a viable palestinian state, which all refugees could move to. There is no longer a refugee problem and with a state, the refugees would have no need to go to israel.

I'd like to quote you a few things

now THAT sums up why the right of return is a pathetic solution. I'll repeat again: Arafat knew that the right of return was a fallacy yet he came to Camp David knowing that he'd throw the cards off the table unless that was granted.

IMO, it wouldn't surprise me if the palestinians would be happy with not getting a new state established and JUST getting the right of return....
 
 
Did you read my sources, that is not there opinion and neither do I think the right of return would anihilate Israel again that is diplomatic conjecture and has no basis in reality.

Historically even huge influxes of refugees have only overwhelmed a country if an outside power forced it's will on a weaker one(aka partition plan) These are civillians not crack Geurillas.

It seems to me that Israel is saying they could not accept something for conjectural reasons therefore ergo Arafat knew he would be refused therefore he came to the table unwilling to negotiate. This is nothing but conjecture based on conjecture based on conjecture and it's a dissapointingly weak straw man.

It'd be far easier to make the case that both sides were guilty of being naively hopeful than that one sides motivation was deeply set in stone before talks even began which is not a widely held view at all.

If they knew Arafat wouldn't deal why the hell did they turn up, one big publicity stunt?

Hmm I'm sure that happened before somehwere?  

 

I read your sources - that WAS their opinion (or at least, i interpreted it that way).

I suppose it depends on what you mean by annihilate israel. If you think it means kill every israel in sight, then, no i do not believe that israel would be a niihilated.

What i meant by annihilate israel was that it would no longer be a jewish state with a jewish minority, it would no longer be a country that world jewry can look to for support when they need it, israel (as a jewish state) would be annihilated. As soon as it was, the economy would crash (due to the fact that every jewish business on the planet who invest in israel would pull out), every jew who owns buildings i israel would knock them down and there would be mass emigration - of course all of this is exactly what the palestinians want when they ask for a 'right of return'.

No, what you've shown is that Arabs and their apologists don't buy it. Widely accepted opinion is not just the US and Israel.

That is such a ridiculous "analysis" of the situation that it beggars belief. What you term "unwillingness to accept refugees" - is actually "unwillingness to be demographically destroyed and cease to be a Jewish State" - but we've already established you're a liar so another attempt at deceit is not unexpected.
 
 
The highest estimates of influx I've seen which IMHO are exaggerations put the figures at 800,000 to 1,000,000

That would create a Palestinian majority would it?

Israel's population has been predicted at 60,000,000 by the millenium maybe we could wait till then  

This excuse is poor let's face it, with Israel's growing population figures, that exaggeration will soon become completely meaningless.

If nothing else it just shows that politicians are stuck in the past and not visionaries and they claim a hopeless situation without looking forward. Stupidity really isn't it?

no i think they want the israelis to leave all the businesses and buildings and generally all the other modern progressive adjustments they've made to the area so the palis can bequeath of the world one more oppressive women-hating state but this time with decent infrastructure.

  Thud that sounds like an excerpt from a propaganda flyer.

Er I don't think that's quite what was born in mind.

More like integration than anihilation was mooted.

Your wish is my command. I'll leave it for an hour and then come back see what's cooking...
 
 
yeah i should turn it into one and start giving it out outside my student union seeing as j-soc refuse to do so.

Only someone without ANY understanding of the conflict and such issues would make such an absurd and incorrect statement.
The fact is, if you add the palestinian population and the Arab population of Israel there is not a lot in it between the total and the Jewish population of Israel. Add in the fact that the Arab birth-rate is considerably higher than the Jewish one - and any Jewish majority would be wiped out in short order.

Arab birth rates are significantly higher than Israeli Jewish ones. As time moves on, the situation gets demographically worse for Israeli Jews, not better.

This is the main difference between me and you on this issue.

Your exaggeration aside, I think the Israelis cause much more than a "spot of bother" to the Palestinians, which in turn causes the Palestinians to react. I think what Israelis do to the Palestinians largely determine what the Palestinians do back. I think that the majority of Palestinian retaliation stems from Israeli violence towards them.

It is by no means one way, but people don't properly take into consideration the effects of what Israeli violence towards Palestinians has.

People consider (or not) this factor way too lightly. Sure, there are other factors that affect what Palestinians do, but I think this is the main one. This also includes humiliation, demolishing homes and so on.

For example, the  Beit Hanoun massacre  ; obviously Israel say it was an accident and they "expressed regret for the civilian deaths and says it is investigating the incident." - but I'm not questioning whether it was an accident or not - that's irrelevant in this post. I want you to consider the Palestinian point of view.
Would you for a second think that any Palestinian living in Beit Hanoun ever considered it to be an accident? Also consider how many "accidents" Israel have made towards Palestinians, as this affects how Palestinians think of such incidents. Apply this to any other people, would one enemy consider the same incident an accident if they experienced the same thing from their enemy (time and time again)? How angry do you think the Beit Hanoun massacre made other Palestinians ( especially to those who lost family members/close friends)? Leading on from the last point, would you rule out any retaliation stemming from this incident (or similar incidents), at all? I don't want you to totally base your answer around my example, but to focus more on the points before it.

If you're examining causation, I invite you to look at who started every major war within this conflict except for the 1956 Suez Crisis. Including the '67 War, the results of which are still perhaps the most contentious issues within the entire conflict.

Also, think about this logically. If the Palestinians didn't keep trying to ferment terrorism, and indeed elect a terrorist government, then Israel would have no justification for going into the West Bank and pursuing the courses of actions which she does. I'm not for one moment condoning the actions of those Israelis who participated in this massacre, because clearly this was a terrible occurence; however, Israel would not be on constant alert for terrorist actions (which creates the possibility of awful events such as these happening occassionally) if the Palestinians actually renouned their violence and decided to seek more peaceful means of conflict resolution.

I don't believe that Israel has any deliberate intention to "oppress" Palestinians per se. The problem is that if your neighbour elects a government who refuse to explicitly accept your legitimacy then it's difficult to treat them with a light touch. If you compare the experience of Israeli Arabs (who have obviously accepted the presence of Israel) to those of the Palestinians, I think this demonstrates the point aptly.

I put it to you that Palestinian action is not as a result of Israeli oppression (though the supposed presence of this may now further fan the flames) but merely because Palestinians object to the very presence of Israel within the region. I think the response of the Hamas spokesman further down in the BBC article really says it all.

"Israel should be wiped from the face of the Earth. It is an animal state that recognises no human worth. It is a cancer that should be eradicated,"
 
 
I wouldn't take what Hamas says seriously if I was you, no one outside of Palestine does anyway.

I can put up hate filled racist Zionist propaganda as well if you'd like and claim that it represented anything but drivel  

Fatah are the only people the Israelis will talk to, and in fact they now have a chance to with Hamas Isolated so neatly. Clearly with the power swinging back to Fatah, it would be better to put up a quote of a government more in control of Palestine, than Hamas. Fatah is willing to concede Israel's right to exist.

You like to make out that when people use certain sources to back a point, they must be bigots, and their sources inaccurate. To you, anybody who takes a certain line with regards to Israel is a "Zionist". And yes, not all Zionists (nor "Zionists") spout drivel.

Your reading things into what I said that don't exist: AdamTJ, I do not think you are a bigot I clearly only think the Hamas jack ass is  

Just the facts thanks, not your psychoanalysis of my motivation if we could.

No just the stuff that was banned from the UN, not all zionist rhetoric is nonsense, just the nationalistic stuff generally.

If you don't like me pointing out valid information and saying that what Hamas thinks is redundant, there is an ignore option.

I did attack Hamas here? I don't know why your so antsy, I was merely pointing out that both sides have their idiots, what's wrong with that?

Perhaps you should say that to the Israelis who until the recent internecine violence were constant targets of rockets fired by organisations like Hamas.

The difference is, those who spout hate filled racist Zionism are known to be a fringe lunatic minority, who have no real power to actually practise what they preach. Hamas on the other hand clearly enjoy widespread support amongst their people and have regularly targeted Israeli civilians.

Clearly the EU and US take them seriously enough- indeed they both consider Hamas an out and out terrorist organisation, and have refused aid to the P.A. until they recognise Israel and renounce violence. So in effect, what you are saying, to be blunt is actually a lie.

So can i.

The difference is the racist zionist blablabla are either isolated comments or comments from those groups that are so marginalised they hardly exist!

The palestinian racist blablabla comes from those who are in power (ie Hamas, who were elected) and is in their charter, the PLO charter etc etc

ALSO, i wouldn't write of Hamas - they have a lot fo support in the palestinian community for one reason or another, marginalising them will only make the inevitable even worse....We're not looking at a 3-state solution and hopefully never will!

FINALLY: Can some1 answer me this: Why are the palestinians now having a go at Israel because the EGYPT-gaza crossings are closed? Is this not egypts fault? or have i missed something?

Perhaps now- but the mere fact that the Palestinians were willing to elect a government with such ideals behind it speaks volumes about their attitude.

It is by no means one way, but people don't properly take into consideration the effects of what Israeli violence towards Palestinians has.

People consider (or not) this factor way too lightly. Sure, there are other factors that affect what Palestinians do, but I think this is the main one. This also includes humiliation, demolishing homes and so on.

For example, the  Beit Hanoun massacre  ; obviously Israel say it was an accident and they "expressed regret for the civilian deaths and says it is investigating the incident." - but I'm not questioning whether it was an accident or not - that's irrelevant in this post. I want you to consider the Palestinian point of view.
Would you for a second think that any Palestinian living in Beit Hanoun ever considered it to be an accident? Also consider how many "accidents" Israel have made towards Palestinians, as this affects how Palestinians think of such incidents. Apply this to any other people, would one enemy consider the same incident an accident if they experienced the same thing from their enemy (time and time again)? How angry do you think the Beit Hanoun massacre made other Palestinians ( especially to those who lost family members/close friends)? Leading on from the last point, would you rule out any retaliation stemming from this incident (or similar incidents), at all? I don't want you to totally base your answer around my example, but to focus more on the points before it.

 

I'm well aware that from the Palestinian point of view, Israel's actions do indeed lead to - and justify - all kinds of actions on the part of various Palestinian groups. But the average Palestinian in the street is not in possession of all the facts. No indeed. He is in possession of maybe a fact or three, if he's lucky, but these will be supplemented and/or submerged by a torrent of propaganda and misinformation from his government.

Possibly the Israeli forces in Gaza still control those crossing-points. Not sure.

What it does say is that if Israelis vote in a hard line racist Zionist, then Palestinians will vote in hard line racist anti-zionists.

I don't think they voted in Hamas for no reason, that would be Ariel Sharon and his actions when he came to power.

like unilaterally leaving Gaza, pulling the settlers out too.

like getting ready to pull out of most of the west bank, settlers too!

YES, what an awful, awful israeli PM for the palestinians, i can see why they had no choice but to vote in Hamas, to 'resist the occupation' which was coming to an end!

Are you seriously arguing that the deliberate targetting of civilians by terrorist groups in buses/cafes/social gatherings is ever justified?

These positions assume no moral equivalence. Israel is battling enemies calling for its destruction, indeed in the long term it is effectively fighting for its own survival. As in any struggle of this nature, she may sometimes go overboard in her attempts to do this (resulting in some rather tragic, unfortunate and occassionally unacceptable consequences). However, overall her aim is not to decimate the Palestinians, nor to remove them from the area, but merely to defend her own borders. The Palestinians, on the other hand, see the use of force against people who are not directly part of the conflict as a completely legitimate tactic. The aim eventually is to remove Israel from the map and as a feasible entity. The perspectives of the two sides towards this conflict are very different.

So effectively, you support the Palestinians because you feel they are in a weaker position to the Israelis?

So would you have supported the Israelis in 1948?

That's a very simplistic manner of looking at things don't you think?

I support neither, I just said it appears I support Palestine because they are the underdogs in D&D. In other words on this issue I like chosing the side with the fewest supporters and trying to debate it, it's more of a challenge  

I'm a big fan of the Socratic method.

They're not the underdogs. They're winning the poll, for starters. Strong supporters of Israel are not a common bunch.

Apologies Agent Smith.

Still, I believe the point still stands. If I felt Israel deliberately massacred Palestinian civilians, and for no good reason other than the fact that they wished to drive them out of the area, my support for Israel would be considerably less strong.

Oh and like the poll means a lot  

If this thread is any indication they aren't that rare, we have some quite vocal supporters here, even if they are the usual suspects  

I could change sides but where would be the point, I don't think either side is convincingly up in the debate.

I can put up hate filled racist Zionist propaganda as well if you'd like and claim that it represented anything but drivel  

 

Except the equivalent of what would be MINORITY "drivel" on that side (the equivalent being what Hamas claim) is not a minority view, but one that wins elections on the palestinian side.

So you think the Palestines did not have any reason to be offended that a man as they see it who had been responsible for one of the greatest living attrocities not that long ago had come to power, not only had he been completely absolved for Sabrilla and he had been promoted to the position of Prime minister, be afraid be very afraid, and his hard line rhetoric did not exactly bode well for Palestine. He did invade the West Bank and refuse to pull out even after the US refused to veto a UN resolution that asked them to do so. Come on Jon peoples memories are longer than five years, particularly with such a despised figure as Ariel Sharon. 5 years seems perfectly reasonable, tell me how long did the Palestinian govt still have to serve out before they could vote again?

All I'm saying is voting in hard line govts does not happen in a vacuum. It's hardly an Earth shattering point is it?

What's "being the usual suspects" got to do with it? What does it even mean? It's not as if it's surprising that users who have a track record of supporting Israel continue to do so.

And yes, there are vocal posters around; but although they're forceful, they're not actually very numerous.

The poll is fairly meaningless to be honest, they usually are.

I'd feel better if there were more usual suspects on the other side, but there aren't, it's not meant to be derogatory, but most threads on this subject have 5 of the usual subjects and few of any other debaters.

Maybe they've been scared off by the fervent, especially because the mods appear to be either disinterested or highly supportive of Israel. It's constructive criticism not a whinge, but I detect a bias, and it isn't clear from the TSR poll why?

Maybe supporters of Palestine feel secure in there position or don't care, or, maybe Zionists are just more adamant, who knows? But I think you can't fail to notice - or I can't - that in recent history the Israeli champions are the majority posters on this issue. This thread shows this adequately.

Of course you may argue they are just wrong but I think we both know it isn't a black and white issue, although some posters appear to think it is.

It's not any of those things. It's what Jon pointed out before. Most of those people who have voted for the Palestinians do so out of solidarity for their fellow Muslims rather than on any rational basis. They simply don't understand the conflict and when they actually bring their opinions to the fore they simply get ripped apart, so they vote and then keep schtum.

It's as simple as that.

No offence but there is a good case to be argued, I don't think it's just that, that is ignorant.

They keep schtum because of the culture of this site, the amount of hardline opinions on the other side.

As a bystander and a fence sitter I am amazed that people don't hop in and thanks to those that do but rarely - I do and I get warned for racism by overzealous mods with a bias, even though I am impartial - I think the mod bias is clear, and I think many people who care about such things are turned off posting.

And by the way Jon who I thought of as knowledgeable has got lazy, he better up his act and not get banned for being an obnoxious debater.

Seriously- if I was truly passionate about a debate and felt I had something to offer, then I wouldn't be put off by a few choice words here and there. I'd be busy trying to prove the person opposing my view was actually one of those few choice words instead.

I also don't agree with your observation about "racism". I see Agent Smith make negative comments towards Israeli policy the whole time, but I know that he's not anti-semitic, and I know he's not anti-Israel, because of the actual observations he makes and the way in which they are expressed. There is a clear difference between legitimate criticism of Israel (which I am sometimes happy to partake in myself), and criticism of Israel simply because it is a Jewish state. This is one that you no doubt breached.

They keep schtum because they've been fed this "Israel is the big bad monster and the root of all evil" propaganda. When they find out that there is actually another side, and that they know very little about the conflict apart from the fact that their Muslim brothers are seemingly oppressed, they then crumble and don't come back.

Ban?! What do you mean "ban"? How do you ban a belief in something? There was never any "ban" - all there was was a pathetic UN GA resolution (non-binding) that criticised Zionism. And it was repealed by a MASSIVE majority over 15 years ago and is regarded by almost everyone as being a stain on the UN's record. Except you, who is apparently obsessed with it despite patently not understanding what went on at all. You're a joke - you keep attempting to play up something that is seen by most as a shameful episode in the past as if it is still relevant and valid today - it's pathetic.

Once again displaying your tremendous ignorance. I could go on about who was actually responsible and point out that your describing it as "one of the greatest living atrocities" is such a ridiculous exaggeration as to be almost comical, but I think you're beyond the help of truth, fact and reasoned analysis.

Please don't make judgements, we went through 4 pages of Bismarck trying to prove I was racist by claiming Zionist propoganda was racist before. If you care to do a search on me when the search function actually works, if you can find one post that is racist I'll give you a medal. It was Bismark who did it and it was simply a childish you called this language racist you must be a racist, despite the UN doing the same. It's racist it's nationalistic and whats worse it has no place in legality, damn right I'll call it racist and I don't expect to get warned for it.

They're right Israel is guilty of some atrocities, the same as Palestine, you mean they didn't know it was just one sided before, now the media is willing to report Israels misdemeanours and under Sharon there were alot, we see the truth and so people have turned against Israel, we could debate whether that was unfair, in fact is it unfair. I started a thread about the legacy of Sharon, and was called all sorts of names, and fed all sorts of Zionist propaganda, the thread died because it was a flame war, and not on my side by the way.

This is I think the main reason people don't join, obnoxious idiots shouting at each other.

Hehe. Yeah, if that's the excuse you want to make to avoid responding to my once again tearing you apart and revealing you to be completely ignorant of the subject, fine. You might want to make the proposed time more than 48 hours, I don't know if my post will be properly buried and forgotten to the point where you won't have to respond, by then.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_...esolution_3379 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Gene...esolution_4686 

Neocons.

Bush decided it was now fine that you could use zionist propaganda as their was nothing wrong with it, as simple as that. Not everyone agreed. Including it seems me.  

In essence it's still racist, but they have stopped being as racist in their rhetoric. However I did see the same rhetoric of 1975 being used here and I was warned for calling it racist.

I think we've closed the case on that decision though, it was preposterous  

Bush seems to forget in his speech that Israel's claim to existence wasn't what the UN was bothered about ;no; it was the fact that Israel claimed Palestine did not have that right, and was using all sorts of quasi legal and imperialistic mumbo jumbo to justify it's military and political actions.

 
Recalling its resolution 1904 (XVIII) of 20 November 1963, proclaiming the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and in particular its affirmation that "any doctrine of racial differentiation or superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous" and its expression of alarm at "the manifestations of racial discrimination still in evidence in some areas in the world, some of which are imposed by certain Governments by means of legislative, administrative or other measures",

Recalling also that, in its resolution 3151 G (XXVIII) of 14 December 1973, the General Assembly condemned, inter alia, the unholy alliance between South African racism and zionism,

Taking note of the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace 1975, proclaimed by the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July 1975, which promulgated the principle that "international co-operation and peace require the achievement of national liberation and independence, the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism, foreign occupation, zionism, apartheid and racial discrimination in all its forms, as well as the recognition of the dignity of peoples and their right to self-determination",

Taking note also of resolution 77 (XII) adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its twelfth ordinary session, held at Kampala from 28 July to 1 August 1975, which considered "that the racist regime in occupied Palestine and the racist regime in Zimbabwe and South Africa have a common imperialist origin, forming a whole and having the same racist structure and being organically linked in their policy aimed at repression of the dignity and integrity of the human being",

Taking note also of the Political Declaration and Strategy to Strengthen International Peace and Security and to Intensify Solidarity and Mutual Assistance among Non-Aligned Countries, adopted at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima from 25 to 30 August 1975, which most severely condemned zionism as a threat to world peace and security and called upon all countries to oppose this racist and imperalist ideology,

Determines that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination.

So, correct me if I'm wrong but what you're actually saying is: "Please don't make judgements about what is and is not racist. Incidentally, Zionism is racist mmkay"

 
They're right Israel is guilty of some atrocities, the same as Palestine, you mean they didn't know it was just one sided before, now the media is willing to report Israels misdemeanours and under Sharon there were alot, we see the truth and so people have turned against Israel, we could debate whether that was unfair, in fact is it unfair.

The way you're wording that, anyone would think there'd been a massive coverup of systematic atrocities by the Israelis that has only just come to light, thus swinging public opinion against Israel. I don't think that's the reason at all. For one thing, the systematic atrocities do not exist. They are scattered mistakes and abuses by individual units, squads or soldiers, and those responsible are invariably dealt with firmly when top brass find out.

As to why public opinion is against Israel, well, one fairly simple starting point would be the proportion of Jews to Muslims in the UK. If you assume that non-Jews and non-Muslims will be split roughly 50-50, or too apathetic to vote, then that factor alone would give you pro-Palestinian poll results because of the "our Muslim brothers" factor that leads 99.9% of Muslims the world over to oppose the Israelis, and a similar phenomenon among the Jews, who are far less numerous.

If you don't buy that then there's also the current popularity of the left and centre-left among students to be borne in mind; this side of the political spectrum is currently chums with the Palestinians (for little other reason than because they're underdogs of a sort), so when young people start to flirt with Socialism it's common for anti-Israel-ism to come in the same package. TSR is a student forum, so even taking account of the centre-right filter of D&D this traditional student lefty bias is going to shine through.

Maybe the realisation that the UN believing in self-determination but declaring Jewish self-determination as a racist endeavour was pretty hard to justify in any way and in fact stank of anti-semitism?

Actually, it had quite a lot to do with the end of the USSR - look at how many of the original backers were Soviet-involved Communist dictatorships. The lessening of tensions between Israel and the Islamic/Arab world played a role too - in 1975 the Yom Kippur war was recent, by 1991 Israel had struck a peace deal with Egypt and relations were improving.
 
 
No just massive ignorance until now. With the advent of the internet and less right wing broadsheets, now we get the full picture and can decide for ourselves. It is precisely because of this information that I have gone from supporting Israel to supporting neither.

Could you give figures on the number of Jews and muslims in the UK, not that I buy this for a minute but I want to see the ratio.

Yeah, not everyone agreed, you're in the good company of the only countries who voted against 46/86: Islamic countries (and not even all of them), Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam.
That's a group to be proud to be part of right? Because you know, most people would be embarassed to know that they were keeping company with no-one but Islamic States and repressive Communisty dictatorships.

In fact, the only European countries that ever backed the original 3379 were: Czechoslovakia (Communist dictatorship), Albania (Communist dictatorship), Portugal (left-wing coup in 1974), East Germany (speaks for itself) and Hungary (Communist dictatorship).

To be honest, your views on the issue really are apparently only at home in Communist dictatorships and Islamic States.

In fact, I know you're a fan of wiki:
"Resolution 3379 was revoked by UN General Assembly Resolution 4686. Although Resolution 3379 has been revoked, the fact that it was passed and stayed in force for 16 years is often cited as an evidence of United Nations prejudice against the Jewish state, [1] [2] and has provided an impetus for calls for reforms within the UN [3]."

See - as I said - it's regarded as a shameful period in UN history, not something to be proud of as you see it.

Could you give figures on the number of Jews and muslims in the UK, not that I buy this for a minute but I want to see the ratio.

 

2001 Census:

Muslims: 1,546,626
Jews: 259, 927

It's around 5/6:1

And my guess is that the gap has only widened since then, given that Muslim birth-rates are generally quite high as compared to the country as a whole.
 
 
It's kind of like when those silly people ask me what football team i support: none; i don't play football; i don't feel any strongly emotive or personal identification with a football club. I don't participate in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; nor do i see either nation as an end in itself.

Any "support" i give to either Israel or Palestine is contingent on the institutions of the entity therein contributing to the greater extent towards the happiness and success of the regional populations. I would therefore favour Israel, but "support" only those policies which appear benevolent and beneficial. I accept those measures which seem necessary, however malignant their side effects.

Any support for Israel ends where i think that the state is doing more harm in good - an extremity i don't imagine we will reach any time soon.

Then comes the question: how can so many people "support" "Palestine"? What particular institutions are you in favour of?

This poll question was vague and rather meaningless anyway. There wasn't even a 'both' option until it was added quite a while after the poll was posted. I think most people would support both sides' right to live in prosperity and safety, however some might feel one side is more responsible for the present problems than the other - resulting in how they vote.

An interesting question - obviously I can't answer for them - but I have noticed that whilst many people say they "support Palestine" - when questioned further they have very little idea what they actually support. Do they want a two-State solution? Do they want a one-State solution? Do they want a secular palestinian State? Do they want an Islamic palestinian State? Do they want a democracy? - It's amazing how few of those who "support Palestine" can tell you even the basics of what sort of "Palestine" they support.

That question has become even more poignant recently with the Hamas takeover of Gaza and the split between Gaza and the West Bank - which side do those who "support Palestine" actually support? Islamist Hamas in Gaza? Secular Fatah in the West Bank? Do they want to see separate States? etc. Indeed, a poll on that may indeed be more interesting than the one in this topic which I-Soc has just made a joke.
 
 
I agree, that it's difficult to chose a side, but then we here an awful lot about it in the media, so it's hard to ignore, lots of right and left wing propaganda, depending on what media source you watch or read.

I'm an independent liberal(I vote for no one) So I read the Times(rarely) and occasionally the independent. And I watch mostly BBC24/CH4 and CNN and very rarely SKY. But to be frank I've not been following as vigilantly recently as I've been working a bit on course work.

My motivation for the poll was simple, to see the spread of people here who supported Palestine or Israel. And more importantly to see if there was anyone at all here who agreed with my position.

As I say I've never taken an internet poll imensely seriously so I'm not going to disect it. That would be a bit like the poll in: Oh I forget her name the English Oprah, thingamybobs, polls. This TSR one is no doubt full only of politicised students and not representing the population as a whole, so although you might want to bear it in mind it's hardly representative of this country.

From what i can gather, your view seems to be that you don't support either side but you see zionism as a form of racism and believe that supporting the underdog is always right....?

No supporting the under dog is fun   I believe neither side has a strong case for the moral high ground any more. I made it clear that only the Zionist propoganda outlawed by the UN is racist and they were specific, imperialistic nationalistic ideologies and it's resultant rhetoric of a no fault Israel. "We can take their land, they're not a state", "they were just nomads when we came, we had more rights? Why don't they just leave?" etc etc etc, we've heard the bilge. This is what I called racist propaganda, this is what I was warned for, this is what I don't tolerate, because it's over 40 years old and it's nonsense, a very specific set of Israeli propaganda reinvigorated on TSR for what I can only see as a laugh  . I don't really want to hear old fashioned bilge reconstituted for the new millenia, they're both BS, Israel has no right nor has ever had a right to take Palestinian land, either legal or moral, that I most particularly find racist.

I once asked an Israeli on line whether he thought Palestine should be a state, his reply was yes, but only if they agree to Israels rights, this I have no problem with, it's the flat out refusal to concede Palestine should have any rights at all that irritates; begs the question: why what makes you better than Palestine?

He was a soldier due to be sent to Lebanon during the last conflict btw, everyone has to fight in the forces in Israel for a set amount of time though so   hardly a rarity.

Outlawed ?

And nobody here that I have seen - not JonH or Agent Smith - has ever made that argument that "if they aren't a state they have no rights". Palestine is not indeed a state in fact or in history, and while this is irrelevant to whether it should be a state or not, it is something of great moral and legal importance when looking at the very heart of the question: who owes who what?

 
By the way both those quotes were what annoyed me in the first place about TSR, old fashioned bilge reconstituted for the new mmilenia, they're both BS, Israel has no right nor has ever had a right to take Palestinian land, either legal or moral.
 

Palestinian land? I assume we are counting the West Bank?

Where has anyone argued that Palestine should not have any rights at all? What a strawman fallacy.
 
 
Sidhe, I have some questions for you:

Is land taken by country X from country Y in warfare then legitimately owned by X?

If country X owns land illegitimately, is that land always owned illegitimately or at some time in the future does it become legitimate? If so, roughly how long is required.
 
 
If the UN resolves against it and declares its occupation illegal then no, technically it still belongs to country y. At least under UN law, I understand Zionists these days have little or no regard for the UN so it's a moot point, depends whether you think the UN has any right to make such judgement, or more properly the security council.

If I was you I'd read UN resolutions. Ok laws a strong term but it has the right to place sanctions on countries that do not obey resolutions, well except Israel because the US always or nearly always vetos them   so in essence it's kind of free to do what ever it likes, which of course recently almost always exacerbates the ME crisis. Which is one very major reason why I blame the US for it's part in this crisis going on so long. When only one side can be subject to UN resolutions, then really is there going to be any fair resolution of the crisis?

Land obtained illegitimately under UN constitution I'm pretty sure never becomes rightly owned, but I'd have to look it up, I'm not sure. I know the UN has never accepted Israel's right to it's post 1948 acquisitions of land.

What makes you think I was referring specifically to them, there are more than two Zionists on this site. As a matter of fact I believe when I said surely you have no rights to the post 1948 land under UN partition plan, he argued since Palestine never agreed to it, it was void and Palestine had no rights to claim those lands. He's said a lot worse, but no specifically unless the search function was working I could find the quotes that annoyed me and who said them.

 

Palestine is not a state and it never has been - we've been through this before. This doesn't mean its people have no rights, but claiming that an ancient state of Palestine was "invaded", "occupied" or strangled at birth, casts a misleading moral light on the modern context of the fight.

 
I suppose you think we are not?
 

So you are saying there was absolutely no legal or moral justification for Israel seizing control of the West Bank in 1967?

OK, you're clearly delusional. The UN never outlawed "Zionist propaganda" - god knows how such a "ban" would even function. All that happened was that the UN GA (well, essentially the Soviet, Arab and 3rd world countries - European democracies, the US etc. did not support the resolution) passed a resolution - later revoked - that said Zionism was racist. That was it. There was no ban of anything and GA resolutions aren't even binding.

I have said this numerous times now, the fact you're continuing to talk crap despite having been informed of the truth means you are a liar.

The UN gave the land to the Jews to form a State - are you calling the UN racists who said all those things?

The argument that has been made on TSR is that the land was not sovereign territory and there were not even "palestinians" in the 1940s and thus it was legitimate for the UN to give land to the Jews to form a State. However, once this simple argument has gone through your ignorance and out the other side, it's come out as this "specific set of Israeli propaganda".

The capture of the West Bank and Gaza from Jordan and Egypt was not and never has been "illegal". There are such arguments over the occupation of those areas, but the initial capture was not branded illegal, taking place as it did in the context of a defensive war. How many times do I have to demonstrate your shocking ignorance of the subject?

That's not what I'm saying, I'm saying you can't deny rights based on a technicality and you just agreed to that, state or not people have rights of abiding in their ancestral lands, just like the Massai do, just like Australian Aboriginees do, Just like the Indians of NA do, we are not living in colonialist times and imperialist rhetoric is redundant, that is my point, it seems it's incredibly difficult to understand because this is about the fourth time I've made it. You seem to have acknowledged it, unfortunately the more ardent Zionists don't that makes them racist. They assume they have an imperialistic right to land. It's quite simple.

 
So you are saying there was absolutely no legal or moral justification for Israel seizing control of the West Bank in 1967?
 

No that's what you just said, I know it's action was pre-emptive, what I don't agree with is what happened after it occupied the land and it's lack of a will to leave again, don't try and put words in my mouth.

So in your view then the West Bank still belongs to Jordan and Gaza to Egypt? Because in this scenario, those are the countries that are "y".

If you knew anything about the UN you'd know that the side subjected to UN resolutions (to a ridiculous degree that undermines the whole UN) is Israel. So you're saying that there can't be a fair resolution because of the UN only passing resolutions against Israel? I quite agree.

Secular Fatah, providing that they will look after the interests and well being of their people. Gaza and the West Bank will come under the state that will be Palestine.

Who said they have no rights because of that technicality? I never argued this, and, again, I have never really seen it argued by our more learned fellows here. A moral right of a abode in a particular place, is something I argued for in the "Should Israel exist?" thread - I rejected vehemently, the notion that might is right on matters of ownership. What I refuse to entertain is that people who support Palestine should be able to retrospectively claim special political, historical and legal considerations out of the blue, when these various national - not human rights - claims were simply not even a part of the landscape when the picture was painted. When we are looking at the middle east in 1896-1948, we cannot simply invent countries - it distorts the history dishonestly. Now how a people live on the land they are born on, in is pretty much irrelevant to whether it has certain political orlegal status or not. But, what they can do in a world of other nations, very much depends on this. Furthermore, what they can claim from other nations, also depends on this.

 
No that's what you just said, I know it's action was pre-emptive, what I don't agree with is what happened after it occupied the land and it's lack of a will to leave again, don't try and put words in my mouth.
 

I didn't "put words in your mouth". Note the question mark at the end of my remark - I was asking for clarification on your position. As for leaving the West Bank, well, you know the deal: land for peace.

Mizzy that's kind of my point: the Palestinian people have all the same human rights as everybody else, but people cannot simply start claiming state rights for entities that do not exists as states. Indeed, the principle of self-determination is one of the most strictly interpreted in international law.

"You support Israel! You must be a Jew!"

Good grief, man. You'd be quick to protest if I were to say "Ah, you support the Palestinians. You must therefore be an anti-Semitic Muslim", wouldn't you?

NEWSFLASH: It doesn't matter if he's a Jew or not.
 
 
I'd say palestine because:
The Jews were first being killed in war world II and they kept moving from a country to another complaining and moaning and then the British people got tired of them and wanted to get rid of them and their issues so the queen signed a contract saying that Palestine belongs to the Jews ( as if she owns palestine =__=).

So the British took the Jews to palestine and then they called it Israel. Now the Jews say that Palestine belonged to them from 6000 years (as they say it says in their holy scriptures >_>) which is a lie. Palestine belonged to the arabs not the Jews.. they were the original people that lived there.. its their country.
I dont want to be biased really because i am not racist and i got nothing against Jews.

If the jews want to live in Palestine, then why dont they live in peace? Why are they being so foolish and want to get rid of all the palestinians?
Cant they see how many years they have fought against the palestinians and how many times they failed to get rid of them?

Ok.. now about this terrorist problem. Some people got this stupid idea that the arabs are terrorists =__=
Take it logically:
1) The british sign a contract giving a country that is not theirs to the Jews.
2)The Jews rename the country as Israel and try to kick the arabs out of their OWN country
3) America helps the Jews to take over palestine by sending soldiers and dropping bombs in Palestine
Now really think about it... who are really the terrorists? Its the americans and the Isrealis. The arabs are trying to take revenge and thats all..

Damnit just watch the news.. 1000s of arabs get killed and they bring a short story about it but if there was and american slodier or and an Israeli soldier killed they'll make a HUGE story out of it! =__= And OMG.. i cant believe what i saw in the news. Israelis are searching Palestine inside out just because they want to find their DEAD soldier's body! Everyday palestinian children get burried under the rubble of their destroyed houses and Israelis dont give a damn.
Look at America talking about human rights.. of course that only applies to their country and nowhere else =__=

I will ALSO blame the other arab countries for not helping the palestinians out and asking for peace between the israelis and palestinians but nooooo they just follow what america says to them because they are too scared to be kicked off their thrown =__=. I mean the british people are awesome.. they even called Tony Blair "America's poodle" (in a news paper i read once). If you say that in the arab countries to one of their kings you'll probably disappear and no-one will find you.. >_> people over there in the arab countries dont have the right to say what ever they want about their ruler which is really lame.

As i have told you before I am not racist or biased and thats the way i look at the Palestine/Israel issue. I know i went too far with that so i will say sorry.. SORRY PEOPLE! >__<!
 
 
A few points, can you break up your paragraphs Near that was hard to read.

The UN gave the land to Israel. The English tried to broker a peaceful settlement but it wasn't agreed to so they handed over control to the newly formed UN.

Zionists originally existed in many countries and felt that they needed to re-establish a homeland, the Zionist movement had existed since 1895, but post war when Jewish sympathies were at their highest and refugee influx into what was Trans-Jordan was at it's largest was when they tried to gain a country; sensing it was the perfect time to lobby the powers for a state, they lobbied the American president and the UN and various members of the UN council,but most importantly the US president who of course had been influential in starting the UN, to try and pressure them into giving them a two state deal which they favoured over a single state. The president eventually caved in and decided on the two state solution rather than a single state, the UN decided by a majority to a partition plan, a two state deal, which Palestine refused. The next day Egypt declared war on Israel and it has been at war on and off ever since.

I think your trying to say some of the problem lies with the US, and I would agree. but I'm not sure what I'm agreeing to  

You're in the right ball park but your history is slightly off.

Of course it isn't. But I think there are definite distinctions between the shades of grey.

None of those things are relevant to the warped view of history you presented. The things you said happened never did. Thus it's not just your opinion that's wrong; your facts are. It's usually best to confirm the facts before telling them to other people.

Most of the Western countries support Israel, not just America.

I was merely pointing out the incorrect fact in your long post. If I read it correctly, you were suggesting that the Americans fought in the 1948 Israeli war of independence?   Here it is again, below:

and yes there are some facts that are true but i do admit that some things i said might not be so true o.o
I am STILL learning you know

Just did are you lazy? Bottom of the second page of that pdf bottom left, just before the bolded letters [XXX], just before it breaks a paragraph, I can't cut and paste it the pdf is uncuttable. Sorry, if you don't want to accept reality or go where I directed that's your look out but I think people who do are assured by that quote, from official minutes that it is true. It is the official UN site. It's only two pages long, it's not Tolstoy.

Here even more info.

Are you being deliberately obtuse, because enquiring minds want to know?

Sidhe, shouldn't you just accept you were wrong on this point?

All the resolution does is express a view on Zionism, it does not ban 'Zionist propaganda' (which is a term open to interpretation anyway). Such a ban would not be enforceable by the UN in any event.

Isn't that worse it bans Zionism in any form? Zionism being banned means that Zionist propaganda is not, is that the case you're trying to make?

All it is is a non-binding resolution which expresses a view on Zionism, it bans nothing, it forces no country to do anything, it had no effect on anything at all.
 
 
From the U.N. resolution:

 
In particular its affirmation that "any doctrine of racial differentiation or superiority is scientifically false
 

Wow, it's a good thing the UN decided this so far in advance. I didn't realise they had absolute power to affirm something and make it scientifically true!

Scientifically there is no difference between an African man and a European one on a genetic level, at least no differences that would proclaim one race has higher status than another. Perhaps skin colour counts? They are absolutely spot on.

Do you know what I find absurd, the fact that I'm arguing for non discrimination and being labelled a racist by Bismarck, are you really trying to state that I am a racist?

I didn't say it was binding I said the UN proclaimed it racist, they were awarded extra funding to ensure this became the way they would progress and that the nations of the world would agree to proceed, you seem to be oblivious to the fact that the UN is the nations of the Earth and they passed the bill with a majority, if any country decided not to follow, then like in apartheid they could be sanctioned; Israel decided not to trouble the UN with the Zionist propaganda it had begun to put forth. Wise move. They still don't because it doesn't play too well to the general assembly or the security council.

Don't try to change the topic. This entire point is irrelevant. And no, it doesn't ban Zionism: it encourages member states to take action against it. Are you going to admit you were wrong or are you continue to dig an even deeper hole?

What the heck does racial discrimination have to do with banning Zionist propaganda? The words ban and propaganda aren't even used. What's wrong with you?  
 
 
Near, you're quite frankly speaking codswallop: stop it. What you are saying, and the way you are saying it, is typical of the pro-Palis here. What I don't believe is that you will vote in the poll, every point you make will be rebutted, and a few weeks later, you will enter the same discussion with exactly the same unreformed, quite frankly false "opinions". While we are on the subject of opinions, some things are either true or not true, or indeed false. Opinions has bugger all to do with it. So if you have an "opinion" that doesn't reflect fact, amend it or drop it altogether.

Sidhe, you're inconsistent and quite frankly irritating. Where you get this notion that certain arguments were "banned" I have no idea (Banned?! How?! By who?! The same UN you denounce?! When did they have or claim the power to "ban" anything?). Zionism was condemned by a non-binding resolution, nothing more. Time and again you use the same old arguments, time and again, they are sent down the same way they came.

I am quite frankly shocked by the cavalier attitude to truth that so many of the pro-Palis have on here. Most of the people who voted for that side know **** all about this thing, and when they are challenged, retreat into silence, and emerge a few weaks later to use the same arguments and "opinions" that have been rebutted earlier. And, as somebody said, the correlation between religion and supporting Palestine, is quite frankly disappointing.
 
 
My ass they resolved to stop Apartheid by sanction. If Israel had not withdrawn it's propaganda, I suspect they would have received equally short shrift.

You people are just unbe frikin lievable, I have proved racism in the UN was declared excisable, the nations of the world resolved that any form of discrimination should be excised by a majority, they resolved against Zionism for 25 years as being a from of racism ergo it was excisable, now can you kindly move on and stop talking drivel.

I am quite frankly shocked by the cavalier attitude to truth that so many of the pro-Israelis have on here. Most of the people who voted for that side know **** all about this thing, and when they are challenged, retreat into silence, and emerge a few weaks later to use the same arguments and "opinions" that have been rebutted earlier.

I think the same thing both sides are full of it, luckilly I'm on no ones.   because both sides are a bit odd and so biased that they can't see the wood for the saw mill.

Zionism is banned all of it as racist, it quite clearly says racism in any form is not allowed, I proved that, now either put up the whole text and show where it doesn't or kindly stop claiming victory where there is none.

It outlines what it considers racist then goes on to affirm that any form should be acted against. You'd know that if you actually read it, but I copied the conclusions and the things that are considered forms of racism so I feel no need to do so again because you refuse to read it or acknowledge them.

On ignore by you - ah sweet blessing - no more tired nonsense and arrogant drivel.

If anyone wants to read the minutes or has any doubt that I am not being honest do so.

Opinion = I think that Mozart is a better musician than Beethoven
Fact = The Prime Minister of the UK is Gordon Brown

Opinion = I think military action in Iraq was misguided
Fact = Iran is in the Middle East

Facts are to do with stating correctly how things stand. Opinion has to do with interpreting the world, not describing it. To suggest that there are US troops in Palestine is a "fact" is something you really ought to prove, not just defend by saying it's an opinion, because it's eiter true or not true. Not all opinions are correct.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Conference_of_1991 

If you want to look up the resolutions made, you'll find zionist points were conspicuously absent despite them winning the freedom to expound it. They then achieved some real peace concessions, thankfully Israel has more sense than you, because it had no effect on you and the truth never will.

OK let's make this nice and easy it resolves to eliminate racism in any form, including Zionism, this equals it does not ban racism from the UN, why?

I quote resolution to eliminate all forms and by extension Zionism.

 
3379(XXX)Elimination of all forms of racial descrimination
 

Case proven the UN banned zionism and by extension any form of its dissemination from the UN and hoped the general council ie everyone may move forward and ban it in any country. Resolution passed by a majority of UN members.

i guess you are right but people are just putting me down and saying that im wrong but they dont give me any corrections what so ever.
if they give me some knowledge i might rethink what i said and admit that they are right. Im not afraid to admit my wrongs.
Though i base my view on what i see, hear and read on tv or and on what others have said to me.
I am really sorry if i have said false facts.

It does though already and God be praised, I'm on board with that, but people argue that Palestine does not exist and does not belong to the Palestinians and that Israel is entitled to own and invade their land at whim, that's my issue apparently that's racist  

An eye for an eye and a right for a right.

the Quran isn't racist and does not command that the isrealites should have the land, but it does however mention that they will regain the land one day.

17:4] We addressed the Children of Israel in the scripture: "You will commit gross evil on earth, twice. You are destined to fall into great heights of arrogance.

[17:5] "When the first time comes to pass, we will send against you servants of ours who possess great might, and they will invade your homes. This is a prophecy that must come to pass.

[17:6] "Afterwards, we will give you a turn over them, and will supply you with a lot of wealth and children; we will give you the upper hand.

[17:7] "If you work righteousness, you work righteousness for your own good, but if you commit evil you do so to your own detriment. Thus, when the second time comes to pass, they will defeat you and enter the masjid, just as they did the first time. They will wipe out all the gains you had accomplished."

either your god contradicts himself or i am right, either way, i have debunked islam...

7   “And We made a people, considered weak (and of no account), inheritors of lands in both East and West, - lands whereon We sent down our blessings. The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because they had patience and constancy, and We leveled to the ground the great Works and fine Buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected (with such pride).”

7   “We took the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea. They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had. They said: “O Moses! Fashion for us a god like unto gods they have. He said: “Surely ye are a people without knowledge,”

you're wrong mate, those veses show how the isrealites over came pharoah and that God supports the rightoeus. God is not a racist and the isrealites are not the chosen people.
i really don't understand what you're trying to prove with those verses anyway. it mentions a part of history that took place a long ago and has nothing to do with the israelites returning to the lands now.

You'd think they'd have learnt their lesson about lying. Apparently not.
 
 
True Hodan, but also some of the orthodox Jewish Rabbis don't believe they came back at quite the right time because they had not fulfilled x and did not deserve Israel quite then   But this is scripture not history, and it belongs really in Religion D&D. And if we want to argue that over politics then so be it but... Can we move scriptural interpretation to the religious part of the forum, probably not but it's a friendly request.  

I would not deny a state the right to exist or not exist on the basis of scripture, either way, I'm sure no one would in political circles.

Weird in that we can't see how the "UN banned Zionist propaganda" when there is no mention anywhere of the word "propaganda" or any of its synonyms or derivatives or "ban" or any of its synonyms or derivatives?

Anyway, the point being consistently ignored here is that 3379 was passed due to a combination of the influence of the Islamic States and the Soviet bloc - without any support from European democracies at all - and the fact that it was later REVOKED by a much bigger majority than passed it - with the only States not wanting to revoke it being some Islamic States, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba. Every single country at the UN from Europe and the Americas (as well as numerous others) voted to revoke 3379 (bar Cuba).

So the British took the Jews to palestine and then they called it Israel. Now the Jews say that Palestine belonged to them from 6000 years (as they say it says in their holy scriptures >_>) which is a lie. Palestine belonged to the arabs not the Jews.. they were the original people that lived there.. its their country.
I dont want to be biased really because i am not racist and i got nothing against Jews.

If the jews want to live in Palestine, then why dont they live in peace? Why are they being so foolish and want to get rid of all the palestinians?
Cant they see how many years they have fought against the palestinians and how many times they failed to get rid of them?

Ok.. now about this terrorist problem. Some people got this stupid idea that the arabs are terrorists =__=
Take it logically:
1) The british sign a contract giving a country that is not theirs to the Jews.
2)The Jews rename the country as Israel and try to kick the arabs out of their OWN country
3) America helps the Jews to take over palestine by sending soldiers and dropping bombs in Palestine
Now really think about it... who are really the terrorists? Its the americans and the Isrealis. The arabs are trying to take revenge and thats all..

Damnit just watch the news.. 1000s of arabs get killed and they bring a short story about it but if there was and american slodier or and an Israeli soldier killed they'll make a HUGE story out of it! =__= And OMG.. i cant believe what i saw in the news. Israelis are searching Palestine inside out just because they want to find their DEAD soldier's body! Everyday palestinian children get burried under the rubble of their destroyed houses and Israelis dont give a damn.
Look at America talking about human rights.. of course that only applies to their country and nowhere else =__=

I will ALSO blame the other arab countries for not helping the palestinians out and asking for peace between the israelis and palestinians but nooooo they just follow what america says to them because they are too scared to be kicked off their thrown =__=. I mean the british people are awesome.. they even called Tony Blair "America's poodle" (in a news paper i read once). If you say that in the arab countries to one of their kings you'll probably disappear and no-one will find you.. >_> people over there in the arab countries dont have the right to say what ever they want about their ruler which is really lame.

As i have told you before I am not racist or biased and thats the way i look at the Palestine/Israel issue. I know i went too far with that so i will say sorry.. SORRY PEOPLE! >__<!

 

This is largely incorrect. And having seen this sort of thing over and over again, one starts to understand why JonH and others just lose patience with you guys. If you want to learn more about it (and do you actually?), just read through the discussions, and check your facts before posting.
 
 
Reopened. Please limit discussion to things that are at least somewhat relevant to Israel and Palestine.

Withdrawn it's propaganda? What on Earth does that mean? You know what the Israeli response was to 3379? The Israeli ambassador TORE IT IN HALF in front of the UN GA. Israel didn't do anything else about the resolution. Anyway, Israel would not need to "withdraw" anything to avoid sanctions - sanctions can only be passed by the SC and the US, France and UK would have vetoed the very idea stright off the bat (as they would today).

Theres a lot of things that are reported on Israeli TV that arent over here. Palestinian army men shield themselves with women and children, is that fair?I have friends in Israel, and it is the scariest thing for them living there. Imagine being 15/16 again for a minute, and going on a school trip being guarded by armed members of the army?? Or how about finding out one of your friends has been killed by a Katyusha rocket [however you spell it] in the middle of the road?. Living in constant fear cannot be good for either side, but think how the people of Israel feel, the ONLY Jewish state in the entire world, however there are many many Christian and Islamic states. Israel is a tiny state at that. Surely it isnt much to ask for, from palestine for a tiny bit of land? But yet Israel keep having to give bits of land to surrounding countries and hundreds of their soldiers have gone missing or kidnapped.
Is it really fair or right that David Miliband in the new government praises Hamas for releasing Alan Johnston?? THEY KEPT THE MAN CAPTIVE FOR FOUR MONTHS!

I suspect, although I don't know myself, that the mentality is similar to that of the Blitz in 1940s Britain.

Well, to say nothing would be ungrateful. And wasn't he held by some other group, and Hamas merely negotiated his release? Fair's fair, that deserves thanks. Even if virtually everything else Hamas does is bad.
 
 
No good can come by citing "historical rights" and stuff like that. The fact is Israel exists and large populations of Palestinians live in that country, leading to civil unrest. I believe that this Israeli-Palestinian conflict precipitated global Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. If this issue was resolved, say a decade ago, the world would have been a different place. The best thing that can happen now is the creation of a Sovereign Palestinian state. If need be, Jerusalem should be converted into a "Neutral City", much like Vatican and an international security force should protect it. Both Jews and Muslims should be allowed to perform pilgrimages to their Holy Sites. As I see it, terrorism and armed conflict can never be to the benefit of the Palestinians. They should adopt a policy of non-aggression, much like Mahatma Ghandi. A few years of peace might result in constructive dialogue. And maybe, just maybe we can put this issue to rest forever. But for that to happen a lot needs to change on both sides.

I've seen Israeli newspapers if they're any example then I don't think I'd be much less inclined to take it as somewhat biased to say the least.

Mind you US TV is even more biased look at Fox, might as well declare itself the second state of Israel. Foxrael.

Watch non biased news for the facts I'd advise.

Not that Israeli bias isn't perfectly understandable, but US bias is a joke amongst its own people, trust me  

Edit: why don't Isrealis have there own TV on English cable like Muslims do I wonder? Lack of demand,

The problem is that David Miliband is Jewish, and to get far as a jewish MP you have to be seen to criticise israel otherwise people will write you off as an ignorant jewish zionist....
 
 
His Jewishness is token.

Politics is a game, you play it by stealth and by obvious gestures, his Jewishness sends a message that Israel is willing to praise Hamas when it does good things, if you read between the lines, which political bods do.

At least they didn't cut his head off, I've seen about enough of that already

Rubbish. This "root cause" crud is so much nonsense. The Islamists are experts at grievances - anything can become a grievance for them, they've got dozens of them - are you telling me that you think bombings against dozens of countries spanning every continent are all traceable back to this one cause? What about all their other "issues" - Kashmir (attacks on India), Chechyna (attacks on Russia), US troops in Saudi (attacks on the US)? All these just magically disappear if the palestinians get a State? And what about the stated Islamist goal of restoring the Caliphate and spreading Sharia Law? Would they not be doing their "religious duty" if the Israelis and palestinians had sorted out their issues? Not buying it for a second.

So now all Jews speak for Israel? That's a massive load of crap - his comments mean nothing as far as Israel's willingness to deal with Hamas go. How the hell do you interpret words of the British foreign minister as representing the Israeli government's position simply because he's of Jewish heritage? The Israeli government knows Hamas is an Islamist, terrorist group - it is not willing to deal with it.

I wonder if that would really work. I hate terrorism, but, whatever anybody says, it works as a means of precipitating discussion. Now don't tell anyone I told you that.

Despite your obvious (and hilarious) ignorance Mohamed you reminded me of something someone told me a while ago.

Those who support israel do so because of something posisitive (liberal democracy, great medical research, amazing food bla bla) and those who support the palestinians do so because of something negative (they're being opressed/abused/occupied by israel). Never, ever have i heard of anyone support the palestinians because of something positive, nothing cultural, no research, no anything!

No im not saying the palestinians don't bring a lot to the world in a positive way but it seems that those who 'support palestine' actually just hate israel. Whereas those who support israel, actually know what they're supporting....

Palestinian olive trees sold to rich Israelis

Israel's Defence Ministry is investigating reports that Palestinian olive trees uprooted to make way for a security fence are being sold illegally to rich Israelis and town councils, sometimes for thousands of pounds each.

The illegal trade in olive trees has flourished as Israeli contractors, supported by armed guards, clear Palestinian agricultural land where an 80-mile electronic fence is being built to seal off the West Bank.

Thousands of olive trees have been dug up to make way for the 150-ft wide barrier and security zone. Its route usually passes inside Palestinian territory, not along the old pre-1967 border, and thousands of Palestinian farmers say their livelihood is being taken away.

Sale of the olive trees emerged after the owner of a contracting company offered two reporters from a popular Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, 100 large olive trees for £150 each.

The reporters found one enormous tree, said to be 600 years old, on sale at an Israeli plant nursery for £3,500. They said the trade was conducted with the complicity of an official in the civil administration, the Israeli military government in the occupied territories.

Olive trees are extremely hardy, can live for hundreds of years and will often stand transplanting. Gnarled old specimens which are claimed, with some exaggeration, to have been alive at the time of Jesus are much sought after for gardens of the rich or city parks.

The Defence Ministry, which is in charge of the security fence, said it had launched an investigation. "The ministry pays contractors for uprooting and replanting and, in their contract, there is no clause that allows for trade in the trees. If there is such a trade, it is a criminal activity," it said.

Some contracts require the olive trees to be relocated to areas suggested by their owners outside the Israeli-declared security zone. But Yael Stein, researcher for B'tselem, an Israeli human rights organisation, said: "We have never seen any relocation. The contractors cannot just sell the trees. That is theft."

While the trees may be ornaments to Israelis, olives are the lifeblood of Palestinian agriculture, almost the only crop which grows on the stony hillsides of the West Bank without irrigation. Most Palestinians are unemployed after two years of violence and their staple diet is bread and olive oil.

About 11,000 Palestinian farmers will lose all or some of their land holdings to the fence. Sharif Omar, from the village of Jayous, near the Israeli town of Kochav Yair, said: "I have lost almost everything. I have lost 2,700 fruit and olive trees. And 44 of 50 acres I own have been confiscated for the fence."

His village lost seven wells, 15,000 olive trees and 50,000 citrus and other fruit trees. "This area is the agricultural store for the West Bank. They are destroying us," he said.

Israel is offering compensation for confiscated agricultural land but Palestinians are unlikely to apply, as they still hope to get their land back.
The Palestinian Agriculture Ministry says 200,000 olive trees have been destroyed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the past two years to provide security for settlers.

The £90 million fence will prevent suicide bombers infiltrating into Israel. But some Israeli border communities say depriving Palestinians of their livelihood will make for worse, not better, neighbours.

Israel has been persecuted more than Palestine as have Jews more than Palestinians, especially historically ever since c. 30AD.

The UN pretty much persecutes Israel on a regular basis, sadly it has no effect as they don't think it's fair.

It's such a shame, isn't it? Seeing these rich Israelis stealing what takes hundreds of years to grow. Greedy, isn't it.

Don't be too quick to condemn it, now.

Clearly that is corrupt behaviour. However, corruption occurs in all democracies.

The government does not support this course of action- hence the investigation.

What is more corrupt is Arafat funneling international aid from the U.N. and E.U. into his own bank account.

It is - it's such a shame that palestinians are so terrorism obsessed that there needs to be a big fence built just to keep them from blowing up Israelis. But there you go.

Let's keep to the point, shall we. Best not to always stray away from criticism of Israelis, is it? That won't be fair  

What are your thoughts on the matter, and how come you're not quick to condemn such behaviour as quick as you are to condemn Palestinians' behaviour?

That includes exports.

Lets see state endorsed mass murder of civilians or low level corruption opposed and being dealt with by the country's government. I'm not seeing how the two are comparible.

No one made a comparison anywhere.

It seems whatever the Palestinians do, however big or small it is, is immediately condemned. This is not quite the same for the Israelis.

I'm pretty sure had the Palestinians done something similar, there would've been actually condemnation, and actually a deal made out of it.

Are you capable of reading? I did condemn it. I said it was corrupt. What more do you want?

This is not exactly a massively serious matter though, and it is certainly not central to the conflict. Greediness occurs in all parts of the world. Of course there are some Israelis that are going to indulge in corrupt or criminal behaviour in order to profit. There are Americans, Brits, Spaniards, Chinese, Japanese, Saudis etc who all do this as well.

On the other hand, this doesn't really quite compare with the indiscriminate murder of civilians, the refusal to recognise Israel in any shape or form, the virulent anti-semitism which exists within the Palestinian population, or the fact that a supposed leader launders money away from the people whose interests he is supposed to represent.

So yes, Israel does commit crimes on an individual basis, I condemn these, and usually they are duly punished. Show me where the moral equivelence is please?

Edit: 37927-you are actually making a comparison (even though you deny it) which verges on paranoia. The reason why Palestinian actions are condemned strongly is because they are so much worse. Terrorism, firing rockets on innocent civilians; these are barbaric actions which lead nowhere. This tree business which you bring up is wrong, but it's certainly not barbaric.
 
 
I actually think the condemnation of both sides is about the same, OK AFAIK Palestinians haven't blown themselves and anyone in 40ft radius up recently but there kidnapping of that guy was condemned. And of course who could forget Israels invasion of Lebanon over the drop of a hat was widely condemned, what are you going to remember someone kidnapping and eventually releasing someone and a slew of other minor but significant incidences, or a country invading another again, "illegally".

There is these days an equality of condemnation which is yet another reason I don't take sides except for the purposes of debate.

Dude, why are you trying to compare? There is no need for it. I'd expect more "condemnation" if it was the other way round, btw.

First things first.

What are Palestinians' main exports and main assets?

If you think olives is one (or the main one), would you not consider olives as an important part of making a living to those farmers/Palestinians?

Isn't Palestinians making a living a big issue for you? Don't anti-Palestinians normally say Palestinians don't help themselves?

Most people don't count agricultural exports as "bringing a lot to the world". Then again, most people actually have things that they do bring to the world, so don't have to scrape the barrel.

It's the reason they were removed in the first place. And you might want to stop stating as fact that people have "stolen" when an investigation is still in progress and charges have not even been brought yet - nevermind convictions.
 
 
Hydrology experts from both Palestine and Israel have worked together to help provide a fair sharing of water resources in certain areas of Israel/Palestine. That's a very important contribution, it also reminds people that Palestinians have Universities that don't just study theology, before anyone says that   which in turn leads us to assume they probably have contributed one or two minor inventions to the world other than the easy to carry self priming suicide bomb with optional timer in digital or ticking settings  .

Except the question was - what do palestinians positively contribute to the world, not "what do they export" - virtually everywhere exports something - olives are fairly down on the list of major contributions to the world.

See, you ask for palestinian contributions to the world and what is the response?
"Olives" and "well, they've probably done something, I just don't know what".
I think that sums it up, really.

There is personal opinion, and there is fact. I personally believe the Israelis are not condemned as much as the Palestinians are for their actions.

There are a lot of things Israelis do that largely effect Palestinians and Palestinian life.

The significance of these actions of some Israelis are over-looked.

Examples: Uprooting and stealing olive trees. Olive and olive trees are the main and most prized assets of some Palestinians. The trees take hundreds of years to grow. For some, it is the difference between total poverty, and having enough to feed the family.

Doesn't anyone see Palestinians holding onto and guarding their olive trees with their life.

Another example is settler violence. It is nothing short of amazing how some Zionists reject that there is such a thing. I remember raising this point in another thread, and Zionists just totally rejecting that it actually happens.

We know that settler violence largely occurs, and we've all seen videos and read articles on them. Settlers generally can do whatever they want, and the army will not stop them, generally. They are allowed to carry guns, terrorise the Palestinians living just across the road. They can even demolish houses and shops of Palestinians - and nothing will happen to them (yes, these things have happened). Some Palestinian houses have to be caged up to protect them from settler violence.

It is a total living nightmare for some Palestinians. I'm not interested in disputing whether this happens or not, because it is a fact - my point is that it is a big factor in some Palestinians' lives. If anyone wants any videos, you could easily do a search on Google. I will not post them here because some of them are quite disturbing.

Now, if you look at it so simply, you may think stealing trees and a little bit of settler violence is nothing. But if you look into those issues, you know that they are major factors in Palestinian "life".

This is a ridiculous way of thinking and shows such ignorance. The fact that people support Palestine because their people are being opressed surly outweighs supporting a country for GREAT FOOD. This clearly shows that Israel has no leg to stand on. Furthermore not only do Israel persecute Palestinians and Arabs in Palestine but also inside Israel. Millions of Israeli born Arabs who are not born Jewish are not given the vote solely because they are Muslim, how can one condone this sought of action. Why does everyone seem to forget the fact that Israel illigelly occupy Palestine. If this was the case with France occupying Britain we would be outraged. Moreover how can people support Israel for democracy when their actions are far from democratic. Although at no point can one condone the Palestinian terrorism and the effect on Israel and It's people, It's magnitude is negligible compared to how the Palestinians are effected. Many people on this thread seem to only convey the bias view of the news espically that of the US. Listen to non bias news channel and that doesn’t include arab news channels and you will get a true picture of the situation

BTW this view is not because I hate Isreal It's as a results of LISTENING TO THE FACTS and making up my own mind !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh I know I've seen a video including all the dead women and children when an IDF unit moved in to supposedly peacefully clear people from an area so Israelis could move in, quite horrible, I've seen a lot of horrible stuff from both sides though. Basically they exceeded their orders to forcibly remove people by removing them from the planet instead of the vicinity  

Anyone who knows anything about this situation and is not totally biased will have seen horrible pictures from both sides, I just don't think you can weigh one side more right than the other, it's too murky now and full of ardent hatred to judge either side as particularly the Good or bad guys.

more bull**** lies from the pali side i see.

israeli arabs have the vote, their own political parties and even representives in the knesset.

i'm sorry...you were talking about facts somewhere?   funny that you should mention voting rights though given that arabs aren't even all allowed to vote in arab countries.

*sigh*

What could Palestinians, in other ways, bring to the world? If they can help it.

Isn't most of Palestinian "opportunities" destroyed or largely affected by Israel?

Hell, even the Palestinian football team aren't even able to take part in football competitions because of Israel.

Oh yeah, good point. Not.

Firstly, those trees should have been relocated. The article says none were. Zero.

Secondly, you know and everyone knows that IDF investigations is largely corrupt. They claim to make hundreds of "investigations", but most of the time, Israelis are let off lightly. The whole system is a sham.

Such was the case with Tom Hurndall's murderer, who was initially cleared, but took two years of hard work from Hurndall's father to bring justice.

I wonder if said case was actually ever concluded, and anyone ever charged over it. It's been 5 years since the article, should be enough time now to conclude an investigation.

Isn't it amazing how the IDF never (or hardly ever ) let UN, or other organisations into their "investigations"? Something to hide? Surely not.

Israeli Arabs can vote and do vote. That's why there are around 10 Arab members of the Israeli Parliament and numerous Arab political parties operating freely in Israel

Thanks for proving your incredible ignorance and/or absolute disregard for the truth.

Buhbye now.

Well, here's a though - stop terrorising Israel and actually put billions of dollars of aid money to use building a society and then contribute to the world! Revolutionary, I know. Instead, they devote massive time and effort to terrorism and consequently force Israel to take action which limits anything useful they can do. Bringers of their own misery, without a doubt.

So you don't even know what happened and you're claiming that "everyone knows" that the investigation was corrupt? You're a joke and are embarassing yourself as usual. You've never had the intelligence to manage in D&D, now you're back again and it's obvious why you were mostly absent for so long.

Another good point. Thank you.

Most of the IDF brutality is not filmed, obviously. So a lot of their brutality is unknown and swept aside. In such frequent occurances, it can only be down to eyewitnesses and word of mouth.

There are a few such videos on Youtube, though

This is a subject where the history is often overlooked and many just assume the palestinans are in the wrong because they 'blow themselves up'.

These people do not consider what one must go through to put them in a frame of mind where 'blowing themselves up' i.e. an obliterating end, is more desirable than their current life. If you look back through history the Palestinans initially welcome the Jews after the United Nations gave Israel which was actually a non-entity at the time a 'home' next to Palestine.

Since then it has been the greed of zionists and American partners who have assisted the Israeli's in becoming more powerful and as they have done so they have become more ruthless towards the Palestinian peoples.

I have seen images and footage that would shock the moderate man and still in the face of that level of suffering and adversity the Palestinians fight on which is why i think they are an honourable people.

This clearly shows that Israel has no leg to stand on. Furthermore not only do Israel persecute Palestinians and Arabs in Palestine but also inside Israel. Millions of Israeli born Arabs who are not born Jewish are not given the vote solely because they are Muslim, how can one condone this sought of action.
 

I don't - because its clearly not true!

 
Why does everyone seem to forget the fact that Israel illigelly occupy Palestine. If this was the case with France occupying Britain we would be outraged.
 

Oh dear. After 1967 when israel gained land through a defensive war and never sought to annexe it. The palestinians found themselves enjoying more freedom and more rights than they ever, ever, ever had under (just as) illegal occupation under jordan and egypt. Many 1000s started to work in israel, they were finally allowed to set up universities and hold any job they wanted.

THEN certain factions started attacking israel and unfortunately, israel (even if they HAD deserved these attacks) had to protect their people, hence the restrictions on palestinian movement, the security fence etc

 
Moreover how can people support Israel for democracy when their actions are far from democratic. Although at no point can one condone the Palestinian terrorism and the effect on Israel and It's people, It's magnitude is negligible compared to how the Palestinians are effected.
 

Care to comment on how the palestinians living in refugee camps in arab countries are affected?

 
Many people on this thread seem to only convey the bias view of the news espically that of the US. Listen to non bias news channel and that doesn’t include arab news channels and you will get a true picture of the situation
 

I get my news from a variety of sources....

Because it's a convenient way to condemn and demonise Israel without actually having to show them having done anything in particular? At a guess.
 
 
What the Palestinians do or do not bring into the world is largely irrelevant to this discussion surely? For a start, in terms of infrastructure and national and cultural cohesion, at the moment the Palestinians are not really in a position to have the same kind of national output as established states do. It's an unfair and unnecessary point to make. Moreover, what they "contribute to the world" or not, has nothing to do with how they should or should not be treated.

Is blowing up women and children on buses and in restaurants honorable? Sympathy to the plight of a people who feel they have been wronged is one thing, sympathy for terrorists is another. Pick where you stand. Have you looked at the other side? Israeli history? How many times they've been attacked in a region where they have barely gone 20 years without a major war, and a few weeks without a terrorist attack?

Interesting - given that on this forum the history is ignored by the pro-palestinians with the pro-Israelis regularly having to correct incorrect facts and historical inaccuracy.

Ahaha! You accuse others of ignoring the history and then you talk such rubbish. The irony.
1. When exactly were the "palestinians" welcoming the Jews? Because in 1948 they were readily helping the Arab armies attack them. And prior to that they had been fighting them sporadically for years.
2. Sorry, what "home next to Palestine"? Do you mean the fact that the Mandate was divided and split between the Jews and Arabs? Because there was no State of Palestine when Israel was created (or at any other time).

Ow, stop, the honourability is too much. I've heard the pro-palis come up with a lot of things about the palestinians - "downtrodden", "oppressed", but "honourable" - that's certainly a new one.

I think the point they MAY have been trying to make is that if it is 'unkown' then we have no clue if it actually goes on or whether what is reported is the only corruption that happens in the IDF, hence why it is unknown!

Sorry, I should have made that more clear.

Most of it is largely unknown/or unknown to most.

If you trust Jewish human rights organisations (some people here don't) then I could link you.

One example of what is largely unknown to most people:  http://www.btselem.org/English/Settler_Violence/ 

If you'd like more, just ask.

Similarly, may I add, when you watch settler violence in videos, you'd almost ALL THE TIME see them throw a fit if they see a camera. They get very violent - obviously. Therefore, most are reluctant to film such violence, as settlers are not afraid to use or threaten with their guns.

Example: (although their not being psysically violent, but verbally): search "Racist Zionist Jews" in Youtube. You will see how they react to the camera.

Also search "Palestinians harassed by Jewish settler in".. you see my point.

You seriously believe the only way of obtaining objective and critical truth of a situation is by asking members of the most anti-Semetic region of the world how they feel about the actions of Jewish people who they feel wronged by? Really?

How can MOST OF IT be UNKNOWN? In order for something to constitute MOST OF IT - it would have to be KNOWN about - in which case it's not unknown. Christ, this isn't rocket science.

Sidhe how was it "illegal"? You pretend to know an awful lot about international law, but clearly don't know as much as you believe. You see to think that anytime the UN lends an opinion on something or other, it has the effect of legal status. Well even by the acknowledged terms of the UN's remit, much of what it says doesn't have legal status.

I think this is more than a concept- it is a realisation that has occured consistently over the past decades.

If they blew themselves up, I'd have a hell of a lot more sympathy with their plight. However, they target women and children when they blow themselves up in order to maximise civilian casualties

The vast majority of Palestinians do not target women and children. The selection which the puts infront of your eyes may do but if you looked at the bigger picture you would realise that the majority target the Israeli soldiers. Even those who do not blow themselves up throw stones in an effort to stand against their oppression and quite often the Israeli soldiers will happily shoot back at them with their weapons

Then why did the Palestinians reject the partition plan and support the Arab countries' mission to destroy Israel in 1948?

Whether Palestine rejected the plan initially or not is accademic because it eventually went through. After that point it was Israeli greed which wanted more land and extreme border changes. Is this not true?

 

The fight between Israel and Palestine is like a fight between David and Goliath. Israel have an elite army and air force which regularly bombards civilian Palestinian areas. You talk of attempts to kill women and children, have you seen the figures? or are you ignorant to that too? The Israeli airforce has killed countless civilians- many of whom women and children. In fact i think one attack from an Israeli airforce per year kills more than the whole of the Palestinian suicide bombers.

EDIT: Apologies the second point in bold above should say the selection which the MEDIA...

"illegal" I'll repeat myself again if you feel the need to question the convention of quotations.

THe UN's actions may not be legal, but when they pass a resolution most countries who are resovled against, resolve to carry out the directives or face sanctions, of course Israel is exempt from that, you appear to be intimating like most people that the UN has no right at all to make judgements on other countries but that simply isn't true.

I don't give a damn about semantics when the term I used wasn't illegal but "illegal" there is a difference you know?

What do you want from me exactly to admit that nothing the UN does has any sense of the word legal, because that is untrue.

That's a lie. Israel do carry out targeted strikes on palestinian terrorists and their hideous etc. from aircrafts - they do not just "bombard palestinian civilian areas" for fun. If they did, then a much higher proportion of the dead would be civilians.

How many DELIBERATELY? Yes, civilians die - civilians die in every war - but that doesn't mean they are targetted or purposefully killed - it generally happens because terrorists operate from civilian areas.

That isn't making it clear - that makes just as little sense as before!

In order for it to be "most" (indeed, in order for it to be counted at all) you have to KNOW about it. You can't count something if you don't even KNOW it exists. And if you know it exists, it cannot be unknown. So either the actions are KNOWN, or they cannot be counted - they CAN'T be both unknown AND counted in as "most" of the total.

What you've said makes NO logical sense whatsoever.

OK, first off, stop constantly using bold type. It serves no purpose and it's annoying.

Secondly: Do you honestly believe that? The Israelis may be much more heavily armed, but you can't simply translate that automatically into stating that they kill far more people. With power comes responsibility, as they say, and the IDF is certainly restrained about using its weaponry.

One air raid? Killing more than an entire year's worth of suicide attacks on buses and markets? Really?

Yes, the difference being that the latter allows you to call something illegal without actually having to have any basis for the accusation - thereby avoiding all the difficult questions about what actually makes it illegal.

The Israeli army does not attempt to deliberately kill civilians. It does not "regularly bombard" civilian Palestinian areas- it deliberately targets those areas which are known to be used by terrorists. Of course collateral damage occurs, and this is regrettable, but it is an unfortunate consequence of a necessary campaign against Palestinian terrorists.

Further, given the Palestinian propensity for using civilians as human shields, it is little wonder that civilians are killed.

On the other hand Israeli authorities are constantly (I've heard the statistic once a day) preventing suicide bombs which limits Israel casualties. They have also of course built the wall which has probably saved hundreds of lives. However, this does not detract from the fact that walking on to a bus and then blowing oneself up, killing innocent women and children is quite different to the collateral damage caused by the targetting of known terrorist enclaves.

The UN does and CAN enforce international law, BUT not all of its actions have a legal dimension. The UN IS NOT a lawmaking body and it never claimed to be.

Illegal vs "illegal"; talk about semantics!

You forgot the main reason why Israel kills more people - it's because the vast majority of palestinian terror attacks are stopped by the Israeli police, intelligence services and the IDF. If every planned palestinian terror attack was successful the Israeli death toll would be many times higher than the palestinian one. So while Israel kills more, the palestinians TRY and kill far more than the Israelis do.

Just for reference - you probably shouldn't use such emotionalist lines against people who have experience of the Troubles, because they may just backfire on you. I and my mother have both been involved in bomb scares, and several of my relatives live within a few hundred yards of the locations of sectarian murders and terrorist bombings. Just so you know.

Why would they need to inquire in to more? The vast majority of the deaths are either terrorists or people killed in the course of anti-terror operations - in either case no investigation is needed because it's known how the person died and why.

Well, this myth has come up several times in this thread, implicitly and explicitly. Namely, the idea that more Palestinian civillians have died (at the hands of the Israelis) than Israeli civillians have died at the hands of the Palestinians.

Dershowitz, in his book 'The case for Israel' dispels this myth by pointing out that, if you exclude Palestinians involved in terrorism, Palestinians killed when bomb factories explode etc., and Palestinians killed by other Palestinians, from the 'civillian' category (as they are often included in it), it is actually the fact that more Israeli civillians have died than Palestinian civillians, check it out.

Why is this the case? Because Israel does actually go to great lengths to avoid killing civillians as there is no incentive for any democracy to intentionally kill civillians, this contrasts with the objectives of terrorists organisations, who have the intention of killing civillians.
 
 
then you're an idiot.

ideological disagreements with our current bourgeois (as opposed to real) democracy is no reason to ignore the fact that in arab countries (as opposed to israel) women cannot vote.

or maybe we should ignore it, even praise it, and "defend" their outdated misogynistic religion?  

now im being serious.

It is very pertinent - if democracy is bourgeois, then you are clearly being hypocritically solely, it would seem, because you hate Islam. Which is fair enough - everyone is entitled to an opinion - but at least be honest about it first up.

I don't - because its clearly not true!

Oh dear. After 1967 when israel gained land through a defensive war and never sought to annexe it. The palestinians found themselves enjoying more freedom and more rights than they ever, ever, ever had under (just as) illegal occupation under jordan and egypt. Many 1000s started to work in israel, they were finally allowed to set up universities and hold any job they wanted.

THEN certain factions started attacking israel and unfortunately, israel (even if they HAD deserved these attacks) had to protect their people, hence the restrictions on palestinian movement, the security fence etc

Care to comment on how the palestinians living in refugee camps in arab countries are affected?

I get my news from a variety of sources....

You may well be listening to the facts, but you're making a lot of it up too!

 

1. What have i made up.that arabs in isreal are not allowed to vote ? btw to all these ilinformed ignorant fools this is true. this question was asked to the isreali politician who replied that because a of jews in isreal were a minority compared to the arabs givning the arab the vote would..serverly weakned the position of jews as it would produce a arab goverment who may persecute the jews. if you wont belive me on this fact look up the special edition of question time on the situation in the middle east and you can see a video of this
2.no matter what that country has produced support should be with the country which has been the victim clearly plastine. you wouldnt support a rapist in court beacuse he was a doctor and he did good things would you thats just stupid
3.'certain factors' didnt just pick up a gun one day and attack isreal they were provoked. dont make such bais and ignorant comments
4. 'Care to comment on how the palestinians living in refugee camps in arab countries are affected? ' this is ridiclous ur justifing the actions of isreal by comparing them to arab countries. so basically ur just picking the better of two evils. so what if arab countries treat palastinians refuagess badly i am not condoming nor supporting them however it does not give isreal the right to treat palastinians reguagees the way they do
5. ' more rights than they ever' what right: freedom of movement no freedom of association no habus corpus no universial sufferage no innocent till proven guilty no so what rights have they got ? the right to be opressed !!!!!!!!

i am sorry if any of you disagree with this but not one thing which i have said is a lie i can back up everything i have said unlike many here some. however so many people just overlook the fact isreal occupy palastine illigelly or does ur selective memory just wish to overlook that fact

sorry for the spelling mistakes its 1 in the morining and i can barely keep my eyes open lol

What you're referring to is the refusal of Israel to allow the "right of return" to all the Palestinian refugees to the places they were displaced from, I believe. To allow it would be the end of Israel.

Israeli Arabs can vote, and have their own parties and seats in the Knesset. The claim that Arabs can't vote in Israel is a lie.

 
so what if arab countries treat palastinians refuagess badly i am not condoming nor supporting them however it does not give isreal the right to treat palastinians reguagees the way they do
 

Number of posts you've written complaining of Arab treatment of Palis = Zero.

If they're worse than the Israelis, why is this? Does Israel have less of a right to treat Palestinians in this way?

Buhbye now.

 

you know so little yet to claim to know everthing. not all arabs get the votes example arab refuees who were born in isreal and lived there for over 30 years dont get the vote yet a 21 year old jew does. the amount of arabs that get the vote are extremly small thus there are only 10 arab mps look at the stats more arabs live in isreal then jews yet mor jews have the vote

don't most israeli arabs boycott the elections in Israel? i went to a speech once by an israeli arab who went on how they boycott the elections in order to "make their voice heard" but apparently didn't realise that since arabs make up 20% of the israeli population a far better way of making voice heard would be to vote.

1.if you read my reply proporly u wud realise that was not what i was refering to not all arbs in isrreal get the vote full stop check the sats
2. i never cliamed that isreal have less of a right to treat palastinans in this way i said you should not justify the actions on isrel by comparing it to thier arab counterparts. at the end of the day the way isreal treats the palastinians is wrong regardless of the qay arab countries treat them

All Israeli citizens get the vote - Arab and Jew alike. If you're an Israeli citizen you can vote, if you're not, you can't.

I could go over again how Israel was legally given the land for a State, how they can't have been "occupying Palestine" because no such State existed, etc. - but they've been gone over 100 times and you aren't fooling anyone. And besides, you've proven yourself to be so completely ignorant of the subject that no-one is listening to your gibberish anyway.

you are supporting my argument. arab refuagees hardly get citzenship and only a extrme minority do therefore they cant vote as a result of not getting citzenship therfore arabs are underepresented in isreal

you fail to see boyond your narrow box of thinking

They have numerous Arab political parties and a full 10% of Knesset members - if they are boycotting they're doing a somewhat lousy job. Fact is that the majority of Israeli Arabs DO vote (though I believe their turnout is not as high as the national average in Israel).

Well, Britain hasn't given them citizenship either - Does that mean Britain is undemocratic? Israel has the right to set its own immigration quotas and is a separate state. It's moral obligation to give Arabs votes in a country which they are not citizens is non-existent. Fact is, it has huge amounts of Arab citizens who are Israeli nations who are allowed to vote.

Sorry, what are you on about? Who are these Arab refugees who want citizenship of Israel? Why would they want to be an Israeli citizen if they're a refugee? Anyway, they don't live in Israel - why should they be given citizenship of a country they don't live in?
Your incoherent, ignorant babbling would be amusing if it weren't so sad.

Not this crud again. Face historical fact - the land was legally British, the British gave it to the UN to divide, the UN split it between Jews and Arabs. Case closed, legal authority shown.

only difference britan does give citzenship to nationals who are from this country and lived in this country for many genragtions however u seem to forget that its different in palastine because how can arab refuagees be classed as that when their faimlies lived in so called isreal before the isrealis themselevs thus you cant compare the two. moreover although isreal may have arab citzens however it is outweighed by the amount of arabs refuagees who fail to get citzenship yet lived there all their lives.

You've already proven to be a liar here. I know arab-israelis and have met many, they can all vote in the elections.

 
2.no matter what that country has produced support should be with the country which has been the victim clearly plastine. you wouldnt support a rapist in court beacuse he was a doctor and he did good things would you thats just stupid
 

Your analogy is ridiculous. Arab states that didn't even border israel attacked it on the day of its inception. It became a legal state and was not taken by force. After the arabs attacked, the jews (who had no army and barely a state) attacked back. Vicious things happened on both sides, but israel didn't start it and were happy to live in peace with their neighbours....its a shame they're hte neighbours from hell.

 
3.'certain factors' didnt just pick up a gun one day and attack isreal they were provoked. dont make such bais and ignorant comments
 

They were provoked by the fact that israel existed and nothing else. The fact that they were more opressed under Jordan and Egypt and enjoyed academic and economic freedom under israel was irrelevant to them

 
4. 'Care to comment on how the palestinians living in refugee camps in arab countries are affected? ' this is ridiclous ur justifing the actions of isreal by comparing them to arab countries. so basically ur just picking the better of two evils. so what if arab countries treat palastinians refuagess badly i am not condoming nor supporting them however it does not give isreal the right to treat palastinians reguagees the way they do
 

If you can condemn israel, then before anyone takes you seriously, would you care to condemn lebanon, syria, jordan, iraq, egypt and every other arab country for a) Trying to eradicate israel when it was less than a day old and hadn't used force on anyone and b) Opressing the palestinian arab people for nearly 60 years now

 
5. ' more rights than they ever' what right: freedom of movement no freedom of association no habus corpus no universial sufferage no innocent till proven guilty no so what rights have they got ? the right to be opressed !!!!!!!!
 

How many of those rights a) Do they have in arab countries b) Did they have under Jordan and Egypt....both answers are less than what they currently have!

 
i am sorry if any of you disagree with this but not one thing which i have said is a lie i can back up everything i have said unlike many here some. however so many people just overlook the fact isreal occupy palastine illigelly or does ur selective memory just wish to overlook that fact

sorry for the spelling mistakes its 1 in the morining and i can barely keep my eyes open lol
 

Israel is NOT illegally occupying palstine (as there is no such country....at the moment). Israel is occupying jordanian and egyptian territories, both of whom decided they didn't want it. It can certainly be argued that the land ISN'T israeli and international law could be interpreted that way. What can't be interpreted and is a total lie is that the land 'belongs' to the palestinians or has previously belonged to them....
 
 
No, you don't become British because you find yourself here. You have to apply. Palestine is a separate entity from Israel; Israelis aren't Palestinians and vice versa. Palestinians never saw themselves as a nation until the late 1960's, but thought themselves as Southern Syrians, or part of the pan-Arab movement. When was the last time "Palestine" was controlled by the Palestinians? Some Arabs haven't accepted their citizenship, but they have been offered it - They rejected in on the basis as they didn't see themselves as Israeli.

There are no Arabs in Israel who are not eligible for Israeli citizenship. Again, Israel has the right to restrict immigration and non-Arab numbers. Every other country in the world has this right, why not Israel?

By the way, are you a Muslim?

Sorry...explain this to me i dont quite understand (genuinely). Are you saying that there are a significant number of illegal immigrants in israel, living in israel-proper, who don't have citizenship? Who are hiding with insrael deserts, mountaings, towns, villages etc who don't have citizenship?

Or are you referring to the palestinian arabs in the west bank and gaza, who 99% have never lived in israel (as they are too young) and most of those who have certainly wouldn't remember it as they were too young?

This poll is wrecked now, most of the votes were before the both option was available. I imagine most people would put both, but the poll actually conveys that we're all a bunch of extremists, either wanting all Israel or all Palestine lol.
 
 
has anyone else noticed that a far higher % of the votes for palestine are people who aren't well known and don't generally post in d&d whereas the voters for israel tend to be the more well known and more experienced posters in d&d:

Yeah I noticed that a few days ago. There were around 2 dozen pro-Palestine voters who either have never or barely ever post in D&D and the number has only increased since then.
 
 
Shouldn't matter. Your post seems to suggest that those who post in TSR are more knowledgeable than others.

I think it's fair to say that those who post regularly in D&D have an interest in global affairs and thus are more likely to be able to back themselves up with knowledge and arguments as oppose to those who just post in Chat and I-Soc and only show any interest in politica or global issues when there's a poll to vote in. It's not a coincidence that almost all of the non D&Ders charging in here to vote for "Palestine" are muslims.

That doesn't necessarily follow; favouring one side doesn't mean you hate the other. This isn't like a football match, where there can only be one winner.
 
 
I never said it did, I just said I'd think most people realise reality and want both to exist properly.

Sure - but what I mean is that some of those people (who I hope would be a colossal majority) would nevertheless vote for the "team" they "support", and so would be indistinguishable, at least in this poll, from the malevolent extremists. But hey - polls always work by generalising.

There are Hamas supporters and those who want to destroy Israel both posting on this forum and voting in the poll...

Sure - but what I mean is that some of those people (who I hope would be a colossal majority) would nevertheless vote for the "team" they "support", and so would be indistinguishable, at least in this poll, from the malevolent extremists. But hey - polls always work by generalising.
 

I dont know if you would vote for the team, becasue its not as trivial/similar. Teams cant coexist. I assume that when it says 'who do you support' i assume it means who you think have hte best case backing their existance, but most would argue both should exist, and thus support both's arugments of existence. Becasue the fundamental argument is that Palestine wants to exist, whether it be by wiping out Israel and taking over its land, or by simply having a separate state, and in opposition people dont want israeal to be destroyed and exist, or they want israel to expand. (i.e. the moderates/extermists on both sides)

Palestine is always gonna get more votes from goons because its the underdog. I wonder why people love the underdog - people just attach virtue to the opressed/poor regardless of whether they deserve it. This is why i dont get socialism. The working class arent necessarily more virtuous simply becasue theyre poorer, nor are the rich more expolitative/corruped simply becasue theyre rich.

Possibly; but not as many (as a fraction of the whole, that is   ) as there would be if the poll was asking everyone in the world. I think a greater proportion of people on TSR accept some variant on a two-state solution, or at least coexistence of some sort, than would be the case globally.

So why do you support palestine/the palestinians?

I support their need for a state and to live peacefully between their arab neighbours and israel. I feel that they have been pushed from pillar to post and been promised much by governments who seemed to do everything possible to not give it to them. Their leaders instil them with false hope and all it does is creat further tension, hatred and misunderstanding.

Do i support palestinian efforts to attack/seek to destroy israel? no

BTW...i think its only logical that a muslim would be more inclined to support the palestinians just as it would be for the jews to support israel....your arguments don't lose any credit because of your religion....and finally (being a bit pedantic) iran isn't an arab country....

No-one will mind, the treatment of palestinians by Arab States is very relevant to the broad topic.

That's a terrible argument. You can support according to religion where your co-religionists are involved, doesn't mean you can't care about situations where they're not.

The fact is, there's no State of "Palestine" in existence. "Palestine" does not exist. What's counter-productive to solving the problem is to try and deny reality and live in a world where you pretend things that don't exist, do exist.
 
 
See, he is right. Just because a legally recognised entity doesn't exist, doesn't mean there isn't a piece of land in the Middle East which is commonly referred to as the Palestinian Territories, or Palestine for short. There's no need to be pedantic.

If they think it should exist (that is, as a separate state) or if they think for whatever reason that what is currently known as "Israel" should in fact be termed "Palestine".

I don't think I've ever asked you - or if I have, I can't remember what you said - but do you think a State of Palestine should exist? In a two-state-solution sense, I mean.
 
 
The poll option 'Palestine' should have actually been 'The Palestinians', then there wouldn't have been this problem.

As part of a comprehensive peace agreement that sees Israel secure and palestinian terrorist groups totally dismantled, with Jerusalem in Israeli hands and no continuing threat to Israel's security or any threat to it being a Jewish State.

The nation of Palestine exists; nationality is designed by how people identify with each other. The fact that it has only existed since 1965 or so raises some very difficult questions indeed, however.

Its not fundemental to the state of Israel either, given its emphasis on being a secular state. And of course, turn that argument around and the Palestinians will argue that there can be arrangement for Jews to visit sites. The only solution is to make Jeruseulam an international city.

Only the stupid and uninformed think there is a state. The sensible people know what we are talking about. As such, it is pedantry to divert the debate onto a discussion whether using the word Palestine is appropriate.

Apart from the fact that it contains all Israel's institutions of State and is the capital city?

Yeah, like anyone in their right mind would think that would be the sensible way round to do it!

Except that a skim of this topic will show multiple people who are "stupid and uninformed" and confusing them further is clearly a bad idea. There's no barrier that only lets "sensible" people discuss the issue. Unfortunately.

I'm sure it is... but do you believe an Israeli leader would allow Jerusalem to be internationally controlled if peace rested on it?
 
 
Well at least Israel offered half of Israel as a capital of a Palestinian state in 2000...this might suggest some movement (at least at that time) towards the possibility of an international city.

It does designate it as international - but as the Arabs rejected the plan and its planned borders etc. were never adhered to or functional, it would be ridiculous to state that the details of the plan are today applicable.
 
 
A big city.

Hmm. It would very much depend on who that leader was and how strong he was - the idea has been complete anathema to Israel for decades. Put it this way - the internal struggles that Sharon had to enact the Gaza withdrawal would be nothing compared to those there would be over giving up Jerusalem.

It's the biggest city and economic centre, but Jerusalem holds all institutions of State - Knesset, Supreme Court, Ministries, etc. and is the capital.

Well, it's definitely a long term prospect - If done rightly and well, I'd fully support the idea. I could see that as the defining moment in the peace process.

Oh well, will never happen.

The UN can't decide Israel's capital city is Tel Aviv. Anyway, that resolution was only passed in response to the Jerusalem Law, by that stage Jerusalem had been Israel's de facto capital for decades.

From wikipedia:

"Most common-law countries (including Israel) apply a dualist principle in contending that international and domestic law are distinct systems of law, and that international law only applies to the extent that it does not conflict with domestic law. Most civil law countries (including most European countries) apply a monist principle and contend that there is only one system of law that incorporates both international and domestic law. This philosophical difference leads to different interpretations of the supremacy of international law over domestic law."

Israel deemed Jerusalem it's capital - as it is a countries right to do so....

The only solution to the jerusalem problem (save dropping a nuke on it to flatten everything to the ground....) is to split it up giving east jerusalem (MINUS THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM) to the arabs. Let Jerusalem be the capitla of Israel and Al Quds be the capital of palestine (East and West make it sound like Berlin/Germany)....

The reason the old city must be in the jewish state is because if we look back over hte last 60 years, when the arabs controlled the holy sites, jews weren't allowed to visit...when the jews controlled the holy sites, all religions were allowed to visit....
 
 
Quite how this important debate decended into bickering about what the capital of Israel is called is beyond me.

I can sum it up in one word: disputed. Like everything else.
 
 
With respect to those arguing otherwise, the arrangements with regards to Jerusalem are disputed. They won't be undisputed until a final peace settlement is made, because, after all, the idea that Jerusalem might be split up or made international is not impossible and could form part of such a settlement.

Have a look at an article below, which reports the BBC recently apologising for calling Jerusalem the capital of Israel:

BBC sorry for calling Jerusalem capital of Israel

The BBC apologized this week for referring to Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and promised not to repeat "the mistake," following a complaint by four British organizations.

Arab Media Watch, Muslim Public Affairs Committee, Friends of Al-Aksa and the Institute of Islamic Political Thought sent a joint complaint to the BBC after a presenter on its Football Focus program on March 24 mentioned that Jerusalem was Israel's capital and "historic soul."

The BBC's Editorial Complaints Unit posted a response on its Web site: "The reference was a passing one in a context where the focus was on sport, not politics. While recognizing the sensitivity of the issue of the status of Jerusalem, the ECU took the view that the program-makers had taken sufficient action by acknowledging the error and rectifying the Web site."

The Editorial Complaints Unit's ruling was: "Complaint resolved."

In a letter to the complaining NGOs, Fraser Steel, head of editorial complaints at the BBC, said: "We of course accept that the international community does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and that the BBC should not describe it as such. I was therefore pleased to see that Katherine Tsang [BBC Information adviser], when she wrote to you in April, acknowledged the error and apologized for it. [Presenter] Steve Boulton and other senior managers in BBC Sport told us they very much regret the mistake and apologize for it."

"Senior managers will try to ensure, as you suggest, that the mistake is not repeated. Because it appears on the Web site, there will be a public acknowledgement of the error, and the action taken in consequence."

Steel added: "I'd like to add my apologies for this most regrettable, but I'm sure accidental, factual mistake. I appreciate that the status of Jerusalem is of particular concern to Palestinians, and it is important that it is not misrepresented. I am confident that lessons have already been learned, and they will be emphasized as a result of my decision."

Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said in response: "Jerusalem is Israel's capital. It is the right of every sovereign state to determine which city will be its capital. If this is not accepted by everyone today, I am confident it will be in the future."

London-based Arab Media Watch told The Jerusalem Post: "Under international law, neither east nor west Jerusalem is considered Israel's capital. Tel Aviv is recognized as Israel's capital, pending a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians."

The Institute of Islamic Political Thought is run by Azzam Tamimi, a Hamas supporter and a member of the Muslim Association of Britain, part of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Tamimi spoke at Saturday's anti-Israel rally in London's Trafalgar Square. He blamed the British for their role in the Arab-Israeli conflict and vowed to return to his mother's house in Hebron, which he said could never become a "Zionist place."

To huge applause, Tamimi called Israel "a racist entity that sees us [Palestinians] as subhuman while they see themselves as superhuman."

Tamimi told BBC in an interview in 2004 he did not recognize Israel's right to exist and would be willing to become a suicide bomber. Last year, Merrill Lynch pulled its sponsorship from an event hosted by the London Middle East Institute because of Tamimi's participation.

The Muslim Public Affairs Committee has faced continuing allegations of extremism and anti-Semitism. In 2005, during the last general election in the UK, the group campaigned against pro-Israel and pro-Iraq war MPs, and attempted to slur one MP by claiming she was a Jew. It eventually apologized when they learned the candidate was not Jewish.

Or is this definition of "the international community" one that somehow doesn't include the most powerful and influential country on Earth?

Terrorist-supporting Islamist groups can whine all they want - Jerusalem is Israel's capital and "historic soul" (that phrase being indisputable).

Well put Jon. In my opinion, if the Palestinians/Arabs could be trusted to allow Jews access to the Western Wall and other holy sites, then this situation would not arise.

Historic soul, yes. Capital, technically, no. Officially, that's Tel Aviv, because that's where all the official stuff happens. Berlin was still the historic centre of Germany even when it wasn't the seat of government. New York is arguably a similar case for the US, although obviously in a rather more superficial sense.

However, all the BBC should be doing is making a minor and matter-of-fact apology for not being technically correct, not grovelling to the Palestinians.

Having looked at Wikipedia, I take all that back - it seems Jerusalem is the official capital. Tel Aviv must simply be the administrative centre (and as FIMN says, it's certainly the economic capital, but the could be said of São Paulo; it doesn't alter the fact that Brasilia is the capital of Brazil). Incidentally, if anyone wants to edit/deface/generally abuse it, the Wikipedia article on Israel is, incredibly enough, currently unlocked.

What, you mean "official stuff" except Parliament sessions, government business, the supreme court, etc? Official stuff happens in Jerusalem, it being the capital and all.

NY and Berlin aren't the capitals despite being main cities. Exactly how Tel Aviv is - as far as I can see those examples support my point...

Not even "the palestinians" - known terrorist-supporting and anti-semitic groups.

It actually isn't. The US recognizes Tel Aviv as Israel's capital, though it gives a wink and a nod whenever Israel claims otherwise, which is similar to the "cultural center" the US keeps in Taiwan instead of an actual embassy.

You'll find that virtually no country has its embassy in Jerusalem (there might be some, but I don't know any), which means no one explicitly supports Israel's claims. There's also the fact that no one recognized the Israeli annexation of eastern Jerusalem, and Israel claims that all of Jerusalem is its capital.

lol fair enough. i said Iran because that’s the first country that came into my head in the region with the worst treatment of its people. Although you can name many Arab countries which have no regard to their peoples human rights to which i also condemn e.g. KSA

Secondly i absolutely agree with you on 'Do i support Palestinian efforts to attack/seek to destroy Israel? no' yet many others on this thread seem to assume if you support Palestine your a fundamentalist Muslim who wishes to destroy Israel and support terrorism. You may support the cause but not the action which by the course is achieved.

The US Congress passed (by a very large majority) the "Jerusalem Embassy Act" in 1995 and it states that:
"Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel ; and the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999."

Since 1995, the relocation of the embassy has been suspended by the President semi-annually, each time stating that "[the] Administration remains committed to beginning the process of moving our embassy to Jerusalem".

As a result of the Embassy Act, official U.S. documents and web sites refer to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

How odd, seeing that the US doesn't recognize Israel's annexation of eastern Jerusalem...

Not sure. Whatever Israel took over in '67...
 
 
That seems contradictory; I suppose the only way to reconcile it is to assume that the US uses the term "Jerusalem" to mean "West" Jerusalem, and nudge-nudge-wink-wink-recognises that, not the whole, as the true capital.

Most of it, yes.
 
 
who cares, if Palestine is having none of it, it doesnt do anything to solve the problems on the ground.

because in essence, it is the walled city that is the most important part of the city - the part which has the westerm wall, haram al sharif and al aqsa mosque and plenty of churches too....

Its the part of the city that the jews of the world rejoiced when in 1967, we were finally allowed to visit our holy sites....its a part of jerusalem that will never be given up. East Jerusalem was offered before....in 2000
 
 
but in practical terms, if not having it as your capital avoids endless conflict, isnt it worth sacrifisng that largely symbolic gesture? If relocating embassies and changing capital names on the CIA factbook quell a lot of violence, then surely its a concession worth making? Its the religious significance which is paramount anyway, capital or not.
