It didn't surprise me that the same Democrats that demanded and
celebrated Government intervention to stop the collapse of home loan
companies (by way of government takeover) would reject the same
government intervening to support the markets in the country.   Why?
It is becoming ever clearer that this is an election of socialism vs
capitalism.  Everywhere you see something that will benefit companies
and corporations, McCain is for it and Obama against it.  When you see
some kind of socialist government proposal...like governmental
healthcare...you find Obama for it and McCain against it.

Just take a few seconds to let it marinate, and you will see what I am
saying is true.  Almost EVERY proposal of Obama leads to greater
governmental growth and fulfills a socialist desire n
(support for unions, universal healthcare, government takeover of
humanitarian work, etc).  The things he attacks are almost all
capitalist (those dirty big corporations...those fuel
companies....those HMOs...etc).  Meanwhile, almost everything McCain
proposes leads to less government and more capitalist freedom and
growth.  The things he attacks about Obama is almost always some
socialist proposal.

This is East vs West in our very country in this election.
