DEZHOU, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- Few men at 51 can claim to be full of energy, but
Huang Ming is -- and it drives him into a state of excitement.

Excitement at the state of the environment; excitement at the roaring success of
his solar water business; and excitement at his new green housing project, where
homes are selling almost as soon as they're on the market.

The apartments in Dezhou city, in China's eastern Shandong Province, are being
snapped up despite costing double the local average rate, he points out.

The energy-efficient buildings are the latest development in his green dream,
backed by his Himin Solar Energy Group empire, the world's largest maker of
solar water heaters.

"My dream is quite simple: leaving our offspring blue skies and white clouds and
saving limited resources for their benefit," says Huang, president of the
Dezhou-based group.

After rushing back from a meeting in Ji'nan, the provincial capital more than an
hour's drive from Dezhou, Huang arrives at the company reception room at about 8
p.m. for the interview.

He talks proudly about his plans, the heart of which is Utopia Garden, a state-
level, energy-efficient building project under construction since September
2007.

Dapperly dressed in a neat shirt, casual suit and black and red- striped scarf,
his hands move energetically to emphasize his words.

The first four of the 12 apartment blocks, between 12 and 18 floors, sold out
after sales started in October he says, refueling himself on a dinner of cake.

The buildings, which boast an energy consumption rate at least 65 percent lower
than normal homes, have solar-powered heating and air-conditioning systems on
the roofs. Power for lighting in the public areas and gardens will be produced
by photovoltaic devices.

Huang started the Utopia Garden project despite skepticism that a solar water
heater maker could be a developer. "A major factor pushing me into the property
market was the frequent refusal by developers to install solar water heaters on
their buildings."

Property developers don't bother to add value to homes by installing energy-
efficient facilities because apartments are sold before construction, Huang
says.

"I'm saving the country in a devious way," he jokes.

Buildings account for a third of China's total energy use, and energy-efficiency
goes far beyond just installing solar water heaters.

Huang envisions the Utopia Garden project being replicated in Hangzhou, Qingdao
and Wuhan. However, he says, solar water heater manufacture will always be his
main business despite the property business expansion.

Himin's own offices are a model of solar technology. The building, already a
landmark in Dezhou, is covered by solar panels on the outside and its windows
are equipped with highly efficient heat-absorbing glass.

Steve Sawyer, secretary general of the Global Wind Energy Council, said: "The
level of enthusiasm and almost messianic zeal with which he (Huang) is pursuing
the goal is very unusual."

Huang, a fluent English speaker, met Sawyer in Vienna at a global conference.

It has reported that most of his employees fear him as he pushes relentlessly
for higher standards. In the company's early days, Huang put a card on each
desk, urging his employees "to learn the persistence of Japanese and prudent
manner of the Germans," according to a report in China New Time magazine.

Chinese media have given Huang many nicknames -- solar madman, ambassador of
renewable energies, sun king and solar patriarch -- for his contribution and
perseverance in promoting solar energy use.

However, few are aware that his energy expertise began in the oil industry more
than two decades ago.

After graduating from the China University of Petroleum in 1982, Huang became a
drilling and research engineer in an institute in Dezhou. His visions of a green
future were nurtured by his teacher's remark that "the world's oil reserves will
run out in 50 years."

The birth of his daughter in 1986 changed his destiny and led to his decision to
shift to clean energy. "She is so adorable and I feared she would have no blue
skies and white clouds to see when she grew up."

Huang made his first solar-powered water heater in 1988, inspired by a book
titled Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes written by William Beckman. Seven
years later, Huang set up Himin, whose Chinese pronunciation is also "Huang
Ming".

Sales were initially tough as solar water heaters were new to Chinese and the
public had little understanding or awareness of environmental protection and
energy-saving.

With staff in a mini-bus painted green, Huang drove through major cities to
promote his product in 1997. The bus, emblazoned with the slogan "You should use
a solar water heater to save the blue sky and white clouds for the children,
even you don't choose Himin," covered more than 80 million kilometers.

Himin has expanded rapidly since the Chinese government stepped up efforts to
promote energy efficiency and cut emissions. In 2008, the company sold 3 million
square meters of solar panels, exceeding 10 Bird's Nest Olympic stadiums in
area.

Although Himin's solar water heaters are not the cheapest on the market, ranging
from more than 2,000 yuan (292.8 U.S. dollars) to around 6,000 yuan for a basic
model and up to more than 30,000 yuan for a more sophisticated heater, it topped
domestic rivals with technology that enabled the heater's use even in rainy
weather.

Himin holds more than 10 percent of China's solar water heater market, ahead of
major domestic rivals LDK Solar and Suntech Power and more than 5,000 other
manufacturers in the country, says Huang.

His personal fortune is estimated at 2.05 billion yuan and he was on the Forbes
China Rich List 2009 released last month. He is considering an A-share initial
public offering for Himin and overseas listing in 2010.

Huang has set a target for an annual increase of 15 million square meters of
solar water heaters before 2015.

At the end of last year, China had more than 130 million square meters of solar
water heaters, accounting for 76 percent of the world's total, and saving 300
million tonnes of standard coal equivalent in energy consumption, which would
produce 200 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, says Huang.

As vice president for industry at the International Solar Energy Society, Huang
was invited to the Copenhagen climate change conference.

He says every government in the world should focus more on climate change, but
"if tackling climate change becomes something only done by government delegates
at international conferences, no matter how many Copenhagen summits we hold, it
won't work."

Individual efforts are needed and if the construction, transport and lifestyles
can become more environment-friendly and energy- efficient, the world could
evolve from the fossil energy era to new energy era in 30 to 50 years, he says.

At the International Solar Cities Congress next September in Dezhou, Huang will
share his green dream with other participants and deliver a speech titled "I
have a dream."
