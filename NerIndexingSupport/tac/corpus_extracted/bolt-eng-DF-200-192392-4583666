Everybody knows who I am

  I'm telling Nas about this!
Seriously that was sick!
 
 
One Direction is my erection
harry for president,this an election
they aint gay, no homo, correction
love and enthusiasm, total infection

(tell him Tupac wrote it)

second part was actually reasonable, although 'gotta' ruins a pretty decent line.
 
 
Now this is a story all about how
my life got flipped, turned upside down
and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I become the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In west Philadelphia born and raised
on the playground is where I spent most of my days
chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
when a couple of guys who were up to no good
started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom scared
and said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
the license plate said 'FRESH' and it had dice in the mirror
if anything I could say that this cab was rare
but I thought man forget it yo homes to Bel-Air
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
and I yelled to the cabbie yo homes smell ya later
looked at my kingdom I was finally there
to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
 
 
 
One Direction is my erection
harry for president,this an election
they aint gay, no homo, correction
love and enthusiasm, total infection

i thought u were gonna be serious!! (from ur pms..)
=/

guess im stuck with myself
 
 
 
you deserve negging for that

haha, yeah sorry about that mate! but its just for a laugh so appreciate
first negative feedback from a possible fan....well that's my EMI gone down the pan  
 
 
"Check me out, I'm a lyrical G,
I wear boxers so my testicles are free"

Now on a scale of N-dubz/ Tinie Tempah to Nas/Big L, how you rate "ma barz"?
 
 
Food food, all I want is food
From a fattening kebab to something nutritiously good.

Idiots will take the p1ss out of you, but it's because they don't understand. Not just anyone can rap or even write it. You need to learn similes, mutli's, wordplay, punchlines etc. Structure your verse.

E.g

the cat jumped high,
the plane went by,

that is crap. Not only because it's boring, but because there is one rhyming word at the end of the sentence.

You should be aiming for;

call me jigsaw cos i test~your~life,
i'm twisted metal like a messed~up~knife,

Those are multi's. Test / life rhymes with messed / knife. (the middle word doesn't have to rhyme).

OR

go for a punchline like;

i couldn't wait to get big and blow up, kid,
so i grabbed a nuke and taped it to a small boys lunchbox lid

(not the best but you get the idea)

PM for advice
 
 
Forget about the rhyming for the time being, just make sure you get the rhythm right so it flows off the tongue without sounding forced.
 
 
PM me lol
 
 
Hey tambourine man
You're just a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man.
Oh, your majesty!
Come on forget the King who... marry me!

The world.. is... collapsing around my ears
I turn up my radio
But I can't hear it.

Check it out y'all

It was 20 years ago today
That Sergeant Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
(For a while y'all)
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I humbly introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's ****** ******* Lonely Hearts Club Band

What are you saying
What are you playing
Who are you obeying
Day out and day in?
Baby, baby, baby, baby
That stuff is driving me crazy
DJs communicate to the masses
Sex and violent classes
Now our children grow up prisoners
All their lives radio listeners.

Ah you know you talk so much you're twisting my melon man.

With apologies to The Byrds, Christina Aguelira, Spin Doctors, KRS-One/R.E.M., The Beatles, Happy Mondays.
 
 
Bam Bam Do Wop, You ain't got to talk
I see your dilemma, about the Hip Hop
You're aching and stressing, girl you just stop messing
there's one thing to do, it's get with the groove
so draw out a pen, this ain't the end
just follow your heart and you will go far
write til you're bored, hijack a ford
drive it around, til you get down
continue to flow, now you can go
and write that rap up, it's just rhythm and flow...

Good luck

If you've written any kind of rap, and are white, you are merely an undiscovered Eminem.

Also, stop trolling your foot. Its unhygenic.

1,2,3
Look at me
I the best there can be
Can you not see?
You will pay me a large fee
I'll take it and you'll be like "jee"
I'll open the door with my key
I'm a dinosaur like Barney
Soon I'll have to go pee
It's cause i drank a lot of tea

This stuff's straight fire, yo.

A model of a private airplane that these rich folk fly around in
 
 
because clearly of all the place on the internet to find help on rapping, TSR is the place to go...
 
 
 
'Tis a plane m'dear.
 

 

Aha! And yet still, the song makes little sense.
 
 
One direction, what a dumb selection,
Of pretty boys who sing but certainly not the best in,
What they claim to be, just wait and see,
In 10 years they'll be taking orders at KFC
 
 
 
Ah ignorance... happens to the best of us

 

  I'm a massive Hip Hop fan, can't one have a little joke without being demoralised? Oh...I guess not ok...  
 
 
Learning how to write a rap takes alot of time, since you have to know about; multi's, wordplay, similes metaphors, structure, variation of rhyme schemes and flowing over different beats. Then there's freestylin' which takes so much practice to manage, I can hold down a freestyle but I can't keep on the same topic for very long and I practice couple of hours a day. Been writing raps for about 4 or 5 years, if have you any questions feel free to ask, I can post some my lyrics if need be.
 
 
Isn't rap just a dictionary throwing up?
 
 
X-Factors One directions put the whole game in controversy
Their silly mc voices left the waters all murky,
At the age where yungas lax in the park till dark,
they got haterz jumpin at 'em like egyptian sharks
