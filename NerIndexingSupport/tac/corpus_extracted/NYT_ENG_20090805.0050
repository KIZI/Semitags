One too many cooks and books don't spoil Julie & Julia but
certainly load too much on director Nora Ephron's plate.

Her movie gets its title and too much inspiration from Julie
Powell's blog and later book during a year in her feeble life
making 524 recipes perfected by culinary icon Julia Child, whose My
Life in France chronicled an indomitable spirit.

If they had ever met, Julia might order Julie to tend to matters
outside the kitchen first  and Ephron to stick with the more savory
subject.

In every regard, Child's story trumps Powell's. Ephron insists
upon flipping between them. Returning to Meryl Streep's spot-on
impersonation of the late, lumbering chef with her constantly
thrilled, trilling voice is always preferred. Julia's story boasts
the finer complements : a wonderfully droll performance by Stanley
Tucci as husband Paul, the joys of discovering postwar French
culture apart from cooking, and a life worth telling.

However, Julie's depressing job as a post-9/11 support staffer,
a bland husband and their cramped Queens apartment get equal
attention. Amy Adams plays Julie, an uphill struggle for the
actor's spunky likability. She's mostly stuck with welled eyes and
kitchen pratfalls, a rare occasion seeming replaceable in a role.

If any film ever needed a fantasy clash of past and present,
it's this one. Ephron has a chance late in the movie, when Julie
learns that aging Julia said unkind things about her blog in an
interview (apparently seeing then what Ephron is blind to now). How
about a dream sequence uniting the women in Paris for wine and
Julie's whining? Julia would set her straight, and possibly the
movie.

Instead, Streep's uncanny performance never returns, at a point
when Ephron's previous parallel stories in Sleepless in Seattle and
You've Got Mail converged. The filmmaker remains faithful to a
fan's gimmick that even the object of adulation dissed. We're left
with resolving Julie's marital problem that doesn't seem pressing,
and whether she'll ever debone a duck.

Like Julia, I'd prefer to look at the bright side of
circumstances. In other words, any scene set outside the United
States with Streep and Tucci creating a marriage unlike many in
movies. Paul's urbane personality perfectly meshes with Julia's
earthiness, sharing quirks and support with the other, relishing
their odd blend. She towers over him yet with doting posture; he
gazes up at her lovingly and sometimes lustfully.

Why a diehard romanticist like Ephron wouldn't focus more on the
Childs, amid such lovely Parisian period design, is puzzling. The
Powells are like a parsley garnish taking up half the plate.

Which leads to the food in Julie & Julia that sadly doesn't
make mouths water as other culinary-themed films have done. It
isn't enough to watch an exquisite gourmet dinner being served and
guests moaning with delight. Food is merely a prop here, not an
inanimate character as memorable as flesh-and-blood actors.

Ephron could've asked Tucci for advice, after his 1996 gem Big
Night made movie food a visceral delight; the ingredients and
precision devoted to a sumptuous timpano revealed much about both
the recipe and chefs, and preparing a simple omelet spoke volumes
for wordless actors. Julie & Julia begs for such sensual
detail.

No doubt foodies will gravitate to Julie & Julia, possibly
finding more to appreciate through predisposition to the topic. But
proof is in the pots de creme. Ephron's movie is one half briskly
whisked heavy cream and the other half Cool Whip. Even fast food
junkies can taste that difference.

      A foodie's take
      on the movie

St. Petersburg Times lifestyles editor Janet K. Keeler has been
hitting the boeuf bourguignon pretty hard this week with her own
project, the Janet & Julie & Julia Project. Follow along on
her Stir Crazy blog (blogs.tampabay.com/food) as she whips up Julia
Child recipes in honor of the movie. So naturally, she had a little
different perspective than Steve Persall when she saw the film.
Here are excerpts from her blog:

. "Get a babysitter this weekend. Call your sister, mother or
best girlfriend. Go see Julie & Julia. I promise you'll like
it. There are sex scenes.

. "I saw it at a screening last week and was thoroughly
charmed, especially by Meryl Streep. .?.?. (She) plays Julia with
all the lust that the 6-footer had for life. .?.? .

. "I liked Julie & Julia, not so much for what it says
about cooking, but for the hope it gives to women struggling to
find what they should do with their lives. .?.?.

. "Amy Adams is adorable (though I wish she was as profane as
the real Julie) and her contemporary angst will ring true with a
lot of Gen -Xers. "
