"Here's my strategy on the Cold War: " We win, they
lose." [RonaldReagan]

"The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the
government and I'm here to help." [RonaldReagan]

"The trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant;
it's just that they know so much that isn't so." [RonaldReagan]

"Of the four wars in my lifetime, none came about because the US. was
too strong." [RonaldReagan]

"I have wondered at times about what the Ten Commandments would have
looked like if Moses had run them through the U.S.
Congress." [RonaldReagan]
"The taxpayer: That's someone who works for the federal government but
doesn't have to take the civil service examination." [RonaldReagan]
"Government is like a baby: An alimentary canal with a big appetite at
one end and no sense of responsibility at the other." [RonaldReagan]

"The nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth is a
government program." [RonaldReagan]

"I've laid down the law, though, to everyone from now on about
anything that happens: no matter what time it is, wake me, even if
it's in the middle of a Cabinet meeting." [RonaldReagan]
"It has been said that politics is the second oldest profession. I
have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the
first." [RonaldReagan]

"Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short
phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if
it stops moving, subsidize it." [RonaldReagan]

"Politics is not a bad profession. If you succeed, there are many
rewards; if you disgrace yourself, you can always write a
book." [RonaldReagan]

"No arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenals of the world, is as
formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and
women." [RonaldReagan]

"If we ever forget that we're one nation under God, then we will be a
nation gone under." [RonaldReagan

Good quips from a man going senile. But leading the US isn't a 2nd
rate TV show or Reagan would have done an OK job.

Winning the Cold War wasn't too bad.

Lowering Income taxes giving income tax payers more oftheir oewn money
to spend for their own needs  and getting more revenue into the
Federal coffers - following the Jack Kennedy plan wasn't too shabby
either.

By the way, name one outstanding thing Bill Clinton was  directly
responsibile for accomplishing?

Yes, I believe Nixon should be credited for the things he
accomplished, but the topic was Reagan, the poser.

Gooze;

Is there some relationship between Federal income and national debt??

The greater the income = the greater the debt?

No, that was the photo op you ate up. YEARS of steady work by Nixon,
Ford & Carter had weakened it. It fell like the New Orleans levees
while Reagan POSED.

PEACH:

Way back in this thread, I asked you to name one outstanding thing
Bill Clinton was  directly
responsibile for accomplishing for the United States.

I think you forgot to answer the question.

ronnie had no more to do with ending the cold war than the presidents
before him, in fact, Gorbechev had more to do with ending it than
ronnie. ronnie more than doubled the size of government, the deficit
and the national debt. He cut taxes for the wealthy and raised them on
the middle and lower classes. That old republican tax cut myth will
not die in the mind of the true believers. bush sr. said ronnie
professed vodoo economics and he was right, however, ronnie was able
to confuse and mislead the simple minded 20%ers like you.

I don't believe Reagan was smart enough to think of those quips.  (He
was after all Irish!) He was just a nondescript actor. Someone else
wrote the words.  As in his previous career.
Still, one couldn't help liking the man. Unlike Bush the reptile.

lew, this is a thread about reagan, you started it, quit trying to
change the subject. If you want to talk about Clinton start a thread
about Clinton.

ronnie was a likable dunce. The only reason the saint ronnie has the
stature he does now is because the conservatives have no one else to
worship. ronnie had his index cards in his pocket and nancy by his
side to keep him on subject, otherwise he would have been like bush
2.

Ah, the myth of the shrinking government under Reagan, a bedtime story
the Neowhacks love to tell, too bad it's not true. 99 times out of
100, what a conservative wants is to support an aristocracy. The "free
market" hyperbole, the hyper patriotism, faux morality, and bullshit
religious mantle are all just fluff to make the average American
believe they are on the common man's side. The real goal is to
increase the wealth of the top 10% by racking up debt that the average
American has to pay for, Reagan did it, Bush II (The Worst POTUS Ever)
is even worse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------

"The fact is that Reagan was able to push his tax cuts through both
Houses of Congress, but he never pushed through any reduced spending
programs.  His weak leadership in this area makes him directly
responsible for the unprecedented rise in borrowing during his time in
office, an average of 13.8% per year.  The increase in total debt
during Reagan's two terms was larger than all the debt accumulated by
all the presidents before him combined.  From 1983 through 1985, with
a Republican Senate, the debt was increasing at over 17% per year.
While Mr. Reagan was in office this nation's debt went from just under
1 trillion dollars to over 2.6 trillion dollars, a 200% increase.  The
sad part about this increase is that it was not to educate our
children, or to improve our infrastructure, or to help the poor, or
even to finance a war.  Reagan's enormous increase in the national
debt was not to pay for any noble cause at all; his primary
unapologetic goal was to pad the pockets of the rich.  The huge
national debt we have today is a living legacy to his failed Neo-
Conservative economic policies.  Reagan's legacy is a heavy financial
weight that continues to apply an unrelenting drag on this nation's
economic resources."

Reagan carved up large efficient agencies into smaller, more numerous,
disjointed agencies. That passes for 'smaller' government to some. It
isn't. The costs remain the same or increase while the services
DECREASE.* Baby Bush has followed his lead; it allows for good sound
bytes, but unsound government.

* I can cite some of Jeb!'s blunders for specific examples I have
personal experience with.
