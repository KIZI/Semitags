 Union Workers Earn More Than Nonunion 

Union workers are also better trained and enjoy a safer work environment. And....to top it off....the reason non-union workers are doing so much better is because their companies are trying to keep unions out.
 
 
 Indiana becomes 23rd right-to-work state | Reuters 

 FLASHBACK: Indiana's Last 'Right-To-Work' Law Failed So Badly It Was Repealed Eight Years Later | ThinkProgress 
 
 
Funny, how you guys claim to be pro choice until it comes to unions. And then you should be compelled to be part of the union.

I am personally all for increasing incentives to produce, to increase the rights of workers to choose for themselves whether they want to be in the Union or not. I like businesses being able to lay off employees who can't carry their weight.

The fact is we need to do all we can to get the corruption out of our lives. Unfortunately, many unions have corrupted American society, much as some corporations have corrupted it.
 
 
Since Indiana Republicans passed their anti-union “right-to-work” bill and Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) signed it into law, this should make the Indianapolis Super Bowl a little more interesting this weekend.
 
 
when people discuss "Right-To-Work" they only talk about it from a union point of view, because it limits the ability of unions to be able to hold companies hostage to extort wages.

but what people don't realize is it gives every employer the ability to fire anyone whenever they feel like it.

people need to stop talking about union rules when discussing this policy.
the Republicans are wrong to support this policy.

a lot of people think that California, the democrat state, doesn't have this kind of policy and they are wrong.
California used to be a "Right-To-Work" state but too many illegal immigrants started suing the state saying they had "Right-To-Work", therefor California changed the name to an "At-Will Work" state, which is the same or worse. (look it up)

this kind of policy has ruined jobs in California.
most people i know are temporarily employed.(even though the company doesn't say it)

Does "Right to Work" lead to lower wages and lack of benefits?

 

It leads to a balanced wage and benefits.

unions; everyone gets the same, no matter if they are hard or efficient workers.

right to work; The best workers get the best, the crappy ones get laid off or fired. The company can then thrive, expand and hire more people.

MY Union: Everyone gets the same wages and benefits through collective bargaining. DEFINITELY higher than non-union. Nobody gets raises or fired based on who he or she knows or who they're related to. Everyone pulls their share. If someone is a slacker we (union members) get rid of him or the company does since contract does not allow for slackers.

RW: Wages come through begging, who he or she is related to or whose ass they kiss. Can be fired at will and for no reason, even to make room for boss's nephew (I've seen it). Wages dependent on what the company wishes to pay at the time.

And just look at the pitiful performance of the teachers in this country.

Since the 1940s, 22 states have passed laws barring unions from collecting mandatory fees from workers for labor representation. Supporters, mostly Republicans, insist the measure helps create a pro-business climate that attracts employers and increases jobs. Opponents say the law only leads to lower wages and poorer quality jobs.

The evidence on the issue is abundant, but also conflicting and murky. The clearest conclusion, according to many experts, is that the economies of states respond to a mix of factors, ranging from the swings in the national economy to demographic trends, and that isolating the impact of right-to-work is nearly impossible.

 

 
Claim: Right-to-work brings more jobs to a state.

According to a study commissioned by Indiana's Chamber of Commerce, which supports the right-to-work law, employment grew 100 percent in right-to-work states between 1977 and 2008 but only 57 percent in those without the law.

 

 
Claim: Right-to-work decreases wages.

The Economic Policy Institute, which is supported by organized labor, reports that workers in right-to-work states earn $1,500 less annually than their counterparts in states without the law, based on a 2009 analysis of census data.

But right-to-work supporters counter with the chamber's study showing that personal income grew 164.4% in right-to-work states between 1977 and 2008 while income grew 92.8% in non-right-to-work states.

 

 
Claim: Right-to-work is designed to weaken unions.

Unions lose some paying members when workers' dues are made voluntary, according to data gathered by Georgia State University professor Barry Hirsch and Trinity University professor David Macpherson at UnionStats.com.

However, by far the largest blow to union membership and finances has been the manufacturing decline and the loss of millions of jobs. Even in states without a right-to-work law, union membership dropped 54.2% between 1983 and 2010, according to data from the UnionStats.com website.

 Right to Work for Less 

 

 Real Earnings Higher In Right to Work States | National Institute for Labor Relations Research 

 
The AFT union is one of the largest and most powerful affiliates of
the vast, 13 million-member AFL-CIO empire.

More than a dozen years ago, Dr. Nelson created a cost-of-living index
that confirms what top union officials shrilly deny: that employees real,
spendable earnings are higher in Right to Work states.

 

 
The index for 2000, the most recent one now available, shows that living
expenses for employees in non-Right to Work states are overall 4.4% higher
than the national average. Overall living costs in Right to Work states
are 7.1% more affordable than the national average. (see Table 1 on linked page)

 

 
When the 2000 mean weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary employees
in the 50 states, as published on pp. 30-35 of the 2001 edition of the
Bureau of National Affairs Union Membership and Earnings Data Book, are
adjusted for differences in living costs, the real earnings of employees
in Right to Work states are shown to be higher.

 

 
Not just the Nelson index, but also other nationwide comparative cost-of-living
indices such as the one supplied in David Savageau and Ralph DAgostinos
Places Rated Almanac, show that living costs are significantly higher
and, consequently, real incomes are lower where Big Labor wields forced-dues
power.

Did it ever occur to anyone that those higher Union wages may actually mean people are being overpaid for the job?? What?? Someone can't be overpaid, you say?? Certainly they can, and with that the company moves to a right to work state where people actually want to work or just move their operations to a country that appreciates industry and jobs.

I added in BLUE the Cost of Living Index to the BOLD ed states above. 100 is the US average, above means higher than the average cost, below means lower.

Funny, how you guys claim to be pro choice until it comes to unions. And then you should be compelled to be part of the union.

I am personally all for increasing incentives to produce, to increase the rights of workers to choose for themselves whether they want to be in the Union or not. I like businesses being able to lay off employees who can't carry their weight.

The fact is we need to do all we can to get the corruption out of our lives. Unfortunately, many unions have corrupted American society, much as some corporations have corrupted it.

 

does that include older workers who no longer can keep the pace they did when they were 20 years old?.....

 

It's usually not even a matter of whether or not they can keep pace. Much cheaper for a company to lay off an older worker before they can collect a pension and then hire some kid they can lay off when he gets closer to retirement age.
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, I visited the link once you posted it. Did I say your information was inaccurate or in error? No, I didn't.

What I SAID, was that it is not MY job to go search for a link to information YOU posted. it's YOUR job to provide the link. Not posting the link, and making somone ask you for it, makes people think you might be hiding something.

 

If I had been hiding anything, I would not have mentioned WHERE I got the information...that anyone could have verified by visiting the Census Bureau website. Puhleese.

 

again, it is not the readers job to hunt down a link in order to verify something YOU post, it's your job to provide the link. It's standard board etiquette. You obviously had the link, as you posted the information. You were just being a bitch by making someone ask for it.

 

LOL...that's right...I was just making you beg. Thanks for caving to my bitchiness.  
 
 
 
 
 
MY Union: Everyone gets the same wages and benefits through collective bargaining. DEFINITELY higher than non-union. Nobody gets raises or fired based on who he or she knows or who they're related to. Everyone pulls their share. If someone is a slacker we (union members) get rid of him or the company does since contract does not allow for slackers.

RW: Wages come through begging, who he or she is related to or whose ass they kiss. Can be fired at will and for no reason, even to make room for boss's nephew (I've seen it). Wages dependent on what the company wishes to pay at the time.

 

Complete and utter lies.

Unions covet lazy workers, that way no one looks like they are slackers. No one is encouraged to work hard.

Look, I've been around to damn long to fall for such horseshit. So tell the truth or stfu.

 

Why don't you blow me? I said MY UNION. And unless you've worked in a 24/7/365 operation like a power plant you would know that everyone has to pull their weight or get on down the road. But since you don't I can safely assume you're just talking out of your greasy ass.

 

So you belong to the one and only union that expects their members to work hard for their employer?

And you just happen to be posting here.

 

dude seriously. I'm in my 40's. Take your utter lies and hit the bricks.

Does "Right to Work" lead to lower wages and lack of benefits?

 

Right to work really means right to pay your workers substandard wages with no benefits
 
 
 
when people discuss "Right-To-Work" they only talk about it from a union point of view, because it limits the ability of unions to be able to hold companies hostage to extort wages.

but what people don't realize is it gives every employer the ability to fire anyone whenever they feel like it.

people need to stop talking about union rules when discussing this policy.
the Republicans are wrong to support this policy.

a lot of people think that California, the democrat state, doesn't have this kind of policy and they are wrong.
California used to be a "Right-To-Work" state but too many illegal immigrants started suing the state saying they had "Right-To-Work", therefor California changed the name to an "At-Will Work" state, which is the same or worse. (look it up)

this kind of policy has ruined jobs in California.
most people i know are temporarily employed.(even though the company doesn't say it)

 

The reason jobs are leaving the State of California has NOTHING to do with it being a Right To Work State (which it isn't)...it's because the Democratic Party that controls your state has spent it into insolvency. Jobs are leaving the State and people are leaving the State because it's going down the toilet and liberals keep right on pulling the handle as fast as they can.
 
 
It's all part of the right's "Prosperity through Lower Wages" program.

Louisiana is a RTW state... and while we have unions here, there really is no advantage to joining a union vs. not joining one.. the wages have stabilized pretty much. Most people here would rather NOT join a union.
 
 
 
 
 
Gotta laugh at that one.

Plenty of Public Sector workers get all of the retirement and benis paid for by the taxpayers. Probably loads of em in your State CA.

You should hear em scream when they are told that they will have to contribute to their own retirement and benis.

Thats what happened down here in Florida with FRS.

 

So prove it. Show us what states, counties or municipalities, provide ALL the retirement and health benefits to their employees.

My manager gets all his paid for. Did I mention that's not a union position?

 

Ignore Claudette. Just another case of getting all of the information from Rush Limbaugh.

 

Sorry to disappoint there Goose but I don't listen to Rush or talk radio. Period.

I don't watch Hannity and I never watched Beck.

So it has produced just the effect envisioned. Low cost, no benefit wages have driven down the union wages.......just like the conservatives intended

Rather than being able to bargain as a group, you are offered a take it or leave it proposition and the workforce as a whole suffers

It's usually not even a matter of whether or not they can keep pace. Much cheaper for a company to lay off an older worker before they can collect a pension and then hire some kid they can lay off when he gets closer to retirement age.

 

and companies like that should go out of business tomorrow...

No brainer.
 
 
Constitutional "rights" always seem to get in the way of the left wing agenda. Unions are OK as long as they don't force workers to join and they don't force workers to contribute to political agenda and life styles of the rich and famous union leaders.
 
 
 
 
Does "Right to Work" lead to lower wages and lack of benefits?

 

Yes.

 Union Workers Earn More Than Nonunion 

Union workers are also better trained and enjoy a safer work environment. And....to top it off....the reason non-union workers are doing so much better is because their companies are trying to keep unions out.

 

The training is a function of the company, not the union status of the employee.

The average business owner is a guy who likes to make decisions and do things his own way. This is not the kind of guy who looks forward to having to take orders from a union slacker who is plotting to slow down the productivity and increase costs unnecessarily.

The guy who wants to start a business and do things his way is the kind of guy who would move to a state in which he needn't be controlled by leaches who want to steal his money.

This kind of a guy would not set up shop in a place where he knew that his control of the workplace would be eroded by folks who have no interest in contributing to the health, profitability, growth and progress of the company.

This is the kind of a guy that would move out of California, Michigan and Illinois.

This is the kind of guy that creates jobs, wealth and solid communities.

Do you think Atlas Shrugged is a fantasy? Take a look at Detroit.
 
 
 
Since Indiana Republicans passed their anti-union right-to-work bill and Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) signed it into law, this should make the Indianapolis Super Bowl a little more interesting this weekend.

 

Yep, the mind numbed union thugs will probably be out in force ruining what could be a good time for the rest of the country.

A bunch of whiney little girls.
 
 
 
 
 
Does "Right to Work" lead to lower wages and lack of benefits?

 

It leads to a balanced wage and benefits.

unions; everyone gets the same, no matter if they are hard or efficient workers.

right to work; The best workers get the best, the crappy ones get laid off or fired. The company can then thrive, expand and hire more people.

 

MY Union: Everyone gets the same wages and benefits through collective bargaining. DEFINITELY higher than non-union. Nobody gets raises or fired based on who he or she knows or who they're related to. Everyone pulls their share. If someone is a slacker we (union members) get rid of him or the company does since contract does not allow for slackers.

RW: Wages come through begging, who he or she is related to or whose ass they kiss. Can be fired at will and for no reason, even to make room for boss's nephew (I've seen it). Wages dependent on what the company wishes to pay at the time.

 

As opposed to a union environment that just bleeds the company until there's nothing left to bleed, then watches it go under.
 
 
 
 
link?

 

I said it was from the Census Bureau. You've heard of them, right?

 Ranked from Highest to Lowest Using 3-Year-Average Medians 

 

If the average annual wage is high, but the number of jobs is decreasing, then the median wage means little.

Is there a study that shows the number of jobs over time in the heavily unionized states vs. the more right to work states?

That is the argument. Unionization may increase individuals' income, but the thinking is that the increase of the individual income results in a higher cost to the employer and lesser value of the finished product eroding competitiveness and ultimately eliminating the jobs.

Those who support unionism are usually the same folks who rant about the race to the bottom.

Having no jobs is the quickest route to that destination.

 Right to Work for Less 

 

Wow, a union site that says unions are good, I am impressed.
 
 
 
Since Indiana Republicans passed their anti-union right-to-work bill and Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) signed it into law, this should make the Indianapolis Super Bowl a little more interesting this weekend.

 

I hope the unions decide to ruin the Super Bowl. nothing I could say will have half the impact that unions trashing the single most watched TV event. That would cause such an uproar that every state will go right to work within a month.

Of course it does. Older workers that refuse to keep their value by progressing through the company and using their experience and knowledge should be fired. They are not worth the pay. The older workers I work with are in their 50s and 60s and can work circles around the younger workers without even breaking a sweat. Their experience makes them FAR faster than the younger ones.

Does "Right to Work" lead to lower wages and lack of benefits?

 

Only for those who can't get a job on their merits. When you apply for a job before you are hired you negotiate what your salary and benefits will be.
 
 
it is generally reported that average annual income in right to work states, the ones in which Republican business owners bribe Republican Politicians to fight unionization tooth and nail, are approximately $1,500 per year. That is to say that the average annual earrings per worker in states that Do Not Have "Right-to-work" laws is $1,500 per year greater than in states in which the elected officials do not fight the presence of Unions.

So there is your answer. Also, if you want to see how well it can work take a look at Germany, which I believe is not only the most heavily unionized country on earth, but also the most prosperous. They, the Germans, have better pay, better benefits, better leave policy, better training, and better job retention. Its their Unions that cause this to happen, and we could do the same here by elimination "Right to Work" laws that do nothing but encourage the race to the bottom among the employed.

The Union worker is always better off than her or his non union counterpart, just as a soldier is better off with his unit rather than alone and lost in enemy territory, just as a child is better off in the structured setting of the family or school rather than out on the streets alone, just as an elderly person is better off in the nest of the extended family than homeless and alone. Unions are the second level of human organization, right behind the family and right in front of community governance. We come together in the workforce for the reason that it is our last defense from those who would exploit our every twinge of muscle, who would divide and concur us on the workplace floor.

And those who would fight a union, what are they? They are the slave-traders of older times, they are the industrialists who move operations to China and India, they are the lobbyist in Washington, and they are the right wing Fascists who would trample on workers for the sake of money, money, and more money so long as it lands in their pockets.

Does "Right to Work" lead to lower wages and lack of benefits?

 

Destruction of unions is the method to lower wages across the board. It's that simple. Across the board = all white and blue collars.

Reducing wages makes no sense whatsoever nor does effectively support new economic growth. Instead it drives economic displacement.

Unions remove an entire segment of expense from the creative abilities of the managers to create efficiencies and maintain employment as they try to produce a better value product for their customers.

Expanding sales is the best way to maintain jobs.

From the link:

In 2001, Nissan workers in Smyrna rejected U.A.W. representation by a 2-to-1 vote, a result branded as a devastating defeat by the World Socialist Website. Back then, the New York Times called the results no better than in the unions failed attempt to organize the same plant in 1989.

So, to re-cap, it is your assertion that unions were broken by the evil capitalists who did not want to pay higher wages.

Did it escape your laser like focus that the death of unions has occurred because the competition from outside of our borders has forced the union shops to compete with the non union shops and the value of the union produced products was found wanting?

The reason unions have dissolved is that the costs that unions force are too great to allow a competitive product to be produced.

The choice is to create efficiencies or to buy it from China.

What is your choice?
