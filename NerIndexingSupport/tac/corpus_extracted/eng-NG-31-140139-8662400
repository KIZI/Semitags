PREDICTION LEAGUE 05 (City v Weymouth - Conference Premier League)

Last game: Exeter City 0  Weymouth 0

Only one entrant was brave enough to predict a nil-nil score line, so
congratulations to Daniel Evans, who earned the maximum 9 points available.

Although Gail Higgins picked up nil points today, she still heads the table,
but by only a single point from Ian Lamey who moves up from third to second
place.
Alan Lee joins Giles Beattie in third spot.

As is usual with a Home nil-nil score, not many points were picked up - with
many predictions anticipating a repeat of the corresponding fixture last
season. The
spread of 'Result' predictions was as follows:
Home win:  65
Draw:       5
Away win:   3
Total:     73

The 73 predictions sent in for this fixture amassed points as follows:
9 points  -  1
8 points  -  0
7 points  -  0
6 points  -  0
5 points  -  0
4 points  -  4
3 points  -  0
2 points  - 28
1 point   -  0
0 points  - 40

good stuff.

Although the attendance is described as disappointing I think it was twice
as many as any other game today!

working today either.

Unfortunately yes he was and not for the first time, then again no one had  a

  2007-08-27T15:54:00  
a particular pity as Mackie set up the key second goal on saturday by looking up and playing the right pass when closing in on goal.I had hoped that we'd see more of this new Jamie mackie

 
 
 
  "Steve" <steve.mo...@blueyonder.co.uk>  
  2007-08-27T16:00:00  
It really was a frustrating day. Mackie really does need to learn to get his
head up and look, and yet so far this season this has been exactly what he
has been doing, but today he was back to headless chicken Mackie of last
season.

Were it not for the ex Grecian in their goal it would have been another 4-0
City result. Basham I think needs to start a game or two now - surely he
must now be fit??? I think taking off Logan - well I wouldn't say it was a
mistake as I think Tis really does know what he is doing - but I would have
preferred Mackie off at that point (anyone listen to the commentary and
heard how many times his name was mentioned after this substitution) - Logan
to me is sooo much better than last season, and I think Artus must have
shaken off his bad toe (or whatever he had) as his play was really good at
some points today - he really will be a good player for the future -
wouldn't mind a season loan for him actually.

Having said all this - What a cracking season it is building up to be ! - 5
games in and unbeaten - Torquay 5 games in and unbeaten - both of us trading
blows at the top of the table, swapping places for fun. I think them joining
us in this league - or should it have been us joining them in theirs - has
really made a difference. 3rd and unbeaten in 5, we would have taken that,
but Torquay in front on just goals scored (not even goal difference) and
suddenly it's a bit different! - I hope we are both up there come Christmas
cos what a great couple of games they will be - and a sell out park to boot.

My only note of caution is, come the end of the season things will be
decided on a point or two - will we look back and rue this game as one we
could/should have got those all important 2 extra points from ?????

Keep it going City - it's going to be a fantastic ride this season !!!!

Same thing we were thinking August bank holiday weekend last year after
we'd just lost to Tamworth. That was the end of the world too wasn't
it!!!!

I'm not saying it's the end of the world. Far from it.

Our first season we missed the playoffs by a point - yet we drew to Halifax
on our first game of the season when we should have won by miles, so you can
possibly look to the first game of the season as the one that cost us the
play off spot.

Last season, had we had beaten Oxford away in the league, which we really
should have done, we would have been second and them fifth, or had we beaten
Tamworth in that game you mention we would have been third and possibly
playing Oxford in the final instead of Morecambe. We could already be 4
points clear if we hadn't slipped up at York and put away the chances today.
Nothing to throw the towel in over yet as everyone else has also slipped up
too, but it goes to show that every point in the league, be it first game or
the very last is equally as important, not just the run in, and being in
such a tight league and a difficult one to get out of, we really do need to
get the points in games like these when they are there for the taking.

I am really looking forward to the rest of this season as it really is
shaping up to be a great one. I never give in til the final whistle on the
final game and  I can't wait til the next game. This could be soo much
better than last season, and not a Wembley appearance in sight ! And I'll
say it (almost) again - hang on tight - this really is going to be a
rollercoaster ride this season, but a bleddy enjoyable one !

Appreciate that what you are saying is that every point is crucial and
this season the margins of success and failure look likely to be
extremely small, so any advantage needs to be grabbed with both hands.
I guess my general point was aimed at those who do think it was a
terrible result yesterday.

As one of those lucky enough to be there I was gutted more because we had so
many chances particularly late on and without question Jason (Exeter reject
chant worked then chaps!) Matthews was an absolute star for them and easily
the MotM.

You're right in the scheme of things it was still a good result but it was
also two points lost however I can't see us creating tat many chances again
and not putting away two or three.

Great journey back to London last night - not! FGW excelled themselves by
cancelling the Penzance to London service before ours so our train was full
to capacity when it reached Exeter let alone Tivvy Parkway and Taunton.

We stood all the way to Reading when we finally got a seat in first Class -
but still managed to play cards and enjoy some Tribute :>)

Yes it was disappointing as far as I was concerned. Prior to the game we
were top, one of the highest goal scorers in our division and a mere two
days after a win in a five goal game away from home. The weather was good -
and had been for days - and it was a Bank Holiday. Plus Weymouth bought 500
themselves too. Considering the previous game against York attracted a crowd
of 4200, add the 500 Weymouth fans and in effect no-one extra came to the
Weymouth game.

That, in my opinion, is piss poor to say the least. You have to wonder just
what more Tis and the team have to do to attract people in, as apparently
being unbeaten, top of the league and scoring goals for fun isn't enough
these days.

I must admit i thought we would break the 5,000 barrier, so yes,
would agree with you, disappointing, even though it was still the
highest on the day.

I know what you mean Ant and I do agree thought I think you'll find from the
records (Mike?) that this Bank Holiday fixture is always a badly attended
fixture hence why the conference, sorry Blue Sq Premier, was the highest
league playing - lots of parents on holiday with kids etc.

Maybe, but with Champions League and League Cup being played there's no
way there would have been league games on Monday anyway.

Maybe all the league cup games should have been played on Monday, except
those for TV.

It's a sad fact that only a minority of those who attend Football
League matches bother to go along and see their local non-league
team, when their own side are not playing. Gateshead are a good
example of that!! They struggle to get 300 through the turnstiles,
even when their illustrious neighbours are not playing. So much for
Tyneside always being described as a football mad area. Crap. That's
just one example however,

Can someone just clarify the following for me:

1       We had the highest attendance in the Conference (sorry, hate
calling it the Blue Whatever Doodaa) on Monday and one of the best
attendances overall, having been fortunate to have sustained pretty much
our numbers since relegation; and

2       We haven't lost a game in our first 5 of the season?

I need to check because I can't help wondering if, judging by the level
of negativity on Gnet, I've somehow misunderstood the facts?

We may not have lost in our first 5 but if you go on the last performance then we were poor. Despite having 3 forwards and playing a team who had only 3 points from 12 we did not look like creating chances until the last 15-20 minutes when they only had 10 men. Of course we are bound to have games over the course of the season when we play poorly (every club does) but that doesn't mean we should ignore them when they occur.

Maybe cos it's �7 to watch Unibond level football? I'm sorry but at
that level the football standard is fairly dire and �7 is a big wodge
out of anyone's budget - especially if you've pad �25-30 to watch
Newcastle.

Ten years ago you could get into a Div 3 game for �7 in the north
fairly easily, now you're paying that to watch the likes of Fleetwood,
Eastwood Town and Guiseley - it's no wonder people don't bother.

I think the lower league sides need to stop being greedy and start
thinking about how their pricing and local marketing might help. Surely
having 800 paying �3 each is better than 300 at �7 each?

No, indeed, we shouldn't ignore it when we seem to play poorly in a
game.  Nor am I suggesting we should all put on rose tinted glasses and
I promise you I'm not wearing mine as I write this.

What I am wondering though is why people seem to be focusing on the
negative.  I haven't actually looked back and counted, so could be wrong
(I am sometimes :-) ), but the amount of postings in relation to what
fans perceive to be a disappointing attendance for one game and the
result of that one game seems to have been higher than for previous
games when we have won and, maybe, even played quite well.  It's the
amount of negativity I was commenting on.  I just find the lack of
positive comments this early in the season a bit disappointing.

All is not lost yet, surely.

I think there's a difference between ground-hopping - collecting
grounds as if they were postage stamps and seeing parts of the country
you might not otherwise see - but to go week in week out for £7 to
watch dross at a very low level is pushing it somewhat.

And as Lee is based in London he'd be unlikely to be in Liskeard :>)

The point is they don't go even when Newcastle are away. To me, if
you are a football fan, y0u want to be at a game every week (if you
are able to), no matter where it is, or what league it is.

I know what I would rather do - watch three games at £7 - than one
at £25.

It's not dross though. I've been to four matches so far this season
(not counting friendles) and only one has been poor.

Ask Neil Le M - he went along to an FA Cup tie and enjoyed it.

We know you are not going to get world beating football, but it's not
just about the 90 minutes, it's about the day out as well and getting
enjoyment from what you are doing - otherwise you wouldn't do it.

Mike,

Do Newcastle fans claim to be football fans? Or just Newcastle ones?
I consider myself a football fan but rarely feel when I've been to games
not involving Exeter that I get any particular enjoyment from the event,
certainly not when I go by myself.

And before anyone says Cray Wanderers last season was excellent, twice,
but then the company was too.

Don't know the answer but am also not quite sure what the question is.

I think the point I am making is that if you expect more positive
comments to come from winning a match than negative points from losing a
match I think you are probably watching the wrong club. In fact I think
you'd be best off not supporting anyone. Negativity is inevitable when
you play poorly against a team who you are expected to win. I didn't
hear many Man Utd fans praising the team when they lost to Man City or
Tottenham fans say how well they played when they lost their first two
games. I believe football fans are by their very nature overly
optimistic about their teams performance before each game and more often
than not they will be dissappointed and inevitably fans will be
disappointed and will vent there disappointment on message boards and
email lists.

Matthew

"Ask Neil Le M - he went along to an FA Cup tie and enjoyed it."

Three other grounds visited this season so far watching other teams and
totally enjoyed all three.

The football in all three games was better than I expected and very
entertaining.

Enfield Town v Cambridge City
Haringey Borough v Wembley
Wembley v Haringey Borough
