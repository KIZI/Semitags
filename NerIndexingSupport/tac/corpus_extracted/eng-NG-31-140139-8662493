TRUST DIRECTOR FOR A DAY - ECFC V CRAWLEY

Unfortunately due to problems accessing the Trust Membership Data we had to
rush this through on the day of the match so apologies to anyone on the list
I was unable to contact or who was unable to come along at short notice but
I'm pleased to report that we did get a winner along, Adam Tripp, who
brought his father, Adrian, along with him.

Adam was number seven on the list but thanks to the generosity and
unavailability of those above him was lucky enough to have it offered to
him. Particular thanks to Dave Bennett who turned the prize down as he'd won
it before and thought it appropriate for someone else to go along.

The list of potential winners included Peter Evans, David Bennett, Heidi
Joanne Elizabeth Bastin, J. Stevens, Kevin Richard, Terry Hunt, Adam Tripp,
Tim Jones, Tricia Maunder, and Jeanne Jones. I wonder if Heidi is any
relation.

The spread of winners locations unusually included six Exeter based people
as well as three other people from other EX post codes namely Barnstable,
Exmouth and Sidmouth and only one person from outside Devon, that person
living in Malton, N Yorks.

The other very unusual thing was that not one of the people on the list had
an e-mail address in their data and all except one only had a home phone
number listed, no mobile or work number - the other one had no phone number
at all!

Cheers, Neil Le Milliere
