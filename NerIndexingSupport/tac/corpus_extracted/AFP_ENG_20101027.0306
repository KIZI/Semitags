The likely new owner of English football club Blackburn Rovers is an Indian
chicken company founded by a man known as "King of the Coop" which is looking to
expand overseas.

Venkateshwara Hatcheries, better known as Venky's, was established in 1971 by
B.V. Rao and is the flagship company of the 290-million-dollar VH Group now run
by his children from headquarters in the western city of Pune.

Rao's daughter and VH Group chairwoman Anuradha J. Desai said that owning
Blackburn Rovers would help diversify the company, which currently sells poultry
products, pet food and human health supplements.

"Football is a global craze and as the VH Group globalises, setting up feed
plants and hatcheries around the world, we believe we can benefit from being
owners of a major football club," she told Wednesday's Economic Times.

But fans hoping for a massive cash boost to bring top players and trophies to
the club -- as Russian Roman Abramovich did at Chelsea and Sheikh Mansour of Abu
Dhabi is bidding to do at Manchester City -- look set to be disappointed.

Desai said about eight million dollars would be made available for new players
-- far short of the 500 million dollars poured into Manchester City over the
past two years, and barely enough to sign one middling player.

"We will pump in whatever is needed but the main thing is to get the club back
into good shape," Desai said. "This is an investment and it will grow on its own
strength.

"We won't need to buy expensive players, we can always lease them," she said,
meaning to take players on loan. "We don't expect to be in the top five of the
Premier League. We will be happy to be in the top 10-12."

Venky's is best known in India for its frozen chicken nuggets and smoked chicken
sausages available in shops, and its proposed acquisition of an English football
club established in 1875 took many by surprise.

"We are a protein company, in the health business and there is synergy with
health and sports," Desai explained. "Now that we are going global, we need a
global sport, hence a football club."

Desai's brother Balaji Rao is the football fan in the family and he led
negotiations in England, she said.

The company is still run in the spirit of the late B.V. Rao, who is described on
its website as "King of the Coop" and "the father of poultry farming in India"
for his role in modernising the industry in the 1970s and 80s.

Among the company's products today are muscle-building creatine powders for
humans, Regale Pup chicken-based dog food and equipment for battery chicken
farms, as well as day-old chicks, hatching eggs and poultry feed.

The firm is also diversifying into film-making, and expanding in Vietnam,
Bangladesh and the Middle East.

If the 73-million-dollar deal to buy Blackburn Rovers goes through next month,
Venky's will be the first Indian company to own a Premiership side.

English football has a global fanbase and India -- while still crazy about
cricket rather than soccer -- has huge potential growth in television rights and
merchandise sales.

Blackburn, in the north of England, is an industrial town with a large South
Asian population.

It was the last club from outside the established big four of Manchester United,
Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool to win the Premier League, lifting the title in
1995.

But the club today lies just above the relegation zone, and has been looking for
a buyer for two years.
