 USA Steals Pages From Document? 
 
 
Some members are probably asking why another thread on this topic? Well, I believe a2k has grown enough that it can tolerate some overlaps. Also, I wanted to make certain all who would be interested got a chance to examine the news feature for themselves.
 
 
I didn't catch the earlier thread but I'll go back and see if I can find it. It is an interesting question though. I'm a bit confused at the moment as to exactly who had editorial control though. A quick peruse of the CNN site comes up with :

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Non-permanent members of the U.N. Security Council began receiving their edited version of the Iraqi weapons declaration Tuesday evening, more than a week after the United States and other permanent members got a full copy.

The rotating council members agreed nearly 10 days ago to allow the five permanent countries -- the United States, Russia, France, China and Britain -- get the unedited, nearly 12,000-page document.

After several days of studying the declaration and consulting with the five permanent members, chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix prepared what he termed a "corenarrative," a document numbering about 3,500-pages, to distribute to the non-permanent countries.

Among the recipients Tuesday was the representative of Syria, who repeated his nation's displeasure at not getting the entire, unedited declaration."

According to that Hanns Blix (Chief UN Weapons Inspector) had editorial control.
 
 
I've been looking at some other reference to the editing process. A tough slog. I must not be using a good set of key words.
 
 
Thanks, fishin. I am not, as you can see, about to talk on this before I become less confused.
 
 
another variant from  http://www.oneworld.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?root=129&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneworld.net%2Fips4%2F2002%2F12%2F20-2.shtml  (crossing fingers that link will work)

The edited document contained no ''sensitive'' information from the original, including details in the manufacturing process of nuclear weapons and names of companies that provided weapons to Iraq before 1990, the year it invaded Kuwait.

Last week, Syria also protested against a unilateral decision by the president of the Security Council, Colombian Ambassador Alfonso Valdivieso, to distribute unedited copies of the Iraqi declaration first to the United States, and then to the other four permanent members.

''The U.S. took the Iraqi report after pressuring the Colombian ambassador, and spirited it off to Washington,'' Phyllis Bennis, fellow at the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies, told IPS.

''The Bush administration then had sole control of the one full version of the report for almost 24 hours before it provided some version - we don't know how complete - to the other permanent members of the Council,'' she added.
 
 
Guys...good links for this story, which I'd not heard about yet. I'll see what I can dig up too.
 
 
Not precisely on topic, unless the topic is 'what the hell is the US up to?...

From FAZ... interesting article, but if you read the last four or five paragraphs, you'll find mention of the release of (at least) info on German companies providing to Iraq pre 90

As far as I remember (I'll look that up!), media reported that not only Germany, but other states (including the USA) exported to Iraq.

Still a bit (understatement) unclear who saw the full report, and who edited.
Should i be surprised?
 
 
It is still unclear. And, as you've probably found as well, rather difficult to find mention of this story anywhere.
 
 
Well, blatham, this story was r-printed quite often, giving the 'taz' as source.... and just pointing to the German firms.
 
 
Thanks for passing along the entire list, Walter. It's so very hard to be satisfied with one's viewpoint when we see they are formed from partial information.
 
 
Walter

I checked archives a number of the main US newspapers and (at least given the search parameters I used) couldn't find reference to this story.
