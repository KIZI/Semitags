Two Chinese gymnasts suspected of being underage at the 2000 Olympics have met with international gymnastics officials.

Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun, along with two Chinese gymnastics officials, met over the weekend with the International Gymnastics Federation's disciplinary commission. Dong and Yang are suspected of being as young as 14 in Sydney, where China won the team bronze medal and Yang won a bronze on uneven bars.

Gymnasts must turn 16 during an Olympic year to be eligible to compete.

The disciplinary commission will give its opinion to the FIG's executive committee at its Feb. 26 meeting.
