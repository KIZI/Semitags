Do you think Islam will eventually rule the world through non-violent means?

Discuss.

LOL at the neg reps for just asking a question!
 
 
ermm na
 
 
ROFLMAO
 
 
Inshallah one day
 
 
...LOL....

...LOL

... no  
 
 
Do you not think that is extremely arrogant to say? What happened to modesty?
 
 
That, sir, is impossible. if Islam 'rules' the world, there will always be opposition and if there isnt, then it will be acheived through violence only.
 
 
  Don't be silly.

More chance of this guy ruling the world...  
 
 
 
One nation. One empire? Israel?

ROFL.

p.s no direspect to Israelis youre sound just never going to happen more chance with wales lol

 

 
 
 
What? It's common knowledge that Suffolk will rise above the other inferior counties and rule the world with an iron fist.
 
 
Nah don't think so. They tried with communism and fascism in Britain and it didn't work. Can't see us British falling for Islam either somehow.
 
 
 
 

 

Blinkin hek mate there's no need for that.   You're going to punch me for that???????   You're taking this to a whole new level...

But we know it's going to happen. Of course there will be opposition but eventually it will dominate. The Anti-Christ has to die for this to happen.

However, Muslims know this won't last long, and when Jesus eventually dies, the world will return to what it was.

It won't happen any time soon. Maybe in another 500-600 years? Impossible to predict but most likely not in the next 100 years. So don't worry(!)
 
 
Mind control?
 
 
Except that it is far more likely that the more powerful nations of the world will become more secular as Post-enlightenment thinking spreads further, the technological advancements and scientific discoveries we have made put more emphasis on rationalism and logic and Religion is held with a high degree of skepticism.

This x 1000
 
 
Ridiculous concept. Quran rules against the kind of..Islamic Evangelicalism that would see Islam actively campainging to convert people non-violently on the scale that would be needed to displace Christianity.

Correct me if im wrong, but Islam does not have the.. enterprising nature of Christianity, mainly because in areas of Islamic control, religion rules with an iron fist. There is no question or argument to be had with Islam in Iran for example.

Same thing also means that Islam poses no threat to the rest of the world. It has its powerbase. All religions naturally want to expand. But I dont get the sense that Islam is trying to expand, expecially by non-violent means.

You build a Muslim community a Mosque in and English city, they go, kneel in it and be Muslims... They arent planning to take over the world in there..

Things only get nasty when you poke the Islamic world with a stick, or a artillery shell.

Jihad has three definitions.

 
an internal struggle to maintain faith
the struggle to improve the Muslim society
the struggle to defend Islam
 

You've nothing to be afraid of  

 
They tried with communism

 

Islam tried to do what with communism?
 
 
 
This x 1000

 

Unfortunately, they're on their way to do so. I hope it doesn't happen.
 
 
Who currently rules the world? There could be an endless debate so if you were to claim at one point that Islam would rule the world in the future, there would always be a huge amount of people who agree and disagree. Why not just say it now, because there will never be a unanimous ruler of the world and Islam is no exception.
 
 
Atheists already rule the world and we aint leaving any time soon.
 
 
The fist enemy that islam must defeat is none other than the almighty bacon.
If bacon would fall even the most ath-tastic atheist would waver.
 
 
No way this is going to happen. When within the next 50 years or so the proof for human evolution becomes so overwhelmingly strong, Muslims will look about as silly as young earth creationists do today. No offence
 
 
There's a difference between Islam, which is mostly peaceful (not completely) & Militant Islam, which is the form that holds a risk to our society. But for the moment that risk is fairly minimal.
 
 
 
Nah don't think so. They tried with communism and fascism in Britain and it didn't work. Can't see us British falling for Islam either somehow.

 

Tried what

and no i dont think so, atleast not anytime soon

They do?  
 
 
I lol'd at the title.

What a ridiculous concept. Islam already has its power base. Its nature isn't to plan and take over the world when everyone gathers in a Mosque you know  
 
 
 
So you do believe there is a possibility Islam will rule the world in the future?

 

Well, Muslims outnumbering Non-Muslims yes. But i dont consider that Islam ruling the world.  
 
 
Only after pigs have learnt to fly, mastered interplantery space travel and started colonising the universe.
 
 
Well, thinking back to the 500's and 600's, the Islam did spread due to the economic benefits there were in converting and becuase through the fall of the previous empire, the Arab empire gained much (economic) power in Europe...

So... for Islam as a religion to take over the world peacefully, there must be a significant social/political/economic benefit in converting.... which means either non-islamic nations need to collapse and be both economically and culturally absorbed into Islamic countries, or Islamic nations need to hold such political sway that other nations NEED to become heavily affiliated with them to survive or the islamic communities in non-islamic lands, whcih to my understanding are more settlements/communities for those already within them, need to offer something that the people around outside the community desire so much that it is better for them to convert...

and the way in which the world currently works, it seems unlikely!!
 
 
I will wait for that day. If I die before the day, it means it will never happen.
Agreed.
 
 
No-one can control the world.

The US is still yet to figure this out.

Word, its going to happen, fastest growing religion its not being arrogant stating whats going to happen based on certain pieces of evidence and what the person through their interpretation believes, in addition the OP said discuss.
 
 
 
So you do believe there is a possibility Islam will rule the world in the future?

 

While not directed at me of course. It's possible a meteor will hit the earth killing us all, it's possible members of religion X will one day massacre every non believer on the planet. It's also possible that one day members of religion X will have proof that is completely undeniable as to why their god is the actual god causing every single person on the planet to convert to that religion.

But it doesn't mean it will happen.
 
 
I wouldnt call it arrogant to say Islam will one day rule the world, its just called belief and faith.

I mean, loadsa religions have their belief that their religion will one day dominate the world somehow and then (according to Christianity, Judaism AND Islam) the Day of Judgement will occur.
Its just natural for a person with a strong faith in their religion to believe that so I dont see why some responses to this are "LOL" o.O

Also - the thing about "through non violent means" I feel theres some sort of sarcasm in that:L and therefore feel the need to clarify the fact that Islam isnt a violent or aggressive religion   As, is Christianity, Judaism or any other. Why would any religion preach about aggression and violent methods or ways of life? Illogical much?
 
 
No they won't. Holland will be the first country in Europe to start deporting immigrants and we will all follow suit. Geert Wilders look him up he don't take **** from muslims and dutch people don't either. We do though and i'll probably get some thumbs down as proof

If you look at the history of the expansions of faith they are normally born out of, or the cause of a great deal of blood shed. Judaism, Christianity and Islam have all been spread by the sword before.

But they've also been spread by the means of non violence before too.

Yes its disgusting to see religions of peace have messed up extreme people within it that misinterpret the initial teachings and go to the extremes of homicide, suicide, and brutal actions in order to "encourage" people to join their religion but this world is corrupt(but that's a whole new topic lol) and you get those types of people. Doesnt mean you don't get a vast majority of the opposite.

Come on, let's not lie, none of the the three Abrahmic religions is peaceful. They all have their share of violence, whether overt or not. You can harp on about context, but religions with passages about killing unbelievers, taking the wives of your enemies as slaves and the destruction of cities for not appeasing God are hardly tomes of peace, joy and love. They may have their share of peace, but that doesn't make them religions of peace.
 
 
 
I... Wha... Punch you...?  

 

Woops! I think there's been a misunderstanding. I thought the face palm was a punch...woops  
 
 
 
Well, I guess Satan has never lied to me before.  

 

Nope, because Satan is awesome and he does not lie.
 
 
none of the judeochristian religions would be what they are today without violence, they prob would not even exist.

so in answer no, no sole religion will ever rule the world peacefully, and i would bet money on no religion ever ruling the world through violence or other means
 
 
Over my dead body...
 
 
No they won't. They're more likely to get wiped out than take over the world
 
 
I really hope not..
 
 
when has islam spread with non violent means?

islam is spread through violent means only as its history of jihad proves.

take a look at the countries islam has conquered by the sword and how it destroyed the original cultures and peoples.

What semantic games exactly?

You said, ''islam is spread through violent means only as its history of jihad proves''. If you have read the other Wikipedia link given, you would see how your defintion of jihad is completely wrong.

Jihad is not a way to convert Non-Muslims to Islam through violent means, rather it is ''the primary aim of jihad as warfare is not the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam by force, but rather the expansion and defense of the Islamic state.'' (from Wikipedia).
 
 
 
Islam will eventually rule the world through non-violent means.

Every religion is just an idea.

well, so how can the state expand if not by conquest?

this is typical islamic double think. wage war, expand the state, but then say the aim is not war and is in fact peace.

btw, i did not suggest islam forced everyone to become islamic, it simply imposed dhimmi status on non muslims meaning that in the end most converted anyway.
 
 
 
xxxxxxxxxx

 

It says to expand the islamic state, yet not to convert. So either it forces the non-believers out or destroys them? or you don't have an islamic expance.

That doesn't mean that Islam spread through the sword.

Another Wikipedia link (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhimmi  ) ''Islam has become the dominant religion in much of the world primarily through three avenues. First, a gradual process of religious conversion for material and spiritual reasons.[19] Second, interfaith marriages, which require the children to be raised as Muslims. Third, and more recently, differing rates of population growth among the religious communities.''

Not necessarily.

Muslim Conquest: Mohammed preached Islam. Population of Muslims grew. Formed an army. Told other countries, accept Islamic law. Countries that refused, waged war. Muslims won. Muslims become leaders and lay their laws. Citizens in that land given rights (dhimmi) or either convert to Islam by choice.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_of_Islam 

Happened in majority of cases, not all, namely Kafiristan. Islam does not mandate in forcing Non-Muslims to become Muslims.

but the reality is, islam in almost all cases has been spread by the sword. that wiki comment link is so absurd it is laughable. it is to politically correct to mention the long long history of islamic conquests.

Why did you backup your 'jihad' point for spreading Islam with a Wikipedia link showing Muslim conquests then?
 
 
 
p.s no direspect to Israelis youre sound just never going to happen more chance with wales lol

 

Considering Israel has the backing of the US and indeed one of the strongest military forces in the world (which alone outrank the UK together), I think Israel would have a tiny bit more* of a chance than Wales for such an outcome.

*though of course it remains unlikely for either country on the whole.

look, i call islamic conquest down the centuries the jihad. maybe that is not technically correct, but i do not care. although, from the wiki source you provided, it appears even to be technically correct.

but the facts are, islam has been mostly spread by war and conquest and so it is not the religion of peace, let alone a religion of peace.

doubt it, Christianity and other faiths will continue to rise, along with atheists so a clash between the faiths will be hard to avoid (WW3 perhaps?). the worse situation would be a new "ottoman" empire, the best thing that could happen is religion slowly dying a long painful death.

either situation would take so long that me you and anyone reading this thread would die of old age.

This is conquest and destruction. You couldn't even use the reason that it was the other country that waged war since they where defending their own borders from Islamic rule. This is not non-violence no matter how you cut it.

Even if you could claim it doens't not force non-muslims to become muslim it still tries to enforce its law onto other countries that nither need nor asked for it.

No you're not correct still. Islam was introduced into regions by Muslims through either conquests or through preaching most of the time. It didn't spread because of war & conquest. Look at East Coast of Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia, no conquest was waged by Muslim armies, yet they hold significant numbers of Muslims with Indonesia being the mostly populated with adherents of Islam. Muslims ruled India for ~1000 years yet 80% of the population is Hindu. Similarly, Muslims ruled Spain for ~800 years yet 73% are Catholic Christians. Muslims ruled Arabia for 1400 years yet 14 million Arabs are Coptic Christians.

I wasn't trying to 'cut it'. I applaud you for understanding because all I was simply trying to do was correct the definition of Jihad in the context of spreading Islam.
 
 
I'll not be alive to see that, but if it happens then technological advancement will be all but halted, just as in the dark ages here. UNLESS the form of Islam which takes over is quite liberal and as it used to be long ago, when Islamic scientists did rule the world, but the Islam we see in strongly Islamic nations is such stricter and controlling..it doesn't support scientific progress.

that because india was partitioned. pakistan is virtually 100% muslim and islam is the second most practiced religion in india.

but, just because muslims do not convert all the territories it conquers it does not matter. the facts still remain its spread on the whole has been a direct result of conquest.

also, if islam is the religion of peace, why are muslims going around conquering other people like in spain and india? why did they attempt to sack europe and russia?

world's fastest growing religion- ( many religions in the world claim this if you look this up)
but my point is even if its true, the main reason is that Muslims have more children on average than other religions, especially in middle east and Asia. So all that is happening is that young children are being brought up as Muslims when infact they are not old enough to think for themselves.

Are you saying the Muslims conquests of Spain and India brought more harm than good? Because if you are that's extremely foolish.

I suggest you read up about the enormous advances made in things such as architecture and medicine and minority rights in Spain as well as the Mughal Empire was was LARGELY extremely successful.

What religion are you? Would you like to give me an example pre-20th century of where a powerful country didn't seek conquest?
 
 
If it ever seemed likely the west and/or Israel would just lob a bit of "instant sunshine" around the mid east and put Islam firmly back in its natural constituency, the dark ages.

Muslims conquered lands. Islam was introduced. If it spread, it was because of conversion by choice as that what Islam sanctions in the majority of cases not because it was conquered.
 
 
 
Nah don't think so. They tried with communism and fascism in Britain and it didn't work. Can't see us British falling for Islam either somehow.

 

When was this Communist and Fascist Rule in Britain then?  

And OP, I disagree with the statement in question for the reason that it is, as we say in the world of Historians, "absolute twiddle".

the non muslims in these conquered lands were treated as third class citizens by cruel arab supremacist rulers. even berbers in spain who were muslim themselves were second class because they were not arab.

this opens up a sub debate about the issue of arab supremacism and if the whole islamic conquest period was islamic or arab in nature.

but, my point is it is silly to call islam the religion of peace when clearly so much war has been waged in its name. christianity is not perfect either but it does not give itself this ridiculous name.

Please tell me: Where the rights of minorities such as Jews better when the Muslims were in power in Spain or the Christians?

Funny how you missed my point about the Mughals.

As I said what is your religion?

you cannot justify islamic dhimmi status just because it is perceived that others treated people worse. also, minority groups in muslim spain were sometimes treated well and sometimes very badly depending on the ruler in charge at the time. after 800 years there were many periods of persecutions. the same for india.

yes, the mughals so i think the expansions were not just arab supremacism and have lot to do with jihad itself. however, i just think it is an interesting sub debate as arabs ruled with racial supremacist attitudes. i am not so versed on the attitudes of the mughals.

as for my religion, i will say i am neither christian or islamic or jewish so i have no vested interest in this debate. i like to keep it to myself.

I love it when a dumbass responds to my posts  

Globally, The World Christian Database as of 2007 estimated the growth rate of Christianity at 1.38%. High birth rates and conversions in the Southern Hemisphere were cited as the main reasons for the increase.
Pentecostalism, described by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life as a group of charismatic movements, has grown, according to researchers, from 72 million in the 1960s to 525 million in 2000, though some have criticized these numbers as defining Pentecostalism too broadly. According to a 2005 paper submitted to a meeting of the American Political Science Association, most of this growth has occurred in non-Western countries and concludes the movement is the fastest growing religion worldwide.
In Vietnam, the US Department of State estimates that Protestants in Vietnam may have grown 600% over the last decade. In Nigeria, the numbers of Christians has grown from 21.4% in 1953 to 48.2% in 2003. In South Africa, Pentecostalism has grown from 0.2% in 1951 to 7.6% in 2001. In South Korea, Christianity has grown from 20.7% in 1985 to 29.2% in 2005 according to the Pew Forum."

semantic games i think you are playing. i am simply pointing out that i slam cannot be considered a religion of peace given its history of conquest and the fact that war is actually preached in the religion.

 

Oh for cheese's sake, thats the most pathetic thing anyone can say about any religion to be fair!

Why would ANY religion preach about war unless its liek satanism or somet?! ITS SO ILLOGICAL.

How on earth did you come to the conclusion that "war is actually preached in this religion"

Would appreciate it if you provided some hard facts here, thanks.

islam preaches war it has many verses that preaches war and jihad.

what did you think i meant.
 
 
Just like Catholicism 1000 years ago...

Islam is in its aggressive phase in history. Eventually it'll go through so many splits and reforms that it will be no more powerful than Catholicism (that went through this phase 1000-500 years ago). It'll eventually be no more influencial then Christianity is in politics today.

It'll just take time...

islam has been in an aggressive phase from the 7th century. it is fallacy to compare it to christianity when the two doctrines are completely different. islam is more like a political ideology than a standard religion.

you comment is pie in the sky thinking of the worst kind.
 
 
 
Islam will eventually rule the world through non-violent means.

Discuss.

 

OP you just made a brash comment and then said discuss can you please explain your opinion so theyre will be a bit more basis for a discussion

This coming from someone who admires a man that wished to bring India back to the bronze age.

You're either a Christian apologist who didn't like my comparison (trust me, early Christians were brutal to the pagans they replaced), or you are a Hindu, a religion that has never seen eye to eye with Islam (India/Pakistan).

Their doctrines are not as different as you think, like all religions they vary, but there are many similarities.

Thats still not hardcore facts.

I ask again, why would any religion - and one that includes millions of converts over the years and altogether a large number or people within it - preach for any sorts of unjustified war.

Also, the term "Jihad" is often misinterpreted, by extremists who react upon it and others who then blame Islam as a whole for these extremists acts and believe fully that the term Jihad is basically a bunch of tossers who go around killing anyone they think that doesnt follow their beliefs.

There are two terms of Jihad; Lesser Jihad and Greater Jihad

Greater Jihad being the spiritual struggle between good and evil within you leading onto how God judges you on the Day of Judgement
and the efforts of a believer to live their Muslim faith as well as possible. [  http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religi...jihad_1.shtml] 

Lesser Jihad : a Holy War.
Now dont get too ahead of yourself here, there are reaaall specific terms as to how one may classify a "Holy War" and how a Muslim can go ahead with a "Holy War"

Islam is not a pacifist religion, like many other ones, however when it does allow non pacifist methods it has to be in extremely specific situations, things like:

-It has to be justified Islamically (cannot be for minor disputes such as "You ate the last malteser" or against a race or religion or a tribe of people for no apparent reason - but say if a group of people were being discriminated upon according to race, religion, gender, disabilities, age etc etc).
-Peaceful methods have not been attempted first - had to be the complete last resort.
-Women, children and elderly may not be harmed at all.
- The environment cannot be harmed, so it has to be done in a completely isolated area such as a desert or somet.
-Both sides have to be armed, meaning one cannot fight the other if the other is unarmed
- The war has to be defensive - not aggressive. (Backs up what I said about how it has to have a justified reason and it is based on defending a group of people)
-Cannot have a purpose of gaining land/power
-Trees/crops animals etc cannot be harmed/damaged/destroyed
-Cannot damage or destroy or harm places of worship or homes

All these things have to be applied and checked with by a religious leader before a "Holy War" may proceed.

Knowing this, you see what gets me when people misinterpret the meaning of Jihad and then go ahead and kill innocent people based on the fact that they are not Muslim. To be fair, doing what they do, and believing what they do, I highly doubt theyre considered Muslims at all in God's eyes - cos that is NOT what Islam or any other religion preaches - but then again God is merciful and honestly I can't be one to judge, I just hope all these misinterpretations on their behalf and what they believe slowly dies out someday (soon hopefully) and they understand what the genuine meaning of Islam is :/

So instead of blaming a religion as a whole, how about you do a bit of research (instead of blindly believing certain media articles or w.e or discussions with other people who havent exactly done their research and basically following the crowd) and then come to a judgement on whether this religion can be blamed as a whole based on the fact that there are a minority of illogical and inhumane fools who go around preaching the completely wrong ideas of Islam.
 
 
most of you don't even know about islam ?
its the only true religion ( there is scientific proof the quran was the first to discover embroynic development and it contains the exact same definition that einstien gave for the big bang theory ) it can't just be a concidence.

the bible wasn't even written by jesus's diciples it was written by four men after jesus's death so why would you worship them they could easily of misinterpreted information and how can jesus be possibly the son of god the father and the holy spirit.the bible has to many contradictions whereas muslims believe in the same god and jesus but in a more understandable possition a prophen not a 'ghost'.

theres a reason why islams the fastest growing religion stop stereotyping muslims and actually try and research about it before you make judgements.
your right its unlikely that islam would rule when the jewish media is influencing on people to hate it.

i suspect you are using feel good generalisations to make this comments. islam is not the same as christianity.

it is more akin to a political ideology that lays out its own system of law and way of life.

you seem like the above poster you want to feel good and not try and judge one ideology over the other but in reality things are different.

to be honest i can tell you are a bigot on this matter as first you say it is not hardcore facts about war verses and then you post some touchy freely comments from the politically correct bbc.

the war verses are facts in the koran and then there is the hadith which teaches war also. you are naive clearly.
 
 
 
Do you not think that is extremely arrogant to say? What happened to modesty?

 

All Muslims are arrogant. In fact most Indians/middle easterns are incredibly arrogant.

Saying that there are many verses in the Quran that preach war and not providing those verses isnt hardcore facts. Give me a/some verse/s and a link of the website you got it from(as you get sites that are phonies and then you get the actual ones with the actual meaning)
So no im not a bigot. And "touchy feely comments from the politically correct bbc" expand on that?

Also, hadiths are made by people, not messengers of God, or from the Quran itself - therefore youre bound to get ones from different beliefs - i.e extremes.
But like I said, would appreciate it greatly if youd provide these apparent verses/hadiths  
And no, im not trying to "sound like" anyone here. Im voicing what I personally believe, not my fault youre too obstinate and arrogant, but hey lol, you get people like you in this world mehh  

Is this gonna be a pretty much useless debate here in which all youre gonna reply are criticizing/immature comments and not actually get anywhere?

Yep, Christian apologist.

Have you read the Old Testament? Namingly Leviticus and Numbers? Full of laws. 600+ laws in fact!

It's in the Bible. It's not anyone elses fault that the teachings in it are no longer followed because they are too hard.

if you are not even aware of the verses then it goes without saying you are just arguing from a politically correct view point that all things are equal just because that is the touchy feeling view.

from the very beginning of the religion in the 7th century it was an expansionist and war like movement. in roughly 300 years it conquered all of the middle east, india, north africa, spain, portugal, sicily and southern italy. again, this was just the first 300 years after the beginning of the religion. soon after it conquered all of old christian roman empire in the east. turkey. parts of europe and up into russia and into asia. the vast majority of its spread has come from the conquests.

if you believe this movement is a religion of peace you are either mentally ill or a someone who is living in fantasy land because you do not want to contemplate what it means to have this movement in large numbers in europe itself.

i suggest you do some studies on the violent history of this religion and how it galvanised its followers to conquer the known world by the sword.

no i will not say my religion on here. mainly because i want to avoid the type of argument you try and present here trying to deflect attention away from the point.

what has my religion got to do with this debate.

if islam was the religion of peace then why has it waged so much war in the name of islam? it makes no sense. you have to suspend reality to believe such things.

Because your views are obviously anti-muslim. I just was curious as to why this was so. I'm guessing Hindu, possibly Sikh or Buddhist.

It doesn't matter. I completely agree with the bolded. In regards to all superstition.

i am not a buddhist but just out of interest please point me in the direction of a buddhist inspired war?

this term 'the religion of peace' may actually apply to buddhism but it certainly does not apply to islam or any of the abraham religions. it is absurd to suggest so.

"Islam is the one true religion" - just an opinion. It has contradictions just like many other religions, and can't prove most of what it's beliefs are based on (which is why it's a religion, and not considered scientific fact).
I don't know why you've decided to talk down Christianity. "How can Jesus possibly be the son of God" - How can muhhumad possibly be a prophet who talks to a "God" that doesn't exist?
It's all just beliefs. You are entitled to your beliefs (it seems you're a Muslim, so you believe that muhhumad was a prophet, etc), but don't talk down about other people's religions/beliefs, because there's no extra proof that yours is correct and theirs is wrong.
There's no proof that any religion is right... Which is why there are agnostics, atheists, and those who just believe what can be proven by science.

You talk about people educating themselves and not judging Islam, but it seems that's what you do with other religions.
By all means, believe that they are wrong... But you don't actually have proof, so leave them to believe what they like as well.
 
 
 
[...]

 

Agreed. I find the arrogance of some muslims to have had quite a negative influence on the way I view Islam, and unfortunately, religion in general.
Let people believe what they wish to believe – rightly so.

I am aware of them - but liek ive mentioned twice now i think, theres a few sites and sources that have the wrong interpretations of the Quran. Just to make it more clear for you widdle mind, you get some sites/books where radicals themselves have made, some where people that are anti Islam who claim to be Muslim that have been made and then you get the actual meanings/translations from the Quran in some books and sites. Clear nuff?

No Im not mentally ill LOL, dude you must be quite oblivious to the world or just really arrogant to think any religion would preach war at all and then to believe that there arent gonna be extreme radicals that misinterpret fully what their Holy Books say in every religion.
Did not Christianity radicals start the Crusades, Rwanda or extreme radicals like the KKK or The National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT)...does not mean that THAT religion itself is a violent one or preaches violence methods. Theres a different between the religions initial teachings and then the followers interpretations yaknow  
Dude, they exist in every religion so dont go generalizing terrorism/war/violence with Islam just because weve got these stupid radicals trying to do God knows what in this current time.

Wow, youre pretty the naive one here tbh, i cba arguing with this now, you seem content with your outlook on life/religion in genera too much effort arguing over TSR when ive got exams going on-.- anyways Ima go back to revision   thanks for the... interesting.. entertaining damnit this was quite pointless=.= - au revoirr

please, get back to exams and leave these discussion to people who actually know what they are talking about are are not debating from the viewpoint of equality for the sake of the politicially correct feel good factor.

the crusades were a reaction to the conquests of the holy lands i must point out.

muhammad unlike jesus actually preached war. this might not square with your feel good mentality there you go.

like i said, it is silly to call any of the abraham religions peaceful but islam is the worse.

good luck in your exams.

yes, taoism can also be considered a religion of peace. and i have a great respect for the tao. such wonderful teachings.

yes, you have mentioned the sri lanka war but that is internal struggles and a bit different from the expansionist conquests of islam.
 
 
if we have to vote far right to stop the islamic conquest we will vote far right. tough times call for tough measures. a bit of deportation here and there wouldnt be no holocaust would it ?

It was still influenced (heavily) by opposing religous views.

I wouldn't call all of Taoism's teachings to be wonderful. I will say I'd rather they be the constitution of other religions (if religion is needed at all) than those found in Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism or Buddhism.
 
 
Is this one of those NOT jokes?
 
 
 
Mind control?

 

In a way...

They (muslims) dont MIND that islam is so evil that they have to lie to disguise what islam really is. - that means that muslims dont even MIND how evil it is themselves or MIND how evil that means they are.

Muslims dont mind if you say no to islam because muslims dont MIND if they kill you, after all, islam is a religion of peace and tolerance right... ahuuum

It also means something evil has their MIND(S) under control of course.
 
 
 
if we have to vote far right to stop the islamic conquest we will vote far right. tough times call for tough measures. a bit of deportation here and there wouldnt be no holocaust would it ?

 

Actually seeing as how many muslims in our countries, in polls show how much evil they want to do, under the banner of ahuum peace..

It needs more than 'a bit' of deportation.

.

 

No, not really. Most of the Holy Lands were under Arab control for more than 300 years prior to the Crusades.

The main reason for the Crusades was because the Byzantine Emperor wanted a mercenary/volunteer force to help him beat the Arab armies back in Asia Minor and requested one from the Pope.
 
 
Do you know one of the recent 'Messages of Islam' to us?

9/11

9/11 was the day, centuries ago that the last (MAJOR/MAIN) islamic (non taqqiya/lying) war, ie actual physical killing war, was defeated, at the gates of vienna. (Not forgetting all the places where muslims are fighting with weapons now).

I was more referring to the fact there will always be someone that will not accept the idea and therefore will create change. If change happens then the "rule" ends.

Funny how you mention the Quran. Although you may believe that it is the Quran causes all the problems in the world, it isnt, people cause problems by wanting everyone to see what they seea and doing it in any way that they can.

Yep I admit I dont know a whole lot about the history of other religions, and I still have no idea what in the world you mean by "politically correct feel good" people. But your arrogant self and your ability to downgrade other religions based on your false accusations and lack of hard proof makes it impossible for one not to get all pissed off at-.-

When did Muhammed(pbuh) ever preach war in an injustice manner? If it was a war to PROTECT a tribe or tribes that were being discriminated upon then I dont see where you are actually coming up with these ideas that Muhammed(pbuh) was for war and aggression or whatever.

Oh and dont try and sound patronizing towards me to boost your self esteem/confidence up on here - its pretty darn pathetic tbhh
 
 
 
Do you think Islam will eventually rule the world through non-violent means?

Discuss.

LOL at the neg reps for just asking a question!

 

I say no.
 
 
 
I'll not be alive to see that, but if it happens then technological advancement will be all but halted, just as in the dark ages here. UNLESS the form of Islam which takes over is quite liberal and as it used to be long ago, when Islamic scientists did rule the world, but the Islam we see in strongly Islamic nations is such stricter and controlling..it doesn't support scientific progress.

 

There are few 'strictly islamic' countries in existance today. One that can be considered so, is probably Iran. Do you think Iran is not supporting scientific progress?
 
 
 
Deny it!

The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers. Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding. Muslims who do not join the fight are called 'hypocrites' and warned that Allah will send them to Hell if they do not join the slaughter.

Unlike nearly all of the Old Testament verses of violence, most of the verses of violence in the Quran are open-ended, meaning that the historical context is not embedded within the surrounding text. They are part of the eternal, unchanging word of Allah, and just as relevant or subjective as anything else in the Quran.

Unfortunately, there are very few verses of tolerance and peace to abrogate or even balance out the many that call for nonbelievers to be fought and subdued until they either accept humiliation, convert to Islam, or are killed. This proclivity toward violence - and Muhammad's own martial legacy - has left a trail of blood and tears across world history.

The Quran:

Quran (2:191-193) - "And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution [of Muslims] is worse than slaughter [of non-believers]...and fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah." There is a good case to be made that the textual context of this particular passage is defensive war, even if the historical context was not. However, there are also two worrisome pieces to this verse. The first is that the killing of others is authorized in the event of "persecution" (a qualification that is ambiguous at best). The second is that fighting may persist until "religion is for Allah." The example set by Muhammad is not reassuring.

Quran (2:244) - "Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things."

Quran (2:216) - "Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not." Not only does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous, but it also contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self-defense, since the audience was obviously not under attack at the time. From the Hadith, we know that Muhammad was actually trying to motivate his people into raiding caravans with this verse.

Quran (3:56) - "As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help."

Quran (3:151) - "Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority". This speaks directly of polytheists, yet it also includes Christians, since they believe in the Trinity (ie. what Muhammad incorrectly believed to be 'joining companions to Allah').

Quran (4:74) - "Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward." The martyrs of Islam are unlike the early Christians, led meekly to the slaughter. These Muslims are killed in battle, as they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of Allah. Here is the theological basis for today's suicide bombers.

Quran (4:76) - "Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…"

Quran (4:89) - "They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks."

Quran (4:95) - "Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,-" This passage criticizes "peaceful" Muslims who do not join in the violence, letting them know that they are less worthy in Allah's eyes. It also demolishes the modern myth that "Jihad" doesn't mean holy war in the Quran, but rather a spiritual struggle. Not only is the Arabic word used in this passage, but it is clearly not referring to anything spiritual, since the physically disabled are given exemption. (The Hadith reveals the context of the passage to be in response to a blind man's protest that he is unable to engage in Jihad and this is reflected in other translations of the verse).

Quran (4:104) - "And be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy; if you suffer pain, then surely they (too) suffer pain as you suffer pain..." Is pursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of self-defense?

Quran (5:33) - "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement"

Quran (8:12) - "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them" No reasonable person would interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle.

Quran (8:15) - "O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end."

Quran (8:39) - "And fight with them until there is no more persecution and religion should be only for Allah" From the historical context we know that the "persecution" spoken of here was simply the refusal by the Meccans to allow Muhammad to enter their city and perform the Haj. Other Muslims were able to travel there, just not as an armed group, since Muhammad declared war on Mecca prior to his eviction. The Meccans were also acting in defense of their religion, since it was Muhammad's intention to destroy their idols and establish Islam by force (which he later did). Hence the critical part of this verse is to fight until "religion is only for Allah." According to Ibn Ishaq (324), Muhammad justified the violence further by explaining that "Allah must have no rivals."

Quran (8:57) - "If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember."

Quran (8:59-60) - "And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip (Allah's Purpose). Lo! they cannot escape. Make ready for them all thou canst of (armed) force and of horses tethered, that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy."

Quran (9:5) - "So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them." According to this verse, the best way of staying safe from Muslim violence is to convert to Islam. Prayer (salat) and the poor tax (zakat) are among the religions Five Pillars.

Quran (9:14) - "Fight them, Allah will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace..."

Quran (9:20) - "Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant." The "striving" spoken of here is Jihad.

Quran (9:29) - "Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued." "People of the Book" refers to Christians and Jews. This was one of the final "revelations" from Allah and it set in motion the tenacious military expansion, in which Muhammad's companions managed to conquer two-thirds of the Christian world in just the next 100 years. Islam is intended to dominate all other people and faiths.

Quran (9:30) - "And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away!"

Quran (9:38-39) - "O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place." This is a warning to those who refuse to fight, that they will be punished with Hell.

Quran (9:41) - "Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew." See also the verse that follows (9:42) - "If there had been immediate gain (in sight), and the journey easy, they would (all) without doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long, (and weighed) on them" This contradicts the myth that Muslims are to fight only in self-defense, since the wording implies that battle will be waged a long distance from home (in another country and on Christian soil, in this case, according to the historians).

Quran (9:73) - "O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination." Dehumanizing those who reject Islam, by reminding Muslims that they are merely firewood for Hell, makes it easier to justify slaughter. It also explains why today's devout Muslims have little regard for those outside the faith.

Quran (9:88) - "But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper."

Quran (9:111) - "Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Quran: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme."

Quran (9:123) - "O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness."

Quran (18:65-81) - This parable lays the theological groundwork for honor killings, in which a family member is murdered because they brought shame to the family, either through apostasy or perceived moral indiscretion. The story, which is not found in any Jewish or Christian source, tells of Moses encountering a man with "special knowledge" who does things which don't seem to make sense on the surface, but are then justified according to later explanation. One such action is to murder a youth for no apparent reason (74). However, the wise man later explains that it was feared that the boy would "grieve" his parents by "disobedience and ingratitude." He was killed so that Allah could provide them a 'better' son.

Quran (21:44) - "We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them; See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win?"

Quran (25:52) - "Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness..." "Strive against" is Jihad - obviously not in the personal context. It's also significant to point out that this is a Meccan verse.

Quran (33:60-62) - "If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and the alarmists in the city do not cease, We verily shall urge thee on against them, then they will be your neighbors in it but a little while. Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain with a (fierce) slaughter." This passage sanctions the slaughter (rendered "merciless" and "horrible murder" in other translations) against three groups: Hypocrites (Muslims who refuse to "fight in the way of Allah" (3:167) and hence don't act as Muslims should), those with "diseased hearts" (which include Jews and Christians 5:51-52), and "alarmists" or "agitators who include those who merely speak out against Islam, according to Muhammad's biographers. It is worth noting that the victims are to be sought out by Muslims, which is what today's terrorists do. If this passage is meant merely to apply to the city of Medina, then it is unclear why it is included in Allah's eternal word to Muslim generations.

Quran (47:3-4) - "Those who reject Allah follow vanities, while those who believe follow the truth from their lord. Thus does Allah set forth form men their lessons by similtudes. Therefore when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners," Those who reject Allah are to be subdued in battle. The verse goes on to say the only reason Allah doesn't do the dirty work himself is in order to to test the faithfulness of Muslims. Those who kill pass the test. "But if it had been Allah's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost."

Quran (47:35) - "Be not weary and faint-hearted, crying for peace, when ye should be uppermost (Shakir: "have the upper hand") for Allah is with you," This very important verse asserts that the Religion of Peace is not to grant peace to the broader society until Islamic rule has been established.

Quran (48:17) - "There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the lame, nor is there blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; and whoso turneth back, him will He punish with a painful doom." Contemporary apologists sometimes claim that Jihad means 'spiritual struggle.' Is so, then why are the blind, lame and sick exempted?

Quran (48:29) - "Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard (ruthless) against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves" Islam is not about treating everyone equally. There are two very distinct standards that are applied based on religious status.

Quran (61:4) - "Surely Allah loves those who fight in His way" Religion of Peace, indeed! This is followed by (61:9): "He it is who has sent His Messenger (Mohammed) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islam) to make it victorious over all religions even though the infidels may resist."

Quran (61:10-12) - "O ye who believe! Shall I lead you to a bargain that will save you from a grievous Penalty?- That ye believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that ye strive (your utmost) in the Cause of Allah, with your property and your persons: That will be best for you, if ye but knew! He will forgive you your sins, and admit you to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, and to beautiful mansions in Gardens of Eternity." This verse was given in battle. It uses the Arabic word, Jihad.

Quran (66:9) - "O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Hell will be their home, a hapless journey's end." The root word of "Jihad" is used again here. The context is clearly holy war, and the scope of violence is broadened to include "hypocrites" - those who call themselves Muslims but do not act as such.

Some of the verses from the Hadith

From the Hadith:

Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

Bukhari (52:256) - The Prophet... was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." In this command, Muhammad establishes that it is permissible to kill non-combatants in the process of killing a perceived enemy. This provides justification for the many Islamic terror bombings.

Bukhari (52:220) - Allah's Apostle said... 'I have been made victorious with terror'

Abu Dawud (14:2526) - The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Three things are the roots of faith: to refrain from (killing) a person who utters, "There is no god but Allah" and not to declare him unbeliever whatever sin he commits, and not to excommunicate him from Islam for his any action; and jihad will be performed continuously since the day Allah sent me as a prophet until the day the last member of my community will fight with the Dajjal (Antichrist)

Abu Dawud (14:2527) - The Prophet said: Striving in the path of Allah (jihad) is incumbent on you along with every ruler, whether he is pious or impious

Muslim (1:33) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah

Bukhari (8:387) - Allah's Apostle said, "I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah

Muslim (1:149) - "Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause..."

Muslim (20:4645) - "...He (the Messenger of Allah) did that and said: There is another act which elevates the position of a man in Paradise to a grade one hundred (higher), and the elevation between one grade and the other is equal to the height of the heaven from the earth. He (Abu Sa'id) said: What is that act? He replied: Jihad in the way of Allah! Jihad in the way of Allah!"

Muslim (20:4696) - "the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: 'One who died but did not fight in the way of Allah nor did he express any desire (or determination) for Jihid died the death of a hypocrite.'"

Muslim (19:4321-4323) - Three separate hadith in which Muhammad shrugs over the news that innocent children were killed in a raid by his men against unbelievers. His response: "They are of them (meaning the enemy)."

Tabari 7:97 The morning after the murder of Ashraf, the Prophet declared, "Kill any Jew who falls under your power." Ashraf was a poet, killed by Muhammad's men because he insulted Islam. Here, Muhammad widens the scope of his orders to kill. An innocent Jewish businessman was then slain by his Muslim partner, merely for being non-Muslim.

Tabari 9:69 "Killing Unbelievers is a small matter to us" The words of Muhammad, prophet of Islam.

Ibn Ishaq: 327 - “Allah said, ‘A prophet must slaughter before collecting captives. A slaughtered enemy is driven from the land. Muhammad, you craved the desires of this world, its goods and the ransom captives would bring. But Allah desires killing them to manifest the religion.’”

Ibn Ishaq: 990 - Lest anyone think that cutting off someone's head while screaming 'Allah Akbar!' is a modern custom, here is an account of that very practice under Muhammad, who seems to approve.

Ibn Ishaq: 992 - "Fight everyone in the way of Allah and kill those who disbelieve in Allah." Muhammad's instructions to his men prior to a military raid.

Other than the fact that Muslims haven't killed every non-Muslim under their domain, there is very little else that they can point to as proof that theirs is a peaceful, tolerant religion. Few verses in the Quran can be construed to fit the contemporary virtues of religious tolerance and universal brotherhood. Those that do are earlier "Meccan" verses that are obviously abrogated by later ones. Small wonder that Muslim apologists spend a lot of time speaking of the "risks" of trying to interpret the Quran without their "assistance."

Far from being mere history or theological construct, the violent verses of the Quran have played a key role in actual massacre and genocide. This includes the brutal slaughter of tens of millions of Hindus for five centuries beginning around 1000 AD with Mahmud of Ghazni's bloody conquest, including the massacre of those who defending their temples from destruction. Buddhism was very nearly wiped off the Indian subcontinent. Judaism and Christianity met the same fate (albeit more slowly) in areas conquered by Muslim armies, including the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe, including today's Turkey. Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of a proud Persian people is despised by Muslims and barely survives in modern Iran.

So ingrained is violence in the religion that Islam has never really stopped being at war, either with other religions or with itself.

Muhammad was a military leader, laying siege to towns, massacring the men, raping their women, enslaving their children, and taking what was once the property of others for his own. On several occasions he rejected offers of surrender from the besieged inhabitants and killed those whom he could take prisoner. He inspired his followers to battle even when they did not feel it was right to fight, promising them slaves and booty if they did and threatening them with Hell if they did not. Muhammad allowed his men to rape traumatized women captured in battle.

It is important to emphasize that Muslim armies waged aggressive campaigns, and it was the companions of Muhammad who made the most dramatic military gains in the decades following his death. The principle set in motion early on was that the civilian population of a town was to be destroyed (ie. men executed, women and children taken as slaves) if they defended themselves. Although modern Muslim apologists often claim that Islam only attacked in self-defense, this is not only an oxymoron, but it is flatly contradicted by the accounts of Muslim historians and others going back to the time of Muhammad.

Consider the example of the Qurayza Jews, who were completely wiped out only five years after Muhammad arrived in Medina. Their leader opted to stay neutral when their town was besieged by a Meccan army, sent to take revenge for Muhammad's deadly caravan raids. The tribe killed no one from either side and even surrendered peacefully to Muhammad after the Meccans had been turned back. Yet the prophet of Islam had every male member of the Qurayza beheaded, and every woman and child enslaved, even raping one of the captives himself (what Muslim apologists call same day "marriage").

Muhammad's failure to leave a clear line of succession resulted in perpetual internal war following his death. Those who knew him best first fought to keep remote tribes from leaving Islam and reverting to their preferred religion (the Ridda or 'Apostasy wars'). Then within the closer community, early Meccan converts battled later ones. Hostility developed between those immigrants who had traveled with Muhammad to Mecca and the Ansar at Medina who had helped them settle in. Finally there was a violent struggle within Muhammad's own family between his favorite wife and favorite daughter - a jagged schism that has left Shias and Sunnis at each others' throats to this day.

The strangest and most untrue thing that can be said about Islam is that it is a Religion of Peace. If every standard by which the West is judged and condemned (slavery, imperialism, intolerance, women's rights, sexuality, warfare...) were applied equally to Islam, the verdict would be absolutely devastating. Islam never gives up what it conquers, be it religion, culture, language or life. Neither does it make apologies or any real effort at moral progress. It is the least open to dialogue and the most self-absorbed. It is convinced of its own perfection, yet brutally shuns self-examination and represses criticism.

This is what makes the verses of violence so dangerous. They are given the weight of divine command. While Muslim terrorists take them as literally as anything else in the Quran, and understand that Islam is incomplete without Jihad, moderates offer little to contradict them - outside of opinion. Indeed, what do they have? Speaking of peace and love may win over the ignorant, but when every twelfth verse of Islam's holiest book either speaks to Allah's hatred for non-Muslims or calls for their death, forced conversion, or subjugation, it's little wonder that sympathy for terrorism runs as deeply as it does in the broader community - even if most Muslims personally prefer not to interpret their religion in this way.

(But of course, taqqiya, lying to the non muslim is a holy work to disguise islams teachings and agenda - the muslims that accept islam is evil are leaving islam in droves, even under the calls for their death that islam commands, (not the ones that like evil of course).
 
 
 
I was more referring to the fact there will always be someone that will not accept the idea and therefore will create change. If change happens then the "rule" ends.

Funny how you mention the Quran. Although you may believe that it is the Quran causes all the problems in the world, it isnt, people cause problems by wanting everyone to see what they seea and doing it in any way that they can.

 

Around 97% of world terrorism is by muslims following the teaching and examples of muhammad, quran and hadiths.
