 
 
No evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing in Kosovo
 
 
How many people cheered when NATO bombed Serbia  

Just because we had our heads filled with war proporganda months before the bombs started!

Are we going to fall for the same lies about attacking Iran  

 
Rollie Keith, the retired Canadian military officer who served as a OSCE * Kosovo Verification Mission observer in Kosovo in the 1990s said he never saw any evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing involving Slobodan Milosevic and Serbian forces in Kosovo and Metohija.

The 69-year-old Keith, who is a historian, met former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic while he served as a OSCE observer in Kosovo in the 1990s. And he testified as a defense witness at Milosevic's trial at The Hague late 2004.

Why did you agreed to testify at the trial?

It was very clear to me that what took place in Yugoslavia in 1999 with the NATO invention along with Canada was not justified by the events on the ground that I was witnessing. As I wrote at that time, I said this was a frailer of diplomacy and it was wrong to make war on a nation that was struggling to deal with the insurrection and the problems that were inherited as ethnic diversity. As consequence of that I wrote and spoke out six years ago against the NATO war. When I was asked to participate in the defense of Mr. Milosevic I agreed to that. I have never stated privately nor publicly on the guilt nor innocence on the charges brought about against former president Milosevic. But, I did agree to testify on behalf of truth and justices, because I did not see that the precepts of the trial based on the charges of genocide and ethnic cleansing in order constituent parts of Yugoslavia and Kosovo were correct.

Well a Canadian military officer who served as a OSCE * Kosovo Verification Mission observer in Kosovo in the 1990s is a reliable source  

The web site only posted the article and did not write it  

Bringing up other stories from that site is not a valid point and you are just trying (badly) to pick a fight.
 
 
Well for that Canadian military officer who doesn't think that anything happened there, there are 10 military officers who do think something happened and do think intervention was necessary.

I don't trust that source on US and Nato foreign policy any more than I trust Christian-fundamentalist websites about evolution. The source you've cited is clearly run by crackpot leftists who think that the USA is run by an evil monkey, whose only goal in Iraq was to get his hands on oil.

Don't you understand war proporganda?

Everyone does it and the masses just fall for it  

Can you recall the Iraqi women who said she say Iraqi soldiers throwing babies out of incubators in Kuwait? She lied and she is the daughter of the Kuwaitie ambassador to USA   She was trained by CIA on acting etc

I did a thread on this subject:

 http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=186877 

The point I am making is that they ant a war with Iran and they willlie and kill to go it by all means- have the sense not to fall for it!

If Iran closed down all their nuclear sites they would just lie about something else, like human rights or terrorists training camps in Iran etc

This war with Iran will have huge consequences for everyone here in West too.
 
 
Don't you understand anti-American propanganda?

EVERYONE FALLS FOR IT!
 
 
I see idiocy is still not a bannable offence...
 
 
What about this?
Centre for Policy Studies
KOSOVO: LAW & DIPLOMACY
 http://www.cps.org.uk/pdf/pub/91.pdf 

Was the Campaign Lawful?
The Government, while correctly accepting that the Kosovo
bombing could not be justified if it involved a grave breach
of international law, wrongly assured the House of Commons
and the British public that it did not involve such a breach,
while refusing the Yugoslav challenge to have the point
tested before the International Court of Justice. See Chapter
One (pages 1 to 7).
Was the Campaign Necessary?
It is possible that the Kosovo problem could have been
settled by diplomacy and without the use of force. It is
certain that NATO did not make every effort to do so: at a
critical point in the discussions at Rambouillet, NATO
abandoned diplomacy in favour of a package of nonnegotiable
demands contained in a document described by
Dr Kissinger as “a terrible diplomatic document”, as a
“provocation” and as “an excuse to start bombing”. And it is
likely that, if the terms which were agreed at the end of the
campaign had been put forward at Rambouillet, then the
ethnic cleansing and the war could have been averted. See
Chapter Two (pages 8 to 15).
Was the Campaign Successful?
NATO failed in its stated objective of averting a
humanitarian disaster in Kosovo. It did not prevent the
disaster of the Albanian exodus but, on the contrary, either
caused or precipitated it. It also caused an additional
humanitarian and environmental disaster throughout the
whole of Yugoslavia. It has not, despite praiseworthy efforts
to do so, succeeded in stopping ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. It
has only reversed the roles of persecutor and persecuted.
Furthermore, it has not solved the underlying problems in
Yugoslavia. The region will remain unstable for the
foreseeable future. See Chapter Three (pages 16 to 21).
 
 
As for the main question of the thread you may want (or may not?) have a look at the following collection of quite reliable sources:

Press Reports On False Claims Of Genocide By Serbs In Kosovo
 http://www.btinternet.com/~nlpWESSEX...falsehoods.htm 

Some citations:

"A United Nations court has ruled that Serbian troops did not carry out genocide against ethnic Albanians during Slobodan Milosevic's campaign of aggression in Kosovo from 1998 to 1999... The court, which is comprised of two international judges and one Albanian, was ruling on the case of a Serb, Miroslav Vuckovic, convicted of genocide by a district court in Mitrovica".
Kosovo assault 'was not genocide'
BBC Online, 7 September 2001

"...About 3,000 people are still missing from the 1998-99 conflict. Most are ethnic Albanians but some 500 Serbs are also missing, believed to have been killed by the rebels. Two mass graves with the bodies of Serb civilians were unearthed in Kosovo earlier this month."
Serbia to return Kosovo corpses found in mass grave
Reuters, 26 May 2005

And another couple of quotations:
"It is no exaggeration to say what is happening in Kosovo is racial genocide... Thousands murdered. One hundred thousand men missing... These atrocities cannot be seen, of course, because the Serbs will not allow journalists or TV crews to report what is happening behind Kosovo's closed borders for themselves....".
British Prime Minister Tony Blair
BBC Online, 14 May 1999

"Where are the bodies? Was the other big war of the last decade, Kosovo in 1999, triggered by bogus allegations as well? Another case of mass deception? In Iraq, it's the missing mass weapons of destruction. In Kosovo, it's the missing mass graves. In alleged ethnic cleansing exercises by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, as many as 100,000 to 200,000 civilians were said to have gone missing or been killed in Kosovo, many of them buried in mass graves. Members of a Canadian forensic team to the Serbian province have come forward to label the numbers nonsense. No mass graves, they say, and, on both the Albanian and Serb sides, only a few thousand dead. A mockery of the numbers used to justify the war..... The Kosovo story has etchings of Iraq all over it. The United States (the Democrats this time) and Britain (Tony Blair again) demonize an enemy with fraudulent accusations. They play the gullible media, Canada's included, like a violin. The latest person to debunk the genocide numbers is retired Vancouver homicide detective Brian Honeybourn, a member of the forensic team. He told The Ottawa Citizen this week that his nine-member group found mainly single graves, with a couple of exceptions being one of 20 bodies and another 11. He wonders how genocide charges against Mr. Milosevic can stand up. 'It seems as though The Hague is beginning to panic.' But having everybody in the wagon doesn't excuse what happened. If the forensic teams' stories are correct, the missing dead in Kosovo is indeed a scandal comparable to the absence of WMD in Iraq. In a five-year period, political leaders twice duped their populations into going to war."
Another Case of Mass Deception?
Globe and Mail (Canada), 2 September 2004

And there are MUCH MORE about the "genocide" in Kosovo!
So probably Dave777 was right...

PS Do not you think that it was easier to kill Milosevic than to prove his "crimes"???
 
 
You're a fool.

OK - so ONE person did not see these activities while he was there - I'm sure there were people who were in the German army during WW2 and never saw the holocaust being enacted - this does not mean it didn't happen.

There is, as I'm sure you're aware, a significant amount of evidence in the form of murdered citizens, mass graves.etc.etc.

Fair question. Few tears were shed when the allies bombed Serbia and the whole war was reported I felt in a rather biased way. I certainly don't remember reading a whole lot about Croatian and Bosnian atrocities against Serbs.
 
 
you cant argue who lives where when there are no houses left - we did them a service...made it simpler for them  
 
 
Why no outrage about NATO attacking there? And why so much over Iraq?
Oh yes, I forgot, the West is only allowed to bomb white people.

Whilst I'm pro-Iraq war, the main contention people have is not that the war itself was unjust, but that the justification for the war (ie. WMD) was found to be innaccurate (though Saddam had conventional weapons incl. Ballistic SCUDs that were prohibited by the terms of the 1991 Ceasefire). Add to that the "Dodgy Dossier" and you've got a whole-load of anti-war people.

EDIT: Has anybody else met Brian Haw, of  http://www.parliament-square.org.uk/  fame? Christ, he's a moron. He was busy telling me how Blair was worse than Hitler, last time I was in London.

I forgot the inhabitants of Hiroshima were white.

That is the most moronic thing I've ever heard on TSR. There wasn't an outrage for the same reason there wasn't one when the British flattened Dresden.

Even by your standars, that is pretty laughable.
 
 
Not really. If you could drag yourself away from acts done in a titanic World War to more modern decades, what's your explanation for the lack of protest over Kosovo and the mass of protests over Iraq (and even Afghanistan, though to a lesser extent)? Saddam was far worse than Milosevic, both for his own people and for the world in general. (And actually, it's amazing how many people today are still prospectively pissed about the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we should do a poll - more than would be pissed about Dresden, at any rate...)
 
 
WMD? A clear and present attempt at ethnic cleansing (yes... I realise Saddam was a horrific dictator, but I don't think he planned to ethnically cleanse the Kurds. Or at least, I haven't seen any evidence of it). Plus, there weren't that many protests about Afghanistan, despite the fact that post-invasion it's been right-royally messed up, due to inadequate troop numbers.

What do you mean saying "ONE PERSON"? Have you heard of any evidence of genocide in Kosovo? What mass graves?
Can you explain why the tribunal over Milosevic have been unable to bring a verdict for four years? Can't you see that the death of Milosevic was the only way out for the pro-war clique as they do not have any evidence of what they have been accusing Serbia for?

I am very sorry to see how people in the west are manipulated by propaganda that supports unfair wars. People have been lied about Serbia, about Iraq... What's next?

I have to agree. If a court cannot find someone guilty in four years then you have to wonder about the strength of the prosecution's evidence. That's a ridiculous amount of time.
 
 
The ICTR (The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda) was set-up in 1994 and it is still very busy. And I don't think anyone can try to deny that genocide etc. took place in that situation.

The trial was going to finish this summer. The fact that Milosevic was calling 1001 witnesses and using every delaying tactic in the book probably didn't help either.
 
 
Just like Saddam will. Which leads me to my not unreasonable prediction that he will die of old age in his cell before the trial is anywhere near finished.

Jonathan, where did you get that "the West is only allowed to bomb white people" b*llocks?

Iraq isn't the Hague. The Iraqi judges aren't as nice or dedicated to the letter and spirit of the law.
 
 
Maybe not, but they're not being terribly quick about the trial, not least because they keep chopping and changing, so the end result (namely a really, really long trial) will be the same. Anyway, that's my prediction and I'm sticking to it.

My prediction is that Hussein will get executed a few months after the US withdraws or will be released from prison as a grand bargain with the Sunni. Anything in between is unlikely.

What kind of tactic did the Tribunal use?
Here is an example:

Critics of the court took Clark's testimony as a prime example of the court's flaws. During Clark's cross-examination by Milošević the following exchange is found:

MILOŠEVIĆ: [Interpretation] General Clark, is it true that in an interview that you gave for The New Yorker on the 17th of November, you said that the war that you waged was technically illegal?
[Judge Richard May, presiding, cuts Milošević off and some back and forth follows between the two, in which Judge May reminds Milošević that since Milošević is cross-examining General Clark, he can only address matters regarding which the witness was asked to testify during the examination in chief by the prosecutions counsel. Since the legality of the NATO military action was not discussed during examination in chief, the rules of procedure do not permit Milošević to raise that issue during cross-examination. At the end of the exchange, Milošević asks:]
MILOŠEVIĆ: [Interpretation] So I cannot ask him anything at all about the war waged by NATO against Yugoslavia. Is that what you're saying?
JUDGE MAY: Yes.
MILOŠEVIĆ: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. May, that really is an example showing that this is truly nothing more than a farce.

A tactic of not allowing the trial to become a political circus, involving the use of information irrelevant to the trial? A murder is a murder even if the other side acted in the same manner.

And for the record, I don't think Serbia committed genocide or ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, though it did commit plenty of crimes against humanity.

Does it mean that you agree that the war was unfair and US and NATO leaders are to be taken to the Tribunal for the serious violation of the international law causing death of thousands of people?

Each country has sovereignty, which includes the right to declare war against other countries. No national leader is allowed to violate their own country's laws however, and ultimately that's what Milosevic was on trial for.

You certainly did not read KOSOVO: LAW & DIPLOMACY by Mark Littman.

Specially for you:
It is generally accepted that the use of force in the settlement of disputes
between states is absolutely prohibited except in two circumstances:
�� in self-defence, or
�� under the authority of the Security Council.

And by the way, what laws of his country did Milosevic violate? Was it the reason for the aggressors to start the war?

Can you explain why in the same day I watched Jack Straw apologise for not intervening in Kosovo earlier and the government be attacked for taking action against Iraq (a far worse threat to its own people and international stability)?
 
 
Nope, but 1) he doesn't represent The West and 2) there are white people in Iraq and non-white people in Kosovo.
 
 
look; this canadian soldier creation is welcome to state his 'observations', and he was welcome to testify at the trial. the fact is that initial ruminations on death-tolls were exaggerated, as they often are in times of conflict.

however, i refer you to

War and mortality in Kosovo, 1998–99: an epidemiological testimony
The Lancet, Volume 355, Issue 9222, 24 June 2000, Pages 2204-2209

and the following:

 
Since 1999, 4500 bodies of victims of the conflict have been recovered and approximately one-half have been identified, Mr. Baraybar said: "We are attempting to hit the target set by the SRSG of completing all new exhumations by Dec 31st, 2002. The season is drawing to a close, as we expect to be unable to exhume after the first week of December."

Mr. Baraybar said that more than 200 new individual graves remain to be exhumed, and that open investigations (some 50) could yield another 100 bodies, making the total estimated workload for this year approximately 300 bodies. These are mostly unidentified bodies from the conflict, buried in cemeteries. Next year, he said, about 1000 bodies, previously exhumed by ICTY, are to be re-exhumed to collect samples for DNA testing.

1) His comments represent the monumental difference in public reaction to the two events. Also evidenced by the lack of protest over Kosovo and the amount of protest over Iraq.
2) True, but I'm talking more about the identity of the country being targeted than the indivudals within it.

Erm... where is it written that those are the only two justifications for force? There are no statutes in International Law, where are you plucking these 'laws' from?
 
 
If there is no evidence of Kosovo genocide, then there is no evidence of the holocaust either.

I think I know international law better than you, thank you. Aggression is an unenforceable "law", and is thus no law at all. Furthermore, as long as the aggression carried out by a legitimate state entity, the leadership of that state are acting on behalf of the state and not themselves.

'No evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing in Kosovo'.

i'm not going to judge what does or does not constitute genocide or attempted genocide in an ethnically and geopolitically fractured area like the former Yugoslavia; but what say ye to the information posted above about the 4,500 bodies?
 
 
As I said before - just because one canadian soldier can find no reason that this occured, does not mean it didn't.

Mark Littman QC is a practising barrister and former Master Treasurer of the Middle Temple. He is a member of the Court of Governors of the London School of Economics. He is on the council of Index on Censorship and is a trustee of the Aids Crisis Trust. He was formerly a director of several companies in the UK and USA including the British Steel Corporation

Why not to read this  http://www.cps.org.uk/pdf/pub/91.pdf  (I posted this link yesterday in this thread).
 
 
Saying something is law doesn't make it so (despite what some of the utopian international lawyers claim). Until the major powers of the day start acting as if something is law, no one can seriously claim that it is. This is especially true for "laws" that can only be enforced by the said major powers.

The relevant law is to be found in treaties and in the practice of states.
One such treaty, of great importance, is the Charter of the United
Nations, which has been ratified by 185 of approximately 190 states. By
its own terms, it prevails over all other treaties. The following provisions
of the Charter are particularly relevant to the question of the legality of
the NATO action in respect of Kosovo :
Article 2(3)
All members “shall settle their international disputes by
peaceful means in such a manner that international peace
and security, and justice are not threatened.”
Article 2(4)
All members shall refrain in their international relations from
the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or
political independence of any state, or in any other manner
inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.
Article 53
..no enforcement action shall be taken under regional
arrangements or by regional agencies without the
authorisation of the Security Council.

As for now it is absolutely possible to accuse Mr. Bush of "sending thugs to intimidate and slaughter civilians" in Iraq.

Why did they ratify the Charter of the United Nations then? Or it is possible for the major powers to 'forget' about it from time to time?

Let's go back to the Stone Age? Force of Force?

 
The Government now claims that there is, or ought to be, a
principle that it is lawful for force to be used against another
State, without the authority of the Security Council, where this is
necessary “to avert what would otherwise be a humanitarian
disaster.” Such a principle would presumably be available not
only to NATO, but to any state, such as Russia, China or Indonesia.
There are at any one time between 30 and 40 violent conflicts
taking place in the world, in any one of which such a principle
might be invoked.

Because an idiot lawyer says something doesn't make it true. I'm amazed that in this day and age some lawyers actually think that international law can be divorced from international politics. International law can only be enforced through politics, and claiming otherwise only discredits the concept of international law even further.

As for now it is absolutely possible to accuse Mr. Bush of "sending thugs to intimidate and slaughter civilians" in Iraq.
 

Clinton and NATO are not subject to Serbian law; Milosevic is. If Clinton bombed the US, he would be tried for that.

Why did they ratify the Charter of the United Nations then? Or it is possible for the major powers to 'forget' about it from time to time?
 

Because it was the politically convenient thing to do at the time. If you read the UN Charter, you'll see that it's self-contradictory, and no one ever had the intention of fully abiding by it (and frankly, no one did).

 
Let's go back to the Stone Age? Force of Force?
 

Age of force never ended. I always find it ironic that people who are the first to defend acts of aggression by their own governments are also the first to invoke international law to attack the aggression of other governments.

Its a lot easier not to make the mistakes in the first place...that way your supposed University work would also take less time to correct. Anyway - How is Thames Valley this time of year?

Why bother signing Charters, Treaties and other 'rubbish'? Simply not to follow them?

Why wasn't Milosevic tried in Serbia then?

How would you call signing international documents when it is convenient and forgetting about them when it is not? Hypocrisy?

What "acts of aggression by their own governments " do you mean?

I will do my best to improve my spelling. Or shall we use Russian instead?
 
 
Please don't. It would take me over twice as long to read posts, and probably even longer to reply.
 
 
Pfft - it makes little difference...Russian is just English with the R's the wrong way around after all...

Some documents are more binding than others. The UN Charter offers no sanctions for refusing to obey. Treaties usually do. It's also bad to violate treaties because it sends a signal to other countries that you can't be trusted, while no one really cares if one violates a convention (other than the utopian international lawyers of course).

 
Thanks to the USA.
 

Yep, just like force wasn't used in Transdniestria or Abkhazia.

See above.

Conventions (such as the UN Charter) are not the same as treaties. And countries sign the former because they take a hit in their prestige if they don't.

 
Why wasn't Milosevic tried in Serbia then?
 

Because weren't willing or able to try him.

Do you know Russian? You seem to be an expert!

That doesn't make any sense.   It says "do you speak close"?
 
 
yes...I'm afraid babelfish isn't the best for translating...well - anything accurately...but since it says yours translates as:

My of sneakers is clever you

I wouldn't worry too much....

In Moldova we stopped the war. In Georgia (Do you mean our troops in Abkhazia and S.Osetya?) are their according to the international agreement between all sides of the conflict.
And Russian troops never took part in Azerbaijan/Armenia conflict.

Have you bought the books I recommended?

OK, I understood that you like a real american cowboy do not care about what you signed, said or promissed, unless there is someone bigger and stronger forces you to do so.
But what brought the occupants to Yugoslavia? Their own lie?

We came there to stop the war, we didn't bomb, didn't support ethnic cleansing and never killed the leaders of the states.

What about the prestige of the USA now?
