Tell me if I understand the decision correctly.

I read all 84 pages. That is "read" not "analyzed in depth" or "researched." It
appears to be well reasoned, moderate, careful and prudent (TK will now call me
a retard or homo). There appears to be one very major different presumption that
made the difference between the majority and minority findings.

The majority ruling appears to say that judging this case by the very specific
rules given and presuming that all technical personnel testifying or performing
tests in this matter acted in good faith, they had no choice but to find that
the AAF alleged was valid, barely, under the broad and sloppy standards set by
WADA and despite the obvious problems and marginal competencies shown by LNDD.

The dissenting opinion (which I only scanned) seems based on a refusal to accept
the presumption that the lab was acting in good faith and finds against USADA
that the obvious sloppiness could cover up misconduct or permitted manipulation
of the results, which to his eyes appears to be the case.

Both positions are well supported.

Hopefully, LNDD, WADA and UCI will read the majority decision as something other
than vindication. I see it as a screaming, in their face wake up call to
promulgate stringent technical, administrative and ethical standards and meet
them. I would expect that another such trainwreck would completely destroy the
presumptions of competence and good faith that very narrowly decided this case.

I just gave the dissenting report a quick read, but I thought there
was more there there.  It said that LNDD violated WADA standards in a
manner that destroyed the evidence trail supporting the results.   The
technicians piece together data from different runs in a manner that
destroyed some raw results in the critical isotope analysis.

Hence, standards were violated and the evidence was compromised.

But heck, I'm never going to look at it closely, and emotionally I am
on Landis side.

I just hope they reform the anti-doping system big-time.

Allow me to be the first to call you a retarded homosexual for making

There's got to be some sort of corollary to Godwin's Law that kicks in
now. Game, set and match goes to anyone accused of either being retarded

Well, I really have to believe that those organizations will see the decision as a
vindication. After all, at least one of them has already essentially stated that it's
infallible. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for them to spend much, if any, time
re-examining the way things happened and their part in the process. It reminds me of
those cases where a prosecutor has gotten a conviction and when evidence strongly
suggests that conviction is in error, refuses to reopen the case - he's happy with a
conviction and doesn't really care if it's a *just* conviction. Nifong bastards...

Dumbasses,

Hope away.  Way back when during the Clarence Thomas
confirmation hearings, when it wasn't clear what kind of
judge he'd turn out to be, I was listening to a call-in show on
WBAI New York radio (ultra-liberal) and a crotchety guy called
in and said, "Hope and a token will get you on the subway."

Arbitrators are not judges.  They also do not run LNDD or WADA
or USADA.  There is no institutional memory in arbitration
panels, and there is no principle of building up a history of
opinions and precedents, as there is in the judicial system.
The next time somebody gets busted, even if the athlete can
afford a phalanx of lawyers and take it to arbitration, if it's in the
US the athlete can pick Chris Campbell, but the other two
arbitrators can be people that have no memory of the previous
case.  Nor, I think, are they allowed to consider evidence
outside that presented.  It's not like a district court where
the judge can admonish the DA and say he better show up with
a less sloppy case next time.

The fact that they nailed the guy with sloppy procedures does
not mean they have an incentive to clean up and "play true."
If Travis Tygart issues a statement about how justice was
served, but they learned a lesson and promise not to fuck up next
time, I'll eat my La Vie Claire cap.  And feed my Clenbuterol to
my dog.  And I don't even _have_ a dog.

I don't believe that your statement is correct.  It was published that the
arbitrators had their own experts to help them understand all of the
information presented.

That confirms my point that the panel can consult outside resources and get
information that was never presented during the hearing.

I suspect that the outside resources are more like "Special Masters" in
law, where their purpose is to interpret the science in the evidence for
the arbitrators.

In other words, the outside experts don't really get info not presented
in the hearing, they get an expert explanation of what they heard.

Having only 3 arbitrators makes for a total crap shoot. A 2 to 1
decision in either direction is a long way from being statistically
significant; in fact, none of the decision splits are statistically
significant. IOW, any decison is not indicative of the majority decison
of a larger population of informed and impartial jurors.

Landis needed a witness to the alleged lab malpractice, a prior
wrongful act by the lab techs or possibly any lab tech in the employ
of the corp lab structure if the corp lab structure knew of the
wrongful act.
Landis' attorneys appear to have approached this threshold with
general evidence yet failed to provide solid examples or witnessed
examples that is most of what Landis' defense offered as evidence was
conjecture and inference not evidence.

In dealing against the glory of France and the war against drugs, you
tilt at windmills for the opposition is always right a priori no
matter how visibly wrong or guilty they are.

If the lab tech or lab was guilty of wrongful acts before Landis then
due to the unassailable force of France or the war against drugs and
their position in protecting the public, that would not be an
organization's fault in supporting wrongful acts but only the
wrongfully acting individuals involved.

If General Cement knowingly hired people guilty of wrongful acts who
then mixed salt into the cement which later fell on and crushed
several helpless young children, then General Cement is guilty. That's
normal law unless GC is mob owned or by the Gov's bro-in-law or their
children.

But the glory of France and the war on drugs?
