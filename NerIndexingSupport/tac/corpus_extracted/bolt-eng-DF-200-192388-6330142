Hello
I'm IB student from Bosnia and Herzegovina. My school was founded 13 months ago, and I'm member of first generation. My opinion is that IB is amazing, because it gives us opportunity to study wherever we want. In my country it was really difficult to study in USA, or in England... We could study only in Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, Austria and maybe Italy. Now, there are just 10 of us who are attending 2nd year of IB Diploma Programme in Banjaluka and I think that for us, studying wherever we want won't be so difficult.

Whitesnake is a name that should become one that we all recognize.
 
 
yes, mostly because of their great work and that they are important part of rock history. in my town, they are very famous in the rock societies. they came in belgrade at 30.7.2006. and david coverdale was amazing. even the persons who don't appreciate whitesnake, speaks about dc with vast amount of respect.
