In mid-October, when fresh-faced girls
in starched uniforms skipped through the gates of the College
Classique Feminin to start the first post-earthquake school year,
their desire to seek sanctuary inside was palpable.

Dashing off a street clogged with vendors hawking car mats and
phone chargers, they reconnected with hugs and squeals. They
cheered the absence of the stifling tents in which they studied
last spring. And they all but embraced an administrator's warning
that strict discipline would be reinstated after a lax period when
"we all were traumatized."

Still, nothing felt normal. The school's door bore a frightening
scarlet stamp, slapped there by government engineers who consider
it unsafe. The semi-collapsed central building loomed menacingly
over eight portable classrooms that clearly would not fit 13
grades. And the all-girl student body had dwindled to almost half
its pre-disaster enrollment.

When the opening bell rang, the students, from first graders in
hair ribbons to seniors in lip gloss, formed neat lines in the
dusty courtyard. Then Chantal Kenol, a director, raised a bullhorn.

"We're postponing the start of classes until next week," she
announced, explaining more repairs were needed and acknowledging
this was "not good news." Freezing briefly, the students erupted
in moans. One voice rang out: "No, not good news! Not at all, not
at all!"

A new plan for reforming Haiti's weak educational system
envisions a publicly funded network of privately managed schools,
similar to what has developed in New Orleans after Hurricane
Katrina. It calls for subsidies to and accreditation of the
nonpublic schools that educate some 82 percent of Haitian students.

But, like the College Classique Feminin (known as CCF), many
independent schools are in danger of collapsing financially before
such a public-private partnership can be realized.

Forty-six years after its founding, CCF, a once-elite school
catering to lower-middle-class girls who aspire to be the doctors,
engineers and teachers of Haiti's future, is fighting for its life.
So are many other battered institutions, from hospitals to
universities, during this limbo period before reconstructions
begins.

"You have to be really determined right now," said Marie Alice
Craft, another CCF director. "If you're not, the whole thing will
fall apart, and we can't allow that to happen. The adults are
exhausted, but these kids deserve a future. We can't let CCF fail,
just like we can't let Haiti fail."
