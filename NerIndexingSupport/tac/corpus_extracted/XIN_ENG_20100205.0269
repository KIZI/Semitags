Uganda's national football team coach Bobby Williamson has advised Brian Umony
to get another club that will guarantee him more competitive football ahead of
the 2012 Orange African Nations Cup qualifiers, local media reported on Friday.

The Scottish coach's remarks came after the Ugandan footballer was ignored in
SuperSport United's goalless draw against Orlando Pirates in the South Africa
Premier League on Wednesday.

Although Umony vowed to continue fighting for a starting place in the star-
studded SuperSport side, Williamson has asked the forward to find a club that
will enable him have more playing time before the qualifiers start in September.

"He (Umony) needs to start playing. It does not matter where as long as that
guarantees him competitive football," Williamson was quoted by the state-owned
New Vision daily as saying.

"It's important that he plays, a loan to another club could also be a good
possibility," added the coach.

Umony has only had four starts and several substitute appearances at the club.

"I want him fit because he will be a huge factor during the qualifiers," added
Williamson.

When Umony joined SuperSport United last year, Williamson was convinced the
striker would be an "instant hit" in the South Africa Premier League.

Williamson had worked with the former KCC FC marksman before and knew if
presented with the opportunity, he could compete for the top scorers' boot.
