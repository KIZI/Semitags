I'm rooting for Brett Fa-ver-ah  
 
 
Vikings will win.
 
 
It ain't over yet. It should be, but it isn't. Cowboys D needs to score. The O can't seem to.
 
 
Cowboys will take another one.
 
 
 
Vikings will win.

 

 
 
 
If this were a fight, they'd stop it. Ouch.
 
 
I just turned it off. I think the cowgirls are playing today. Pitiful!
 
 
What's with running up the score? I'd like to see Favre on the field just onc more time. Then on his ass.
 
 
How bout them cowboys?

They decided not to play football today.
 
 
Whiney Cowboys...you don't like that last touchdown.....STOP IT!

Look on Jerry Jones' face.......priceless.      
 
 
I would have liked for the Cowboys to have handed the ball back over to Brett on that last series, then offer a bonus to any defender who could have taken his head off.

I predict I didn't watch the game.

Haha,

I have long disliked Favre's smile. Many a time I have said that I wished someone would wipe that F'ing smile off his face, but since I don't like Jerry Jones or his team, I'm pretty glad to see him smiling today.

Sorry Dan and Ollie, but I am thrilled to death to have the Cowboys headed home for the year. It almost makes for a perfect season.

Vikes kick ass.....Cowgirls snivel.

 Dallas Cowboys' Keith Brooking: Minnesota Vikings late score classless - ESPN 

Speaking of wiping smirks off of faces, little makes me happier than putting the bitch slap on Jerry Jones, the 2nd biggest jackass (Al Davis is still #1) in the NFL.

Was cool listening to the game while hanging hundreds of feet in the air.  

P.S....Drew Pearson STILL pushed off.

Bit of an overstatement, I'd say. The usual, Tony Romo choke act in the playoffs (as if we didn't ALL know it was going to happen) cost the team the game.

Incorrect on Jackasses. Art Modell is #1. Jones #2. Davis #3.
 
 
I think they scored that last touchdown to make a statement to everyone, not just the Cowboys. All week, all I heard was how great the Cowboys were and how they were going to go to Minnesota and beat them down, how the Cowboys were the hottest team in football, how Favre was going to be under siege all day, and Romo was the greatest thing since sliced bread, blah blah blah. The Vikings are a very good football team and they felt that they were getting dissed. That was a statement and a big giant F-U to all the pundits and teams out there.
 
 
Actually farve is just a douche.
 
 
Irregardless, this is the playoffs and anything can happen.

Forgotten the Oilers vs. Bills in '92?

And the Jerry Jones pouty face was still fabulous!

I'm of two minds on that.

You can argue that its disrespectful because they're rubbing their noses in it. On the other hand, you can argue its actually very respectful because you are saying to the other team that you have the talent to come back, even if there is little time left.
 
 
The Cowboys ran their mouths.

That is what you get, humiliated, when you do that.
