Cambodia on Saturday welcomed the fund assistance of Belgium government for its
landmine clearance.

The Federal Government of Belgium announced on Friday to provide 550,360 euros
to UK-based Mines Advisory Group (MAG) that has undertaken landmine clearance in
Cambodia since 1992, to fund landmine clearance in Battambang and Pailin
Provinces in North Western Cambodia for a period of two years.

Leng Sochea, spokesman of Cambodia Mine Action Group (CMAG), on Saturday
welcomed the aid and said such assistance helps the deminers to clear more
farmland for the poor in the countryside where 85 percent of the country's
population lived.

He said although the money will go to MAG not CMAG, but it is another plus for
Cambodia. "This is a small aid but means a big contribution in term of clearing
landmines in our country because MAG works closely with the local authorities,"
he said.

"MAG goes to demine where farmers want them to do so, this will help us to
reduce poverty," he said.

There are three demining agencies in Cambodia including CMAG, Hallo Trust and
MAG. Last 17 years, the three demining agencies have removed more than 800,000
anti-personal landmines, more than one million UXO devices and also 20,000 anti-
tanks mines, according to Leng Sochea.

Cambodia has less than four million landmines are still scattering around in the
country. "If we could receive 330 million U.S. dollars per year from donor, we
could clear them all by the end of 2019," he said.

Cambodia continues to have one of the highest landmine casualty rates in the
world, as a result of heavy mine laid over almost three decades of conflict.

Belgium has long taken an interest in dealing with landmines and other ordnance,
becoming the first country to ban anti- personnel landmines in 1995 and also the
first country to ban cluster munitions in 2006.

According to Belgian Ambassador in Bangkok, Rudi Veestraeten, " By funding
landmine and UXO clearance activities in Cambodia, Belgium wishes to re-affirm
that it is committed to promoting and achieving a world free of landmines and
cluster munitions."
