Hey all,

Just wondering if anybody else has heard from Galway, and knows
anymore about the funding situation.

They have offered me a place that is conditional on confirmation from
the HSE re: funding.
I phoned them and they said it would take a week or more to know about
the funding, but I am kinda worried that it may take much longer- i
wonder are they still securing the funding or just confirming it...so
currently in limbo status! Anybody know any more???

Cheers,
El
