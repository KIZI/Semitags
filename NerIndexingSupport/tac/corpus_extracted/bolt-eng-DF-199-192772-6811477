I don't expect so, but is anyone aware of any reasoning, logic or science about God or God's purpose? Actually, is there anything in religion (preferably Christianity) about God's purpose or purpose for humans?
Not too complicated please. I am a simple guy.
 
 
@Scattered,

Sure! There is a great deal of reasoning and logic about God, even his purpose. However, I would imagine that there cannot be science about God (unless you say all science is about God).
For considerations on God, from a Christian perspective, try the classics - Aquinas and Anselm.

You might call Aquinas "complicated", perhaps even Anselm, but I recommend them either way. Reading them certainly will not do any harm.
 
 
@Scattered,

Good quesiton... I've heard lot's of purposes that people think God has for man: For his own glory, to demonstrate his love to, to show that a free will (human) can love God, to have relationship with Him... Those are a few that I've heard before from a Christian perspective. All of those have some sort of reasoning behind them, though I'm not sure I'd call it science...

Fankly, I think it's a tough topic from a number of directions... And possibly one that can't be fully understood while we are still going through the experience. But I would assume that His purpose for humans during their natural lifetime would revolve around Jesus' two greatest commadments: Love the Lord, and Love everyone else.

While we are sugesting good books on the topic, I found (the first half anyway) of CS Lewis's THE PROBLEM OF PAIN to be very thought provoking...
 
 
@Scattered,

Scattered
this for me is a work in progress so the clarity i am atempting may not be there.

Reason and Knowledge, or could it be the knowledge of the Reason that is needed. If we seek the knowledge for our own reason, rather than the Reason, surly we would find nothing but ourselves. So if the reason for all that is knowable how shall that be? Yes there are many out there that can give us very challenging synopsis. But no matter how many ways one can fold a flat piece of paper, it is still a flat piece of paper. To what good is this if one is trying to prove a flat piece of paper is a flat piece of paper. Tho it is good to be as skilled as one can possibly be, but showing how many ways one can fold a piece of paper proves skill, not that the paper is paper and is flat. This is not to say guys like C.S.Lewis, and others, don't know what they are talking about. It is more like they serve those in need of the presentation that they are capable of providing.

Members of the science and religious community especially christian have a long history of animosity toward one another do to misunderstandings on one part or both. If the Reason for all things is the reason for all things then the reason should be the same on both parts. But I believe the science community does not desire the responsibility of proving the Reason rather they seek how things are and work so that man may use the knowledge of how things work and are for what ever purposes that the powers in the world may be to use. I believe that it is the general public that is under the impression that science is the answer to all things known, that miss leads them in to thinking that science must know all things.

This may be an over simplification :
science it seems always finds something smaller and discovers that it is made up of something smaller, it seeks the know what is biggest but it seem that it always discovers that it is a part of something bigger.
There is a program on tv called "planet earth" excellent photography, and there is a segment covering the empire penguins where the males stick it out through the winter at the south pole or near it. There it is, that which is made up of dirt and water executing a purpose for a reason. How does that knowledge and reason come in to dirt and water? And if you notice that those that were capable of not only obeying the reason but able to execute the purpose not only survived but maintained the possibility of new of the same.

The reason man is, is to know and obey his Creator, but as illustrated in Adam and Eve they fell short of that, just as if the empire penguin would make just one mistake and the purpose is lost. The Christ, Jesus is the one who did not make a mistake and is capable of not only surviving death, (the resurrection) but in Him make new of the same.
 
 
@Scattered,

You have offered nothing but dirt and water. Perhaps God gave humans (and penguins) more than that. You say that science knows no more than paper, perhaps it can know what God gave humans. No religion claims to know God's purpose for humans. What if it could be revealed by science? Wouldn't that make science a special thing. The realm of science includes reason and logic. The world seems to have been made to work that way. Is that perhaps not a message from God and about God? God shows us every day and in every way that this is a world of physical laws. Perhaps it is the preachers that have sinned by refusing to accept that truths that science has revealed.
You are incorrect about the schism between religion and science. That has only come from preachers since the time of Darwin. Before that, science fit with religion harmoniously enough to be referred to as the Book of Nature and was considered another kind of scripture that revealed God's creations. Maybe it even revealed something about God. It is too bad that the preachers felt threatened by science when perhaps it could have told them so much that is no where else.
 
 
@Scattered,

For Didymos Thomas:
Thomas Aquinus liked reason and was good at it, but he really did not have science available as a tool. There has been a lot of recent development in the understanding of science as it applies to humans, particularly in terms of life and genetics. With all that brand new knowledge, isn't it about time for a new testament of some sort. Clearly there are things we know about life that could not be conceptualized at the time of Jesus or the Bible. Do any of these new things reveal something about God? You might just be shocked.

For Neither Extreme:
The Christians insist though that we can neither increase or diminish God. If God so loves us, perhaps these things are for human benefit, not God's Perhaps a gift like his teachings. What could love for God and love for others do for us? The answer to those at least can perhaps be found in science fairly easily. What else might be found? Perhaps knowledge of God, humans and God's purpose?.... Nah..... Or maybe someone already knows. Maybe I will start a thread about that question, since I have already wondered about it.
 
 
@Scattered,

I'll be honest with you: I have not the slightest idea how science could tell us anything about God, or religion. I don't see the two in competition as they seem to deal with entirely different things.
In your response to NeitherExtreme you say that science might teach us how loving God and loving others is good for us. Why do we need science to show us this is so? Are these not evident enough in of themselves?

You said "reasoning, logic or science" so I suggested someone who used reason and logic, at least logic as it was understood in his time.
 
 
@Scattered,

Yah, that's a problem, but wouldn't it be cool if it turned out that science did. What if science suggested that God existed and was just a logical consequence of what we already know of science, perhaps genetics? Maybe it is so already. Maybe it is an attribute of genetics that is just not well known. Wouldn't that be interesting?
Those things may be evident, but what do they mean in terms of science? Science is a tool. To use it, you must think in terms of science. It's funny that humans have survived by cooperation. It is out basic survival strategy. Wouldn't you think that the best basis for a cooperative system would be to love one another? It seems that Western culture is based on Christianity, based on a strategy of loving one another and Western culture has shown great success.
As for loving God, that seems a bit more complex to put in terms of science, but it is the foundation of faith. Some people think that faith is simply an irrational belief, but it is far more than that. In terms of biology, it appears to have a genetic basis. In terms of survival it appears to have an importance because people obviously have been willing to fight to the death over it. It shows the importance of the survival strategies that we call moralities and that are what religions husband. It is a reflection of our most basic survival instincts. We know logic, reason and science, but we don't consider something to be truth unless it satisfies us emotionally, at the level of right and wrong that we judge by instinct as well as intellect. Faith is our survival instinct, but it can use intellect as well.
Funny, but it seems that faith and love, the foundations of Christianity also seem to be the foundation of very critical, very Earthly survival strategies.
If these can be translated to science, what else can be translated to science?
We are entering a time of the great knowledge of life that genetics offers us. It tells us a great deal about humanity. What if perhaps this knowledge could tell us something about God? Didn't I hear somewhere that God is life. Maybe it would be worth examining this new knowledge. Maybe some of the old stories have literal truth if only we could understand it. Is it possible it would reveal something about not just humanity, but God as well? There is supposed to be a relationship between the two. But then we might have to decide between the truth of the Book and the truth of science. What if they looked similar in both, as love and faith do? Which would you accept if there were differences, even if the differences were small? The preachers say not to, that science is a lie if it disagrees any. What if it agreed though? Would they allow their authority to be diminished? They are only human. Maybe it wouldn't be diminished because it really comes from another source that they just need to trust? Perhaps the truth.
Oh, Thomas Aquinus had reason, but very limited knowledge of life as we have. Also, Kant pointed out limitations to logic if you base it on religious teachings, which Thomas Aquinus did. It might take quite a jump to see God in science. Still, there is another, different problem that is related to both religion and reason that I wonder about sometimes. We are dependant on our learned strategies for survival. (Oh, I'm primarily a biologist) These are commonly called moralities and currrently they are based on authority and prescidence. The authority of the Church, but authority is waning fast in this skeptical age. I think we may need moral systems based on reason and understanding or they will not be used. Those can be created with knowledge and they perhaps could be based on the same foundation as religion, love and faith since those do seem to work powerfully in a very sharp, real world. That is fine, but there is more needed. It would mean that God uses science. Could that be believable? Maybe more so than magic. Maybe it is time that magic will have to pass, vanquished by the emerging power of science. Still, just how would science find God? You've got to do that first. C.D. Darlington talked of the Three Forbidden Questions in Science. I suspect that God would end up being the Fourth. Then again, I solved the Third one... Maybe it is time for a new thread.
 
 
@Scattered,

Maybe not time for a new thread. This one is a bit whacked, but it amused me to write it.
.
I think I'm like a lot of people. I know and I feel that the world is in trouble. It's not just global warming or economic whiplash. It's not just humans, nature is under siege, but it does seem to be the caused by humans. It's seen in racism, religious conflict and the cultural divide. It's seen in paralyzed politics and economics of the moment. The level and intensity of celebrity fascination is downright scary. It's hard to make sense of values and the secular verses sacred conflict we see in the technological world is comparable to the conflict between Islam and the West. That's just the mainstream conflict without looking at the extremes of morality and politics that want not just acceptance, but ascendancy.
They don't talk about those tests they did in the 70's where they put too many rats in a cage and they all went insane. It would seem all too familiar to us. The only hope is that somehow we could all work together. That is the only way we could possibly solve the massive problems we already face let alone achieve some thing more. But how could that happen? Perhaps facing the global calamity of global warming? It doesn't necessarily seem like even that will be enough. Besides, wouldn't it be better if we all pulled together not because of a common disaster, but to achieve some goal so grand that we all could agree and value it enough to work together?
We need someone or something to pull us together or a leader to guide us. We don't need another sport star, starlet or musician. We don't even need a great artist or scientist. We need a moral leader. One whose vision can validate and clearly express the positive values of humanity that are universal. They will have to also be a scientist because that is where so many problems and solutions lie. They will have to understand genetics, because we learn every day that they are what we are made of. They will have to have the humanism of a holy man because they must feel humanity's faith and mortality. They will have to have the courage of a sergeant to stare truth in the face and the moral commitment of a dedicated preacher to tell it. They will need to reconcile race, religion and value without favor. They will need the will to bare the burden and
lead their people. They will need a vision to lead to.
If there is such a person, they must be alive now, because this is when they are most needed. Can such a person exist? Could they survive without being destroyed, because they would be so unusual that certainly there would be trials for them? How could a person like that be found? Maybe place an advertisement on the internet for a philosopher/scientist/priest/warrior. Does such a person exist and how could they be recognized. If you met them, would you accept their leadership? But then, that is not how humans work. Some more gifted individuals, gifted enough to be our leaders, are the ones that must find this person. But how and where? Something can be said about the where. They will come from a center of culture and science. An person with that knowledge and wisdom must come from a center of culture. They must stand on the shoulders of giants. They must be at the forefront of knowledge. Their humanism and wisdom will not be so localized. It may have to be found within or come from knowledge of the greatest people of all of humanity. What more will it take to create this person? What crucible will they be made in? What forge will shape them?
Sometimes at night when I lie awake in fear for humanity and in fear for the future of my young children, I ask these questions and hope... hope that this is possible. I hope that there is someone who has found a path and that there are people to protect and aid them until they can lead us, but somehow I doubt it. I hope that some day they will appear to us like a prophet of old and tell us the truth that can take us beyond our limitations and ignorance, a path to a bright tomorrow. Most of all, I hope that we will not destroy them when they try to help us.
Inquiring minds... are so easily distracted.
 
 
@Scattered,

Scattered,
A great leader is absolutely nothing without followers.
 
 
@Scattered,

Such negitivity. Absolutely nothing?
What you say simply cannot be true, because he must be a leader before he will have a single follower.
"Everything you can think of is true..." ??? I wonder of your respect for truth.
 
 
@Scattered,

Scattered, and it might be appropriate to add (brained)

It is apparent that distorting with deliberate intent is the purpose for some. Maintaining blindness to the possibility of Truth to be known, and not only that, glory in such. It is a fool that mocks the honest search for Truth, and truly it is a fool that thinks every one else is a fool.
 
 
@Scattered,

Cool. I think I've been flamed.
Say what?
If I point out an obvious weakness in someone's logic, I hardly think it distorts anything. I just disagreed. It wasn't a lot there to distort anyway.
If everything you can think of is truth, you don't have to do much of a honest search for it. I must think that seriously devalues truth. Frankly, that is something I am critical of. Truth is a rare and valuable jewel that must be separated from the trivial. Not some cheap product of anyone's imagination.
People willing to lead are as common as sand on a beach. Real leaders are as rare and valuable as real truths. I made the postulate that the world seriously needs a new leader with some broad new vision. I think it is true. Is that a problem or do you think the world is going along fine with the old values of gross materialism, celebrity, excessive exploitation, pandering to the lowest and devaluation of humans?
Where did fools enter this conversation anyway?
 
 
@Scattered,

Scattered, what do you mean by truth? It seems to me that if someone thinks of anything, that which is being thought of is true in many ways. Cows do not seem to be able to jump over the moon; in our imagination, it is true that cows jump over the moon. At least to some extent, anything that can be thought of seems to be true.
 
 
@Scattered,

Uhhhh.... Is that a useful truth?
My kids come up with things like that and it is my responsibility to make sure they don't confuse truth with thought.
I looked up truth on Wikipedia and didn't find anything corrosponding to anything like truth being equivelant to imagination... Quite the contrary in fact.
If you want to say that any random thought is truth, then please suggest another word I can use to indicate thoughts that are generally factual as opposed to imaginary.
 
 
@Scattered,

Scattered

Then since you know so much about what the Truth ought to be, then why don't you seem to know it? Or have you been hiding that from us?
 
 
@Scattered,

Wow! Thanks. You give me such credit, but alas, my knowledge is limited. I do know many things and many things I have thought of I decided were certainly not truth... Well, at least in my limited view of truth being things that reflect facts or at least reality.
The only definition of truth I use is that which satisfys both the head and the heart.
And yes, I have been hiding the truth from you. I've been wondering if anyone would be interested.
Tell you what. My version is complicated. You seem very clear on what the truth is. Could you please enlighten the rest of us?
The truth is that this here looks like silly web slanging. Truth is far more than imaginings, but you seem to want to argue about it. That is not of interest to me. I know that truth is something I worked hard to find and the little bits of it I found are far more valuable than imaginings that the cow jumped over the moon. The others on this list talked about the thoughts of people like Thomas Aquinus. I talk about the thoughts of C.D. Darlington or Michael Polanyi. If you can't tell the difference, I'm doubt that I would be interested in your truths.
 
 
@Scattered,

I didn't read all of the posts, so somebody may have said this.

Kant showed that any reasoning about God cannot be scientific, since God is beyond the reach of human intelligence.

He has a book called 'Prolegomena to any future metaphysics that should come forth as science' (I think). This book is a version of the Critique of Pure Reason written for the everyday man. I believe this title says a lot about Kant's philosophy, especially his philosophy on God.

See, there can be no 'science', as we understand it, about God because science has to do with what we can know about the world around us. We cannot know God, scientifically at least, because he is above and beyond the world around us.

Of course, this is where faith comes in. One connects the science we discover with God. We must connect it with something, why not God?

A side thought, Kant says that he must 'abolish knowledge... to make room for belief'. Most people might assume that this is only the case to believe in a "Higher Power". However, there is a lot of faith in what we call science. For example, we cannot know about the beginning of mankind, or life in general. It takes just as much faith to believe in this as it does to believe in God.
 
 
@Scattered,

Very very good! No one has brought Kant's logical problem up yet.
I think there is an easier way to express it. You have to be suspect of any reason or logic based on the premise of God or that God exists.
>Kant showed that any reasoning about God cannot be
>scientific, since God is beyond the reach of human intelligence
Who says and based on what evidence???? This statement is based on assumptions about God that Kant himself said were inherently invalid since no assumptions can be made. We have almost no data on God, so anything we say is likely to be an assumption.
We do have a couple of things to work with. If God exists, it seems that he is interested in humans. Can that help us? It suggests against the idea that God is toatally apart from this world.
If the third forbidden question in science is heredity, then the fourth would be God.
What if you could, with fairly simple reasoning, based on direct scientific principles show that God was likely to exist? That is the question I am here to find out from this forum. One corallary would be that God uses science. In terms of memes, it would mean that religion, now based on magic, might need to be based on reason. But look around you. The whole world operates on physical laws. Logic looks universal in this world. Is that perhaps a lesson? If it is not, God is deceiving us, which if God exists, does not seem likely. What if everything in religion (I'll limit the question to inherently non-fundementalist Christianity) could be made sense of in terms of reason?
I'll carry this further. Anselm of Caterbury said "Nor do I seek to understand that I may believe, but I believe that I may understand. For this too I believe, that unless I first believe, I shall not understand."...... What is needed is a proof with a good enough foundation that it does not rely on prior belief. If a scientist says that they have found magnetized particles in a bird's brain that seem to act like a compass, you need no prior belief to find that it seems true. It fits with previous knowledge and a previous way of reasoning. The same should be with God. You need to find a principle that logically leads to God where you say "ah ha, that makes sense". Ah, were we to find that! By the way, that is my jest above a few posts. What person already posesses that knowledge?
 
 
@Scattered,

If a man seeks his own wisdom for what would that be? To gratify himself? For some, seeking truth is a matter of preference to honor themselves, not God. For the Truth is and can not be changed. The Truth does not fit man. Man must come to the realization of the Truth by the source of the Truth revealing the Truth of it to man. Is there matter of facts? Yes; all the result of the Truth. Man can search high and low for facts and not know the reason. Never knowing, or the knowledge of, the source thereof, or the Truth of the Reason.

Truly if there is a Living God and He has Created, then surly He speaks:
His Word is Truth for if He speaks it, it will be. The Almighty cannot lie for if He speaks it. It will be. Through His Word is that which all may know Him and all of creation obeys Him. For the Truth is the Truth no matter what the Truth is. Whether all mankind is aware of it, or not. It is still the Truth.
The Truth always was, always is, and always will be. It always was true that parting of the sea would happen, even before time. It always is true that parting of the sea happened, and it always will be true, forever. If one had foreknowledge of the Truth about the parting of the sea, before the parting of the sea, one could "prophesy", or repeat the Truth about parting of the sea. Thus Moses knowing the Truth via the revelation of the Truth to Moses that the sea was going to part. He was able to demonstrate to the Israelites the Truth was with him when he raised his staff so that the sea would part. Just because something is manifest in matter doesn't mean it was not true before it became apparent to the world, via a witnessable event in matter. The world can be like a family man. He is the last one to know, and doesn't believe it, until he sees it himself.

The Truth need not time, to exist. For it always was true that time would exist. The Truth need not energy, to exist. The Truth need not space, to exist. The Truth need not matter, to exist. All four need the Truth in order to exist. But the souls which dwell in the earth needs these things in order to exist, and to come to know the Truth. Though all things of the earth respond to the Truth accordingly, the souls that dwell in the earth, do not. For it is only to the souls of mankind, that it is given to choose not to obey the Word of God.

All things that are, are of the Truth. For if they are, then they are true. One cannot hold all the things that are true, in one's mind. All the collective minds of mankind cannot know all that is true. But of Truth, all things are.
If you think that you would create truth by doing something so that it's true. Think again, for it always was true that you would do that thing. It always was true that you would think to do that thing. it always was true that you would read this, it always was true that you were born into the world to think and do that thing. And you had no control over that. Needless to say it goes farther back then that. The Truth is, and there are a series of events, or responses to execute that which is true, that are all also true.

No matter how you think or believe living things came about in the earth, it is true, that living things came about in the earth. Thus living things or, animated matter, if you prefer, are the result of Truth.

Thus, Truth prevails as above all. Or greater then all. For the Truth cannot be created. The Truth is the source of all we can perceive or understand. Other then lies. But it is true that a lie is a lie, and that the lie was told.
If it were to be true, that there is no truth, then that would be the truth, thus Truth exists, and it is false that Truth does not exist. That which would teach you otherwise, knows this.

If you want to say that there is no Truth in the world, that is conceivably possible, but the Truth does not need the world to know the Truth, in order for the Truth to exist. Just because something is perceived as true in the world does not necessarily make it true. Or if the world insists that something is not true, does not necessarily make it not true. In the world, lies are the order of the day. As in, "what can I say to get them to believe me", not, "this is the truth, whether you like it or not".

The Truth cannot be a lie. Thus the Truth is perfect and incorruptible. Though some try to portray it otherwise. It stands forever, no one can change it. Ether you embrace it, turn from it, or lie about it. If you embrace it, you go with it. If you do not embrace it, what you are, remains where it is. If you are seeking The Truth, you are seeking a Living God. For the Truth is God, not all of God, but God none the less. Who knows and repeats the Truth, is another issue. Don't trust me, trust The Truth, The Word of God.

It is the Will, Love, Truth, Wisdom, Mercy of the Living God to reveal Himself in Jesus the Christ, His only begotten Son, to offer mercy to all man in the flesh that the man in the flesh may be resurrected in the flesh for it is mans purpose to live in the flesh with and in God's presents. The resurrection of Christ is the flesh of the son of man in the presents and at the Right Hand of God. Intrusted by God and ordained by God in His Loving Mercy to those condemned to death by virtue of the will of the flesh.
 
 
@Scattered,

OK...... Uh, I have to say that sounds like a very religious and metaphysical description of truth, which is OK, but a bit baffling. I'm more prone to scientific, logical or rational truths. Those are more useful to me as I am exploring science and not religion. Are you sure that's remotely philosophy and not actually pure religion?
 
 
@Scattered,

 
"Everything you can think of is true..." ??? I wonder of your respect for truth.
 

It's just a song lyric, dude, get a grip.

Regarding truth,

Until someone shows me that truth is anything beyond a human convention, and objective truth is anything beyond an ideal, then all this invocation of God and metaphysics seems more like a mental game.

The harder you try to define truth, the farther away from it you get.
 
 
@Scattered,

Scatterd
I do not do for, or seek for your approval, you asked is reason enough. Any one can seem complicated by quoting and referring to writings and never need to understand. No different then one who copies and past scripture to prove they know something about what God said but yet have no understanding thereof. It seems as though you can't see past 2+2 or what is in your hand to prove that it is. What good is that, anyone can see that without your help.
*************

The Living God is the true Reason, and the true Reason is the Living God. It most assuredly can not be chaos for if that where so there would be no order or reason or reasoning nor the need for a reason or a knowledge of anything, nor the pursuit of purpose of any kind, even to eat, if it were chaos. No life could be maintain nor experienced nor would there be experience. Being born in the flesh is most certainly not sufficient for the reason for there is a need for reason and a reason even for flesh to do and be. Also man who must have reason and a reason surly can convince himself that death is the reason but there is no reason in death being the result of experience of life in the flesh, so a reason and the knowledge thereof is required even if it is not the Truth, but the Truth there of ignored or not the experience of life in the flesh requires the experience of the death of the flesh. Even those that profess there is no God still require reason and a reason for and the knowledge thereof. So there must be a reason and that reason must be God. Life is, experience is, how can that be denied?

If there is a reason for all things then all things must come to the reason for all things.
It is understood that nothing is from nothing. Even what is considered the big bang there is still a reason for the big bang, as in the result of something, or by reason of.

One can perceive with eyes open or eyes closed but it does not change the reason for. To refuse or deny the true reason would seem to be for the fear of the lose of one's own reasons.
The reason living things act, is to live, and to give life of their own life that has been given them. But mankind's reasons for their actions do not necessarily coincide with the reason for life and or the giving of life. Mankind in his own imaginations can make up his own reasons for. Surly one who starves his fellow man, and prosper by it, has reasons of his own, not the reason for life or of life.
Surly the will of life is to live and give life. And this is not necessarily the will of man.
The will of God is Life, that lasts for ever. But the will of mankind dies with him. And if one loves the will of life more than his own will, then he lives. Mankind for his own reasons, perverse and devour the life of their own and the life of his fellow man.
All things go on as a result of the reason for them, except mankind's own reasons. And the reason for all things will out last all of mankind's reasons.
There is the reason till now, and till now to the reason. And to live is the only reason for all things. For without life there is no reason. But there is life, therefore there is reason.
One must be able to separate one's own reasons from the true reason. But how does one do that without knowing the true reason. If one only knows there own reason then the true reason is not with them.
That which is based on the foundation of life, lives and gives life offered openly without reservation. But that which is based on death, not only dies but kills everything that has not the true reason to live.
Jesus lives and is the gift of life, for the Word of God is Life everlasting. And he who receives the gift of Life, shall live in Him forever.
If man acts according to his own reason, then surly it is not the reason for life.
How is one to understand good judgement in the liberties of oneself, if one only has one's own reason and not the reason for life. And for what reason other than life is there a reason. Which does not necessarily include man's reason.
Is not everything the result of Truth. Does even science prove that one can understand how something has come to be? Was not the Truth there before one came to the understanding of what the Truth is? How long was the Truth there before one came to realize it. A day, a month 10,000 years, or forever. And how long will it be the Truth?
Does one have to be religious to know the reason for Life? No. Must one become a scientist to know the reason for Life? No. Can anyone control or change the true reason for Life? No. Can anyone who breaths know the true reason for Life? Yes. Mankind can control his own reason. But mankind cannot control the true reason for Life, nor can he control the Truth, or the Way, or the Life. It is Jesus the Word of God, given in the flesh to the world so that those who hunger for Truth may have it. Those who thirst for the knowledge of God may have it and have it abundantly, no one controls that. No religion, no church, no scientist, no worshiper of other gods, no king, nation or philosophy can control the Kingdom of God which lives and gives Life, which is the reason for Life, which is the will of God.
It is the will of mankind to reject that which he cannot control. For the Will, the Word and the Spirit of God can not be controlled by the will of man, nor the words of man, nor his soul.
He who thinks to be in control of the Truth shall be burned by it.
Nether the will of mankind or the flesh can stop the reason for Life. It is the Will of the Living God the is the reason for Life. And the Way to live is His Word Jesus the Christ. Who is the revelation of His Father's Will, and is Life. For in order to live failure is not an option. But the mercy of God who provides for Life, forgives failure if one turns back from error. Is made up of earthly material and made by God but the soul is of the breath of God that can be alive in the Spirit of God, by His Word which reveals the Will of God.
Thus one can except the Will of God reveled by His Word by trusting His Word, Jesus, the One to Trust.
There is no way to defeat God the reason for Life. Man can but his trust in what ever he wants, or he can but his trust in the reason for Life.
Ether religion is what one believes, which could be anything including science. Or religion is the few that control or manipulate the many using or abusing the trust of what they believe.
Just as one could say that the vastness of the universe is like unto the mind of God but it is not the mind of God. A profit of the Living God could repeat the Word of God but is not the Word of God. In this the profit may be like unto but not.
If one lives in the flesh and not the Spirit of God. Then surly one sees or has no reason or need for a soul. When one seeks for things through the flesh and in the world and not of God. One does not value the things of God. For the things of God do not accommodate man's own reasons for Life.
To prove that one has a soul, it is up to the individual to search oneself for it. To prove that there is a Living God one has to ask Him to show one, that He may be known. To prove to prove that one knows God is that God would choose to reveal Himself through one. For no one, nor nothing, controls the Will, the Word, or the Spirit of the Living God.

****
It is the Living Justice that God justifies He who Loves Him in His Truth and by His Mercy. You can kill the flesh of a man who Loves the Living God in His Truth and By His Mercy, but you can not kill that which the Living God gives Him, Life, Life eternal in His Truth and by His Mercy.
 
 
@Scattered,

Holy cats dude. You are really sincerely into religion, which is fine, but it doesn't offer the truths I seek. As far as I ahve been able to find, there is nothing in the scriptures about ecology or genetics. There is stuff about survival strategies, specifically the teachings of Jesus, but again there is a lot missing for the problems of today.
At the same time, part of this started from a discussion with a religious person where I postulated that in religious terms we need a new scripture to deal with the new things in the world. So I see no reason that the truths I am wondering about couldn't be inspired by God. All things considered from my point of view, they well may be. If God wants to teach humans new truths, who am I or you to say he can't?
 
 
@Scattered,

 
This statement is based on assumptions about God that Kant himself said were inherently invalid since no assumptions can be made
 

I think Kant said that atheistic arguments are invalid, my statement was by no means atheistic. I just said they are not scientific.

 
>Kant showed that any reasoning about God cannot be
>scientific, since God is beyond the reach of human intelligence
Who says and based on what evidence????
 

I say, and this is why: In order for us to have valid cognitions (thoughts that correspond with reality), our sensibility and our understanding must work together, for our sensibility without the understanding is disorganized and our understanding without the sensibility is empty.

Kant's aim was to show what a priori truths we can know, and how we know that we can know them. He proved that we must have certain a priori knowledge by showing that it is necessary to have that a priori knowledge, for if we didn't, we wouldn't be able to experience the world. For example, if we didn't have the a priori knowledge of space and time, we could not organize the objects around us or distinguish them in sequential order.

So, how does God fit into this? We cannot experience God, and it isn't necessary that we have a priori knowledge of God, so therefore we can never know if God exists or if he doesn't exist.

I have thought about this and came to the conclusion that when we talk about 'metaphysics' we must be talking about a priori knowledge, since by definition a priori knowledge is 'above experience'. I've also thought that any knowledge of God must be metaphysical, since we cannot experience him with our 5 senses (or our sensibility), thus any knowledge about God must be a priori, and the only a priori truths we can know are those that correspond with our sensibility.

I know part of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is showing how we cannot know God, I think it is part of the TranscendentalDialectic. However, I haven't got that far yet.
 
 
@Scattered,

Hmmmm. I don't think we are in perfect communication about Kant, but that is fine.
May I respectfully critisize the rest of your commentary on a few grounds.
Perceptual studies show that the eyes and mind (careful seperating those) follow a natural sequence of distinguishing the objects looked at. The outlines are recognized. Then the shapes. Then the location. We have more than a priori knowledge, we have some genetic programming to help us along. We are designed to "organize the objects around us or distinguish them in sequential order". That is from perceptual studies. Still, that is not the point.
>>So, how does God fit into this? We cannot experience God, and it isn't
>>necessary that we have a priori knowledge of God, so therefore we can
>>never know if God exists or if he doesn't exist.
Say what? If God wants us to know he exists, we can then know.
>>I've also thought that any knowledge of God must be
>>metaphysical, since we cannot experience him with our 5 senses
Say what? Who says? Though from my research it generally seems that the strongest impression of God is emotional, which makes sense, but I am OK with emotions. I have studied them a great deal.
I'm sorry, but these look like complicated sophist type arguements that come from peoples imaginings of what God might be with little data to work with. I'm a much simpler kinda guy than that. May I paste in what I put in a prior post:
Anselm of Caterbury said "Nor do I seek to understand that I may believe, but I believe that I may understand. For this too I believe, that unless I first believe, I shall not understand."...... What is needed is a proof with a good enough foundation that it does not rely on prior belief. If a scientist says that they have found magnetized particles in a bird's brain that seem to act like a compass, you need no prior belief to find that it seems true. It fits with previous knowledge and a previous way of reasoning. The same should be with God. You need to find a principle that logically leads to God where you say "ah ha, that makes sense". Yah, it might leave you a bit stunned, but you would mostly get over it in a year or two.
So you see, I am taking this from a very simple and direct view. Now for it to be that good, it would have to cover an amazing number of issues and cover them well.... God, heaven, angels, purpose, afterlife, morals... uh.. what else did I list with this?
Don't tell me whether it can be done or not. Tell me what would be your reaction if someone said "add fact A and fact B to get God and Heaven" (fact A is rather complicated, B is simple). "The primary objections to God are that he never reveals himself and he allows evil in the world, that would be explained by fact C and fact D". Afterlife is fact B. Angels would be part of fact A as would God's purpose for humans and the key to all the rest is faith". "Oh, and by the way, none of these facts are so remarkable, they just never got put together for understandable reasons".
Sorry, not really a sophist style arguement, but most arguements in science aren't. They are much simpler. Science is to explain things. What if science could be used to explain God? I think it could. That is the way it has been in history. Scientific explanations tend to be far simpler than philosophical or metaphysical explanations.
Think of what it would imply if it worked out that way. No more need for magic. God just knows how to make it happen... Or think of it this way. (This is a convenient human model, not necessarily an opinion). Most miracles could be accomplised with good nano-technology. You might be surprised how simple it is to reach a description of God simply with current observable forces in history, science and technology. This all with the truths that have been taught through the ages intact.
 
 
@dpmartin,

 
If a man seeks his own wisdom for what would that be? To gratify himself? For some, seeking truth is a matter of preference to honor themselves, not God. For the Truth is and can not be changed. The Truth does not fit man. Man must come to the realization of the Truth by the source of the Truth revealing the Truth of it to man. Is there matter of facts? Yes; all the result of the Truth. Man can search high and low for facts and not know the reason. Never knowing, or the knowledge of, the source thereof, or the Truth of the Reason.

Truly if there is a Living God and He has Created, then surly He speaks:
His Word is Truth for if He speaks it, it will be. The Almighty cannot lie for if He speaks it. It will be. Through His Word is that which all may know Him and all of creation obeys Him. For the Truth is the Truth no matter what the Truth is. Whether all mankind is aware of it, or not. It is still the Truth.
The Truth always was, always is, and always will be. It always was true that parting of the sea would happen, even before time. It always is true that parting of the sea happened, and it always will be true, forever. If one had foreknowledge of the Truth about the parting of the sea, before the parting of the sea, one could "prophesy", or repeat the Truth about parting of the sea. Thus Moses knowing the Truth via the revelation of the Truth to Moses that the sea was going to part. He was able to demonstrate to the Israelites the Truth was with him when he raised his staff so that the sea would part. Just because something is manifest in matter doesn't mean it was not true before it became apparent to the world, via a witnessable event in matter. The world can be like a family man. He is the last one to know, and doesn't believe it, until he sees it himself.

The Truth need not time, to exist. For it always was true that time would exist. The Truth need not energy, to exist. The Truth need not space, to exist. The Truth need not matter, to exist. All four need the Truth in order to exist. But the souls which dwell in the earth needs these things in order to exist, and to come to know the Truth. Though all things of the earth respond to the Truth accordingly, the souls that dwell in the earth, do not. For it is only to the souls of mankind, that it is given to choose not to obey the Word of God.

All things that are, are of the Truth. For if they are, then they are true. One cannot hold all the things that are true, in one's mind. All the collective minds of mankind cannot know all that is true. But of Truth, all things are.
If you think that you would create truth by doing something so that it's true. Think again, for it always was true that you would do that thing. It always was true that you would think to do that thing. it always was true that you would read this, it always was true that you were born into the world to think and do that thing. And you had no control over that. Needless to say it goes farther back then that. The Truth is, and there are a series of events, or responses to execute that which is true, that are all also true.

No matter how you think or believe living things came about in the earth, it is true, that living things came about in the earth. Thus living things or, animated matter, if you prefer, are the result of Truth.

Thus, Truth prevails as above all. Or greater then all. For the Truth cannot be created. The Truth is the source of all we can perceive or understand. Other then lies. But it is true that a lie is a lie, and that the lie was told.
If it were to be true, that there is no truth, then that would be the truth, thus Truth exists, and it is false that Truth does not exist. That which would teach you otherwise, knows this.

If you want to say that there is no Truth in the world, that is conceivably possible, but the Truth does not need the world to know the Truth, in order for the Truth to exist. Just because something is perceived as true in the world does not necessarily make it true. Or if the world insists that something is not true, does not necessarily make it not true. In the world, lies are the order of the day. As in, "what can I say to get them to believe me", not, "this is the truth, whether you like it or not".

The Truth cannot be a lie. Thus the Truth is perfect and incorruptible. Though some try to portray it otherwise. It stands forever, no one can change it. Ether you embrace it, turn from it, or lie about it. If you embrace it, you go with it. If you do not embrace it, what you are, remains where it is. If you are seeking The Truth, you are seeking a Living God. For the Truth is God, not all of God, but God none the less. Who knows and repeats the Truth, is another issue. Don't trust me, trust The Truth, The Word of God.

It is the Will, Love, Truth, Wisdom, Mercy of the Living God to reveal Himself in Jesus the Christ, His only begotten Son, to offer mercy to all man in the flesh that the man in the flesh may be resurrected in the flesh for it is mans purpose to live in the flesh with and in God's presents. The resurrection of Christ is the flesh of the son of man in the presents and at the Right Hand of God. Intrusted by God and ordained by God in His Loving Mercy to those condemned to death by virtue of the will of the flesh.
 

It is tough to tell where the child begins and the blood ends, so pick up anything that cries.

Did it ever occur to you that you are a wool coat away from being the perfect victim? They say this, you say this, they say that, you say that. What does God tell you directly? People are usually not sensitive to the voice of God. They get their God second hand even when their clothes are new. So what does God tell you?

I love to brag, and in the words of Jesus, this is my reward. My wife and I know this poor woman with two children, and she has known this woman for a long time, and stuck with her through drug addiction and poverty always trying to do something for her. Her kids are pretty rotten to her and can't wait to screw up their own lives. The other night, her son showed at the door, and I have not seen this kid for a while, and he looked thin, scare crow thin, and thinking drugs I asked him: you're not bringing drugs in here are you? No. The kid ain't old enough to drive and he told me how long he'd been sober. He had a few christmas cookies, and I gave him a ride home, as he'd missed his ride at the Y. When I got him home I said: here is twenty dollars I owe your mother. When he gave his mother that twenty of which she was sorely in need she said: He doesn't owe me any money! And she thought for a moment and said: this is God. She told me this, later. And, as I say, I am taking my reward. Because if God is ever going to be real it will be because people are willing to do what God would do if he had the kindness only people can show to people in pain. I can look away. I can make people ask, and I usually do, but I cannot not know what I know about people I know. I don't have to give everything to be the hand of God. I don't have to know everything to have the mind of God. All I have to do is not deny the obvious, and when it hurts more to not give than to give, I give. Who is my brother? When I can recognize my brother I will have found God.

[quote] Hmmmm. I don't think we are in perfect communication about Kant, but that is fine. [/quote]

I misspoke, I should have said that my statement was agnostic and was not founded on knowledge of God, but on knowledge of the knowledge we can possibly have. My error.

[quote] Say what? Who says? [/quote]

Scattered, I wonder why you always ask me 'who says'. Does it have to come from a professional for it to be correct? I even went out on a limb on that comment and said it is a thought of my own. That thought was derived from analyzing what Kant has to say about a priori knowledge, metaphysics, and the limits of human knowledge.

[quote] If God wants us to know he exists, we can then know. [/quote]

Believe it or not, I agree. I think that God wrote his existence into the universe he created for us. But you must notice that I used one key word... Believe. I believe a lot about God and what he has done, but it is hard for me to verify those beliefs with universal distinction.

[quote] May I respectfully criticize the rest of your commentary on a few grounds [/quote]

I always welcome criticism, especially if it is constructive. I believe that a person has to respect what others say about their thoughts in order to be a philosopher. This stems from my background in Plato, who thought he was the wisest man because he realized that he was ignorant.

[quote] sophist type arguments that come from peoples imaginings of what God might be with little data to work with [/quote]

I think you are viewing my posts from the wrong perspective. I was not starting with what God might be, or what he is capable of. I was starting from what we can possible know. Also, sophist type arguments, that's a little insulting, and I did try to logically back up my arguments as best I could. From what I understand the sophists were not concerned with what the right answer was, in fact they didn't care, they were only concerned with proving their answer, and if I came off this way, I apologize.

Again, I will thank you for helping me understand what I wrote by criticizing it.

Additionally, I think science can help us understand a part of God, and that is his creation. But I don't think we can, with certainty, extend this to saying it is Knowledge of God.
 
 
@Scattered,

Fido: That was great. Very very good.
de Silentio: Sophist was probably not the correct term, but it just seemed like a way too complicated arguement. I'm sorry if it was taken as an insult. I do though suspect that even though Sophists were able to argue both sides of an arguement, they had their own beleifs.
Really my whole point is that when I look at the progression of thought, science and technology, there is refinement and things retain their meaning and purpose, but become simpler. Machines are made with fewer parts. A scientist comes up with some arcane theory and 40 years later someone writes a book to make it accessible to laymen. (There has been discussion that the discoverer must die before an interpretation is allowed) That sort of thing.
Discussions about God, whether from you, Thomas Aquinus, dpMartin, Anselm and many others seem so complicated. They also tend to go to the idea that nothing about God can be undestood. I simply don't believe it.
Consider the space shuttle. It is constructed of trick materials, fabricated in unimaginable ways, given vital with tons of sophisticated software. It's methodology of navigation is beyond me by miles. The details are beyond my comprehension, yet still, I can understand where the shuttle came from and what it is about. I think this is true of God as well.
I just don't like complicated reasonings and I have legitimate reasons for that. I have repeatedly demonstrated that complicated things can be described more simply. I deal with software and I hear the term "it is magic". That is a warning that there may be design flaws. Somebody came up with a complicated solution where it wasn't necessary. Apply some object design to it and the problem is simplified.
That is not the point. There are a number of things about God and in religion that I have seen, that are usually described as mysteries. Actually using very current concepts, it seems easy to provide simple explanations for those mysteries. It is not to debunk them, but to give explanations that are understandable. That is what science is for, to explain things. Better, when there is a reasonable explanation, the mystery seems for more probable than when I have to rely on faith to believe it.
I go on and on about morality. I say that we need a morality based on reason and understanding, rather than authority and prescidence. It is true for our understanding of God. I found the reason and understanding behind morality, based on genetics and related subjects, such that I could give a useful explanation. I think the same thing could be done for God. It doesn't need to be complicated. If it is complicated, it is not useful.

@Scattered,

Sorry Scattered, I forgot to add the smiley face after saying that your comment was insulting. I was not insulted, it takes quite a lot to insult me.

[quote] Scattered - Really my whole point is that when I look at the progression of thought, science and technology, there is refinement and things retain their meaning and purpose, but become simpler [/quote]

Would you agree that the understanding of things typically start out complicated, then as we learn more and understand them further they become simpler? For example, understanding why an apple falls to the Earth rather than falling up to the sky began with Newton's which is a complicated publication. Now, however, understanding why an apple falls to the ground is quite simple.

It seems to me that our understanding of things is simple because those things are generally excepted and understood. You say that you can understand where the space shuttle came from and what it is about, but this is only because you rest your simple understanding on the complicated understanding of others.

To use your example of software code, you can only make someone else's code simpler to a point, and even at this point, that code is most likely complicated. Yes, it may have started out more complicated than it is now, but believe me, it is still complicated. Personally, I have a hard time with code because of my limited mathematical experience. You, I am assuming, find code to be much simpler, since you have the knowledge and general understanding. Likewise, I am a Network Admin, and like you, when I am designing a system, I must go through complicated reasonings to get to an end product for myself or my customer. My end product is usually straight forward, and laid out pretty simple, but it rests on hours upon hours of complicated work and reasonings.

I think this can be applied to religion, at least the Christian religion, also. A lot of what Christian believe is rested on the complicated works of Augustine. For example, explaining how Jesus could have been God. Most Christians will say: "How is Jesus God? Oh, the Trinity. What is the Trinity, it is one God in his three forms, they are separate, but the same." Augustine, on the other hand, worked over many pages.

------

On a personal note, I think it is the simple aspects of God that are the most important, all of the other stuff is simply exercise. Personally, I enjoy the complicated reasoning, and spend a lot of time trying to reconcile God, my experience, and logic. I find these things have brought me closer to God, and understanding him. However, I do recognize they are everybody.

one of the facts that led to the trashing of the ptolemaic conception of the universe was the constant corrections that had to be applied to it. It is amazing how long people hang onto an outmoded explanations of human behavior like capitalism, which really produces no good, but justifies a lot of misery- long after it has done all the good it can. Not to side track anything. The truth is always more simple than what it replaces.
 
 
@Fido,

 
The truth is always more simple than what it replaces.
 

Except when it's not.

Human pathophysiology is a bit more complicated than Galen's four humors would have us believe, for example.

Science, by its nature, is reductionist. There are always new details being added. It's pretty seldom that some law or some paradigm shift comes along. At face value evolution is nice and simple, the germ theory of disease is nice and simple, DNA as the genetic element is nice and simple. But the thing is these concepts don't exist in a vacuum and they only have meaning in the context of overwhelming detail.

A difficult as they may seem on their face they are much more simple than any simple thing that does not address the problem. If you are looking for simple and non functional go back to the the four humors, and byob.
 
 
@Scattered,

I think it's a rationalization to say that a complex thing is simple because it better addresses the problem. That's a redefinition of the word simple.

It was simple and non-functional to say that stress caused heart attacks, and that you could prevent heart attacks by preventing stress.

It's now complex and extremely functional to say that circulating cholesterol in the form of oxidized LDL and VLDL, endothelial dysfunction due to diabetes, smoking, and hypertension lead to inflammatory endovascular plaques that cause heart attacks when they rupture, leading to occlusive platelet aggregation.

The latter is simple only in that it's more easily demonstrable; but it's mechanistically far more complex.

You are absolutely right that it is a rationalization. It is the most rational conclusion I have come to today. It can never get more simple than what it is. All explainations which do not explain obfuscate. I am sorry if it seems complex. You are on the cutting edge of reality, and that has got to be scary. But you know it first. And that complex terminology is the price you pay for a simple understanding. People get sick and die. There; simple, true, and hardly to the point. We do not have to propitiate any Gods. We don't have to hunt up a kid to throw on the alter. I would say the rational explaination is the best and simplest we can do; always.
 
 
@Scattered,

I guess you can look at it as if it's a "best fit line" on a graph, in which we just have data points and we're trying to guess the actual line. In those terms then it is simpler to get closer to the truth, because the variation about that line is minimized.

That said, the "rational explanation" isn't necessarily right or wrong -- it's just the best we can do based on what we know empirically. It's just all the details upon details upon details that allows us to refine the rational explanation.
 
 
@Aedes,

It seems that this post has sort of digressed, which is OK as I have found that it didn't fit here. This is a philosophy board. Reflections here come from philosophy. What I am best at is biology and what I have discovered about God and religion is from biology, though it is unprecedented enough to qualify more as philosophy than any science. It is pretty amazing stuff and it is more than one point that I have discovered. It is rather revolutionary ideas, but it also something whose time has come. So I will finish up my posts here with a thought.
May I first give some background so that if I claim something rather outrageous, but don't back it up, you will at least know where I am coming from. I am going to write what I concluded, but not how or why. I hope you will excuse me, because I am still writing on it and I have reasons not to tip my hand so to speak.... or you can skip to the last paragraph.
I started out as this big pasty looking nerd at age 15 in LA. Something happened, but I still don't for sure know what. I asked the question, "why is that person different from me".
Shortly after that, I started studying biology and in my last year of high school, had a very inspiring biology teacher. It is clear that by then I was on the path I have followed since and that I already had calculated in the factors of disease and recombination. My question had become a theoretical question of "how could humans again achieve a stable ecology". This was a nice form as it allowed me to bring to the problem the tools of science that I had been learning. Immediately, the science of biology makes it clear how dangerous it is for a specie to exist without a stable ecology, something we had not had since the time of the "hunter/gatherer" ecology. We have gone through transitional ecologies, but even agriculture seems to have a limited projected time limit due to natural soil depletion. Of course it is all dependant on population size, which doesn't look likely to stabilize either.
I thought about it some. It turns out that it is widely believed that disease is again going to become the primary natural selective effect it has historically been for humans. I saw another more esoteric problem, genetic load from recombination.
I thought about it long enough to get a degree in biology from the University of California at Santa Cruz. There I found The Evolution of Man and Society written by the British geneticist C. D. Darlington. It is brilliant, but not currently politically correct for a reason he calls the Third Forbidden Question in Science, heredity. That is so because currently studies of heredity leads to Social Darwinism which leads to racist arguments and conflicts such as WWII. If you study heredity, you will be labeled a racist and rejected from both academia and polite society. I didn't know any better and I came up with a new idea that has the opposite result. Call this my primary idea. I studied it for 25 years. I wrote about it before PCs existed. I then typed about it when they did. It would make racism meaningless and counter survival, but that was a secondary effect. My purpose and result was to come up with much of how humans could again achieve a stable ecology. Since I concluded that the solution would take behavioral adaptation as well as the genetic adaptation I had studied, I started looking at learned survival strategies, called moralities, that are an essential part of human survival. Historically, most moralities have been based on authority and precedence, but in the future will have to be based on reason and understanding or they will not adequately serve.
Then, a buddy of mine got me to look at religion. He didn't like religion. Well, I hadn't thought about it much. I was raised in a family that mostly gracefully balanced religion and science, but it had never been that important to me. Religion sounds great, but if you like the tools of science, it is hard to study. My friend got me to think about it. A bit surprisingly, based on reason and background data, for various reasons I concluded that God(s) probably existed as did at least heaven. Considering the ancient stories, perhaps angels and the rest of the supernatural genera existed as well. What was far more surprising to me though was that the reasoning was based on the genetic principles that I had been studying so long that I referred to above as my primary idea. The point is that I am a biologist, first and last.
OK, that's all I have to say for now. I'm study genetics and found some interesting stuff, but based on that I found a rather easily supportable (fact and reason based) argument that God(s) exist, heaven exists and God's purpose (something most religions don't claim to have). It is not a complicated argument, but it is not something that has been put together before. It was not my goal, but it is where my studies led.
That is where I am coming from and where I am trying to figure out where to proceed from. If heredity is the Third Forbidden in Science, I suspect that the Fourth is God.
Enjoy, Scattered
PS. This wasn't reductionism, as I just followed facts and reasons to a larger idea
 
 
@Scattered,

How does one reason from the finite to the infinite? Does it not always involve a leap of faith?

Personally I don't care. If you want to believe, then believe. If you want to; then avoid belief as much as possible. We neither need God to be good, nor, for our science to be correct. God, if there is such a thing, or nothing, does not need us -to be God. We are mutualy independent. And I look at the good book, and from Genesis on not one human being has offered to regurgitate adam's apple. According to our myth, God put us into the way of knowledge. I am not keeping my portion of that original sin by accident or ignorence. If it had been me I would have turned that tree into so many apple pies. And for a simple reason. With knowledge it is possible to endure any suffering up to death and even death. The great advantage of knowledge is not that it lets us deal death, but to surmount it, and percieve a meaning beyond death.

What if it matters that our larger existence is a shadow of God? Only there then does it matter, for all around us, in our reality, is order and regularity. We have often shown that no matter what crime we are behind that God leaves us to our own justice. We can draw no conclusions from this like: If God does not do justice we must act as God in doing justice. -We cannot say we are Gods for acting as God would if he could. I think we should conclude that we are on our own, and that we have to find our own reasons for treating our own as we should, and if we cannot do that -then, to at least make all our crimes as audacious as our first.
 
 
@Scattered,

>>How does one reason from the finite to the infinite?
How does one reason from disorder to order? Evolution.
>>Does it not always involve a leap of faith?
Knowledge and reason are an important part as well.
Rest assured that if you followed the path of science that I did, that the story would look different than the one told by religion. It is clearly recognizable as what appears to be the same story, but necessarily being based on science, it is missing the magical component of the story. My story does not start with religion, it starts with biology. As such it does not take much literally. My work led a very high probability of God(s) and heavens which looked looked similar enough to the story of Christianity that I compared them. It did not at all start with religion.
If there is Original Sin, it is that we started as animals and must become more.
Remember the purpose of the pyramids. You mention death. What if I told you that there is probably a simple way to beat death? Wasn't that the purpose of the pyramids? That is an old old drive. If I tell you a way to beat death, a practical way (which means does not endanger survival of the human race as most methods of physical immortatlity would), do you think humans will use it? Simple, we make heaven... as had been done many times before.
 
 
@Scattered,

I hope these comments do not go too far back into the topic. Reading through all of this has been interesting.

 
Uhhhh.... Is that a useful truth?
My kids come up with things like that and it is my responsibility to make sure they don't confuse truth with thought.
I looked up truth on Wikipedia and didn't find anything corrosponding to anything like truth being equivelant to imagination... Quite the contrary in fact.
If you want to say that any random thought is truth, then please suggest another word I can use to indicate thoughts that are generally factual as opposed to imaginary.
 

Well, it's true that mental states can be about cows jumping over the moon. At the same time, there is no physical state in which a cow jumps over the moon.

de Silento - You say that "here is a lot of faith in what we call science. For example, we cannot know about the beginning of mankind, or life in general. It takes just as much faith to believe in this as it does to believe in God."

The problem here is that we can investigate matters such as the beginning of mankind and life through scientific investigation. At least, scientists seem to think they can, and have, and continue to do so, presenting a great deal of supposed physical evidence and interesting theories. Is all of this research worthless?
You admit that "there can be no 'science', as we understand it, about God because science has to do with what we can know about the world around us." You go on to admit that God is essentially different from the "world around us" which science is concerned with. Obviously, then, belief in God and evidence from the world around us have very different support.
Why does science require just as much faith as God?

 
We do have a couple of things to work with. If God exists, it seems that he is interested in humans. Can that help us? It suggests against the idea that God is toatally apart from this world.
 

I would agree that no is not totally apart from us, but my particular notions of God are a different subject, I'm just curious about God's supposed interest in humans.
If we can go so far as to say God is interested in man, is there any reason to think his interest in man exceeds anything else that exists?
 
 
@Scattered,

Scattered, I've spent the last 3 years as a post-doctoral clinical fellow in Infectious Diseases at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health, and I did two years of research on inheritable determinants of human disease. Heredity is not "forbidden" in science, it's one of the most important and common subjects of study in all of science and particularly medicine.

If your idea of "heredity" is limited to the racial theories of Julius Streicher and Joseph Goebbels, then I'd strongly suggest you reexpose yourself to it.
 
 
@Scattered,

How about you ask Dr. Watson about it. He might disagree.
Heredity is still a very touchy subject, because like it or not it leads to Social Darwinism which has led to some very ugly stuff including Joseph Goebbels. Currently there is no alternative conclusion.
It is examined in medicine and elsewhere. They ignore some of the inconvenient logical conclusions. I hear that The Bell Curve is very considered in universities, but anyway you cut it the conclusions are such that the politically correct can get very rightously indignant.
A new way of looking at it that has a different conclusion from the win-lose results of Social Darwinism is required. I came up with a win win view, but that is just another part.
 
 
@Scattered,

I'm not sure how heredity leads to Social Darwinism. If you mean people will misunderstand the science and seriously adopt social Darwinism, this may very well be the case, but otherwise, I don't see the issue. I'm not very well versed on the subject, but what I do not see is social Darwinism gaining any real ground.
 
 
@Scattered,

Social Darwinism is just the concept tht societies are involved in a form of Darwinian competition. The study of heredity strenthens that concept by defining racial based social groups. Social Darwinism is seriously enough accepted. By default, it is the foundation of any race war of which there are many, including to a large extent WWII. Durfur is a great example as is most conflict in the Middle East. Social Darwinism is generally not gaining ground though there are more wars currently than is usual in the modern world, but with population pressures, global warming and other pressures, it very well could. Part of the reason it is not gaining ground is that it is a forbidden subject in academia.
I mentioned that I found a way to modify the arguement from win lose to win win.

Social darwanism has always been one excuse the rich have used to feed upon the poor. Plato, among others, seem to suggest that the wealthy are wealthy because they are worthy. This may be true of societies, that they do better as a result of some inovation, or intelligence; but within a society it is an excuse for the society destroying itself. Humanity as a rule has limited adaptation to environment by limiting the environment. Our technology allows us to adapt to environments so that we do not have to evolve to them.

In the example of WWII we can see how darwanism in the hands of crackpots can result in great misery and destruction. Even in small ways the theory was proved wrong. Among my father's generation, the best and the brightest became pilots, and they suffered much more death. Great numbers did not live to breed, or pass their intelligence. Others, smarter yet, who were engineers and physics students may have lived because they were better, and essential to war production. I do not doubt that many of these suffered more from occupational illness. I think there is some evidence to show that when societies are stressed that they are more likely to produce homosexuals and schizophrenics, which may demonstrate sort of genetic logic, but as neither is likely to pass on what ever traits they possess directly the 'benefit' if there is one is not widespread.
 
 
@Scattered,

Uh... Fido,
Your first paragraph seemed to relate to classes in a society. I didn't mention that and class warfare tends to be covered by economists, not biologists.
I think in your second paragraph you laid out a very good basic defense and support of the idea of Social Darwinism. Some of the best and brightest died, but the society survived and the opponents society perished. (of course something very unusual happened in history and we rebuilt their nations and peoples, but their culture definately perished.)
What is a more clear cut case is the war on Jews, Gypsys, Slavs and some other ethnic groups in WWII. Consider the Hutus and Tutsis. Consider the Africans and Arabs of Durfur. Think of the Christians and Muslims of Checkslovokia. That is Social Darwinism in action today. It is a current deadly affair. The reasoning is simple. I found a way to change the reasoning, but that is another story.
 
 
@Scattered,

 
How about you ask Dr. Watson about it. He might disagree.
 

How about I not ask someone who basically plagiarized his way to a Nobel Prize, and who has been reviled for his ethics within the scientific community for the last half century.

1. Heredity is not taboo by any measure. In the National Library of Medicine there are more than 1.6 million scientific articles that have the word heredity as a keyword -- and this doesn't count all the others that study heredity without using the word (as it's rather imprecise -- very few articles use the word biology either). Then you go on to acknowledge that heredity is "examined in medicine and elsewhere." Darn right it is -- there are billions of dollars of funding that go to investigate questions of heredity.

2. The "Bell Curve" is sometimes used for data sets with a normal distribution, which can be Gaussian, Poisson, or several others, and which can be confirmed by tests of normality such as skewness/kurtosis and the Shapiro-Wilk test. Bell curves are not used for data sets that are not normally distributed. It's as simple as that. If policymakers want to pick cutoffs on normally distributed data sets, like implementing policy based on x standard deviations from a normally distributed mean, that's only a statement about the policy and not about the underlying data set. A bell curve is merely a description of a set of data that has certain statistical symmetry -- there is no inherent value judgement in it.

3. Social Darwinism is not the result of heredity research. It's simply a way that modern antisemites (and others) have rationalized their policies. But racial antisemitism unambiguously existed in the 15th century, when the Inquisition in Spain became convinced that conversos (Jews who had converted to Christianity) were still racially Jewish, and were a social contaminant. The Nazis adopted the language of Darwinism, but there was little difference -- it was just a rationalization to justify purging what they deemed a social contaminant.

4. You worry that Social Darwinism is an unavoidable implication of heredity research. I beg to differ. With heredity research we are able to screen children for cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, and sickle cell anemia, thereby implementing life-saving interventions during infancy. With heredity research we can match you for a bone marrow transplant for your leukemia. This is the EXACT OPPOSITE of Social Darwinism, because we're allowing the "weak" to survive and take part in our society.
 
 
@Scattered,

The use of social value to justify superiority of one man over another has been man's own desire as far back as recorded. It has been man's nature to dominated one another like a dog pack for a larger share of the kill, and bring one in servitude to the other, using the mind set of the society, has not changed. And unfortunately, will not. One who is gifted is gifted, not superior. But that does not stop those who are gifted from using their gift to dominate his neighbor. Where as he could use the gift to help his neighbor.

It's what a society values most that it shall follow, or pursue.
Man is trained to impose his will on another, look at the game of football. A game like most sports that illustrates despite bad calls by refs or the bounce of the ball and team member mistakes you are able to over come the will of the opponent and dominate. Which is rewarded and admired by others.

To use "superior race" or scientific data and know how, or religion, or tell them what they want hear, or fear of death and suffering one can cause the other, or even a simple bunch in the face, to justify superiority to dominate the face of the planet, is nothing new at all.
************

If your looking for where science and the bible meet you might look to the first verse of Genesis.
It's seems apparent that religion and science have nothing in common other than proclamation of what is according to those who see what they believe as true for what ever reasons. Science approaches it with life is the result of existence and the bible says that existence is the result of will of eternal life.
According to the prevailing paradigm of the science community there are five basic parts, or elements, of the cosmos/existence, (all things). Time, energy, space, matter, and something that started it (now being considered the big bang). The first verse in Genesis.

In the beginning (time).
God (something that started it).
Created (energy).
The heaven (space).
And the earth (matter).

So does existence exist because of the reason for it, or does the reason exit because there is existence? Surly the reason can exist without existence but existence can not exist without the reason for it's existence. If existence had no reason then how could it exist? For existence is merely the manifestation of the reason.

There must be purpose; for life acts with purpose, which is, to live. If there where no purpose there would be no order at all. Thus an environment that could not execute life or respond to the presents of life nor act to continue living, or give life.

It seems that science says knowledge is acquired through experience and only exists in that which has learned. Believers say knowledge is given and was always there, and is revealed by the will of eternal Life which is to live and give life. So does knowledge exist because is was learned by existence? Or was knowledge always there, and can be learned by the living?
 
 
@dpmartin,

 
There must be purpose; for life acts with purpose, which is, to live. If there where no purpose there would be no order at all.
 

This is a teleological statement that might make sense to Aristotle, the 2300-year old master of all rational teleologists, but the statement is wholly and completely incompatible with science as we know it in the last 400 years since Sir Newton's feet were gravitationally attracted to our planetary mass. Aristotle believed that the heavenly bodies naturally moved in circles, it was their end to move that way. Newton showed that planets move in straight lines, but due to gravity change direction in every instant and the end effect is circular. In other words, from Newtonian mechanics on through to the present, we understand that there is no purpose (from a scientific point of view), there is only mechanism.

Living is a process, not a goal. Life is a condition, not an end. Purposes are things that we rationally project onto longitudinal processes, but purposes do not fall within the domain of scientific speculation or inquiry. We can talk about mechanisms, or function, or interactions, or roles, but we cannot talk about purpose in science. If your aim is purpose, then science isn't your tool.
 
 
@Scattered,

Aedes,
You want to invalidate Dr. Watson. It doesn't change what happened. It also makes me careful of what you use to support your arguements.
Cool enough, but the way you say it, it seems you think it started with antisemitism. I think that is a bad thing because then it makes zenophobia look like some new thing and an abbaration. You are quite right that Social Darwinism existed before somebody thought up a theory about it, but it also existed before there were cities. Tribes and clans have fought through history, worldwide. No, it's the norm and is for a rational reason including genetics. When tribes mix, there is only an advantage after the long time it takes for effective hybridization between the tribes. Most of the time, under natural conditions, it is bad for tribes to mix. The first generation hybrid is stronger, but after that the generations tend to be weaker than the parenals. Religion has been one of the primary tools for keeping tribes apart, especailly in a multi-cast society. Western society is primarily 4 tribes hybridized together starting with the tribal groups of Sumeria, but it took a long time.
What you are talking about with fighter pilots and individual medical survival is about individuals, that is the level of normal Darwinian Natural Selection. Social Darwinism is an aspect of apparent selection at the level of groups. One group lives, one group dies. Group selection is a far more complicated and debatable than individual natural selection.
.
dpmartin,
Wow!
>>There must be purpose; for life acts with purpose, which is, to live.
Now that is one I go for. That is what I base all my studies in biology on.
Reading the rest, I see some great views, but I'm not entirely which ones you most subscribe to.
...
You seem thoughtful. Question. There was once a universe and in it evolved "humans". They prospered and grew and became so advanced that they were unimaginable to us. If they created a universe, perhaps hearalded by a big bang, with the intention that it would be a good place for humans and other forms of life to develop, would that make them a God? How about if they sometimes assisted "humans" by teaching them moral lessons?
Just a scattered thought...
 
 
@Scattered,

I don't entirely invalidate Watson -- but he is one of the last people whom I would regard as a flagbearer of scientific ethics.

I certainly don't contend that it starts with anti-Semitism -- I just happened to be able to name a specific example of Social Darwinism from 15th century Spain as a counterpoint to the obvious post-Darwin anti-Semitic Social Darwinism under the Nazis.

Genetic screening operates at the level of the population -- while it will variably affect the lives of individuals, the net movement for cystic fibrosis patients is that they now mostly survive to adulthood, whereas even just a few years ago only 50% would make it until 20. Healthy women with CF can (and do) have children, and pass on that CF gene. (Men with CF are sterile). So as a population, we have more adults with previously fatal genetic illnesses. I was taking care of a 38 year old sickle cell patient last week who has a 16 year old daughter who also has sickle cell. So at the level of the population, we're making it possible for genetically ill patients to survive and take part in our society.

Anyway, my point is that genetic screening runs counter to Social Darwinism, because it validates the presence of genetically "weaker" groups (as defined by a common genetic characteristic) in our society -- and it validates the expense of resources and time to support those groups. And these are racially targeted too, because, for example, sickle cell is far more common among blacks and CF is far more common among whites -- so screening is directed accordingly.

I've mostly said my piece about life having purpose. But again I find that biologically unsound by virtue of its open teleology, which is simply not part of biology -- and teleology is specifically taught out of students in the sciences.

Life is self-sustaining. Animals preserve themselves by eating, fleeing, fighting, reproducing, etc. But that doesn't mean that living is a purpose -- it means that entrenched in behavior and biology are traits that foster self-preservation -- that need not be consistent with purpose. And lest we forget, things like mushrooms and ferns and seaweed are alive too -- i.e. nonsentient, vegetative organisms. Is their purpose to live? If so, you can just as easily say that the purpose of a dead squirrel is to be dead, or the purpose of a rock is to be a rock.
 
 
@Scattered,

Hmmmmmm.
I admit that survival is an instinct in animals.
Could it apply to plants? Their purpose is not to live, it is to survive in an evolutionary sense. Is there a difference there?
Is there a difference in the purpose of concious survival?
Interesting... In a way you seem to be saying that there cannot be a purpose to survival. Cannot survival be a purpose? (To me, survival always means in an evolutionary sense)
 
 
@Scattered,

Survival can be a purpose if you're self-consciously doing somthing with the intention of surviving.

But in an evolutionary sense survival is a result, not a purpose. Organisms survive because they are able to biologically survive under the conditions in which they live; and vice versa. And the same is true for successful reproduction.

And that's why even in conscious, "rational" beings as ourselves, we have irrational feedback processes to get us to do things that are advantageous. As a general rule adult humans don't have sex for the purpose of reproduction (or at least not only because of that) -- they have sex because of all the instinctive factors that attract them to one another and the physical pleasure of the act. In other words, the process of reproduction happens because our bodies are biologically "incentivized" to do it, not because it's our biological purpose -- and that's similarly why humans have sex even when they clearly do not want to reproduce, or even when they clearly can not reproduce. By the same token we are biologically incentivized to eat because it's uncomfortable to be hungry but satiating to be full. And we are biologically incentivized to sleep, breathe, and everything else.

Some of these are unconscious -- like our autonomic nervous system which respondes compensatorily to changes in blood pressure or blood volume or whatever. But it's the same thing -- we raise our heart rate in response to low blood pressure because there is a neurovascular reflex that stimulates it -- and the end effect, the apparent purpose, is to raise the heart rate to sustain our cardiac output -- but this happens via an unconscious reflex, not with an end effect in mind.
 
 
@Scattered,

OK, that's all cool, but
>>self-consciously doing somthing with the intention of surviving
In a way, this suggests I should ask when are we conciously doing it verses unconciously. That would lead to Maslow, self awareness and other things, racheda, racheda, racheda... So that seems to not be a problem.
I guess then it's a question of genetic programming as well. We are programmed to survive, no doubt. I call that faith in humans. We can also make it a concious matter. Evolution and demographics suggest though that it will always be selected for to operate at an instinctual level. Hmmmm. Well, I have always said that a key will be self awareness, which will be true no matter how strong ths instincts.... Then again, I have said that the moral issue is birth control, because that is where the strategy of the instinct operates. Have sex, have babies. Maybe that's it. Channel reproductive instincts to soemthing that is highly conciously controllable. So look at demographics and see what is creating babies and why. Is it concious or instinctual. It seems to be the habit of family in a context of religion. A highly adaptive religion based on survival... Well, for whatever it's worth, it seems to follow the pattern I have been developing for a long time.... Cool, I don't often get offered many thoughts or considerations worth the time to think about. Well, I guess that is why there is a philosophy BBS.
 
 
@Scattered,

Yup, I think you have it right. To have sex or not have sex is a complex decision with many variables -- and there are three big ones these days -- the relationship aspect and how sex fits into an interpersonal relationship; the reproductive aspect and how intention / desire / lack of desire to reproduce fits in; and the risk aspect with things like STDs. It leaves a lot of room for moralization when these variables come into contact with religious institutions.
 
 
@Scattered,

Aedse
But as in the example of Newton, it toke insight, and understanding to even wonder about gravity, of which the knowledge was there all the time but do to his talent was able to not only have the insight but all the other skills, and the opportunity, to express his findings to others that they may not only understand but use. He did not make the knowledge, he learned it.

"Living is a process, not a goal. Life is a condition, not an end. Purposes are things that we rationally project onto longitudinal processes, but purposes do not fall within the domain of scientific speculation or inquiry."

I am presuming you would admit that you are alive at this particular time. If your trying to show that there is no purpose. Then would you not be doing that for a purpose? To show that there is no purpose. That is not just a mechanisms, or function, or interactions, or roles. To show that there is no purpose, is that a process, or a goal, is it a condition and not an end. Is it not a goal to show there is no purpose? Would that be a purpose, to show that there is no purpose?

It amazes me how some science wiz's can pretend they do not find, nor seek purpose in there pursuits, without realizing that in essence they are saying what they do has no purpose. For if there is no purpose, then there is no purpose in what they do, or think, or say, nor in the results of their findings. No offence Aedes it just don't stand to reason that one who lives and does for the purpose of, every day, and says there is no purpose. I mean you wiggle through traffic when your late for work for the purpose of getting to work with the goal in mind of getting there on time. Science or not. Engineering is the search for and application of the known, I always thought science was the search for the unknown and the never done before.

Consider if you will that your life is the end of a series of events all most all of which took place when human hold on life was far more tenuous than today. Do you have one bit of need to honor those who made this life possible for you with some devotion to the idea of life and life itself. If you consider life as purpose, or will, -you will not be at cross natures with nature. You could tap into a tremendous flow of life energy just by knowing what it is about. And, I am not talking some metapysical or religious claptrap here.

If you think of life at some perilous crossroads, like so many salmon swiming up stream, and along comes Aedes the salmon, saying my purpose instead of the purpose, well then, at that point, there is one at least in every crowd that just don't get it, and so ends up et by a bear. You need to tune into reality, and get a hold of your past, and find out what team you are playing for, and find out whose life runs in your veins. Every man lives for his ancestors who cannot live except through him. To give life to your own people you have to give life to some one else's people. In the very act of love and survival you have compromised yourself and become the father of humanity. Our purpose is to serve life even at the price of self.

 
4. Consciousness allows us to think of purpose. Without consciousness there is no purpose. I am interacting with you consciously and self-consciously, and I have purposes (for letters to appear on the screen that correspond to my thoughts, and for them to appear on your screen for you to become aware of my thoughts, etc). But my sinoatrial node, which tells my heart how fast to beat, is not working with the purpose of doing that because it's involuntary -- it's just firing because of a self-regulating biological mechanism.

I sometimes forget that some people aren't used to casually and non-judgementally chatting about sex, shit, piss, pus, phlegm, drugs, and rashes. I promise to make it PG-13 for you next time.
 

How could you leave out old condoms and kotexes? Don't worry about offending me as I have offended myself. If I want offense all I have to do pry up the scab of memory and peek inside. I do hope you consider that approaching something like sexuality as a scientist sort of tortures the meaning of the act. Its your act. Live it like you like.

I had to ask, I've had some try to go there, no offence.

"Consciousness allows us to think of purpose. Without consciousness there is no purpose."

Or could it be consciousness is required for the awareness of purpose, or knowledge or Truth. In other words purpose, knowledge, reason, or Truth exists, or is, whether there be consciousness or not in men.

I mean as far we can tell, a rock doesn't have to be aware of, or conscious of squat to be a rock. Why are men required to be conscious? And what for, if there be no purpose, or no, absolute purpose?

As far as we can tell, a rock doesn't have conciousness. It's not that men are required to have conciousness - some do not. The thing is, most do. Having conciousness is something general to our species. Like walking upright. Having lungs.
Does there need to be another "purpose", apart from the fact that conciousness improves man's chance of survival? The survival value of conciousness is not indicative of some "purpose"; having conciousness increases man's chance of survival, thus having conciousness thrives among men.
 
 
@Fido,

 
Consider if you will that your life is the end of a series of events all most all of which took place when human hold on life was far more tenuous than today. Do you have one bit of need to honor those who made this life possible for you with some devotion to the idea of life and life itself. If you consider life as purpose, or will, -you will not be at cross natures with nature. You could tap into a tremendous flow of life energy just by knowing what it is about. And, I am not talking some metapysical or religious claptrap here.

If you think of life at some perilous crossroads, like so many salmon swiming up stream, and along comes Aedes the salmon, saying my purpose instead of the purpose, well then, at that point, there is one at least in every crowd that just don't get it, and so ends up et by a bear.

In the very act of love and survival you have compromised yourself and become the father of humanity. Our purpose is to serve life even at the price of self.
 

You can express it as poetically and wistfully as you want, but you're still nowhere near convincing me that purpose is anything other than self-defined and self-conscious. If I live for my ancestors (as I feel I do in some way), then it's my self-conscious infusion of that into my own conception of life's meaning. If I throw myself in front of a bus to save a child, it's my own prioritization and empathy that initiates the act. As for OUR purpose? Well, ask 6 billion people what the absolute purpose of life is, and you'll get 6 billion answers, so why should I accept yours?

 
I do hope you consider that approaching something like sexuality as a scientist sort of tortures the meaning of the act. Its your act. Live it like you like.
 

Unless you consider typing on this forum to be a sexual act, which speaking for myself I do not, then you might not be so quick to blur analysis and discussion with "tortured meaning". But again, in my capacity as a physician, I have to be able to talk to patients about things that are ordinarily very private and taboo in a way that makes them feel comfortable talking about the subject. In this forum, sex was a perfectly appropriate example of something we as humans do that involves everything from physiology and behavior to ideas of teleology and biological determinism, all the way up to issues of relationships and morality. So it was a great subject to bring up, and it's a shame that in your discomfort with the subject that you had to act like a child with your quasi ad hominem sarcasm at me. And as for my personal sex life, my personal act, my personal meaning, it's great and it's none of your goddamn business so leave me alone.

Do you mean stay warm, dry, eat, in reasonable safety to procreate? That's all that is necessary for survival. Animals do that without that which man has, there's not point for the rest of what man does in that perspective. Why would God give man the consciousness that man has when what other specie's have is sufficient for their survival?

In your myth is it not man that took consciousness from God without permission? No one, not even in the Bible has ever offered to give it back. Job, the best of the bunch wanted to dispute with God. Take it like a man Job. It is reality. It does not have to make sense. It does have to be dealt with.

I think the answer to the first question might be the very value of survival. Humans are capable of finding ever more efficient ways of doing those things, and they also have the capability to exceed their needs. Conciousness provides this, and gives man at least a chance to avoid some of the pitfalls of these skills.

As for God; I have no clue. How could we speculate as to God's motivation?
 
 
@Scattered,

This may be a tangent, but I think much if not ALL of philosophy, including the question of things like MEANING and PURPOSE and how universal they are, come down to the collision between us as self-conscious people versus us as things. In various ways, I think humans (even the most scientifically Mr. Spock-esque hyperrational of us) are troubled by the idea that we're things. We're unique things, but then again water is unique from lava and trees are unique from mushrooms.

So the question becomes whether purpose and meaning lie objectively within us whether we're aware or not, or is purpose something that our self-consciousness injects.
 
 
@Scattered,

Aedes

Of corse, to me, it seems evident that man is designed to know a true purpose, or meaning. The effect on our society of relying on science to know it all, in this area, I believe is hurting us grievously. My contention is, this society, or western culture is giving what is God's to Caesar.

Why shouldn't you make the same mistake as everyone else? Are you too good to be wrong?

Faith is a fair substitute for knowledge. Either it works or it don't. If life as a test does not kill you, then it confirms you in your faith. And even though it does not point to any ultimate truth, it points many away from uncertainty -which most people sense with fear, as well they should because know one knows what will kill them.
 
 
@Scattered,

Didymos Thomas

"How do you know God's motivation to give man conciousness?"

If you have consciousness, then He gave it to you. And surly we are not suppose to follow after lies, or rely on lies. Or at least it would be ill advised. Therefore there is a need for the knowledge of the Truth. But as one in the knowledge of Jesus the Christ as my Lord and Savior, to me it is apparent the man is made by the Living God, to know the Living God.
 
 
@dpmartin,

 
If you have consciousness, then He gave it to you.
 

We might say this, but obviously there is more to it. The problem of what conciousness is, for example, is not solved by saying 'without God we have no conciousness'.

 
And surly we are not suppose to follow after lies, or rely on lies. Or at least it would be ill advised. Therefore there is a need for the knowledge of the Truth.
 

All fine, but this still does not solve the problem of how you determine God's motivation for doing something, ie, give man conciousness.
For us to know God seems insufficient, as we have capabilities that push us away from God, ie sin. Therefore, just because we have something, doesn't mean we have it to know God.

 
Why shouldn't you make the same mistake as everyone else? Are you too good to be wrong?
 

No, I'm wrong all of the time. Maybe even now. Maybe in everything I've ever said. Are you seriously asking me why I should avoid mistakes in reasoning?

 
Faith is a fair substitute for knowledge.
 

How so? How can you have faith in something you have no knowledge of?
To have faith without knowledge is to have no faith, it's to have an arbitrary belief.
 
 
@dpmartin,

 
God gave man consciousness so that man may know God. But what man does with what God gives man. Man can only blame himself for.
 

Yeah, an arrangement that allows for God to create everything in the world including human consciousness, and yet somehow not be responsible himself for allowing his world to have sin, evil, faithlessness, or inconsistencies that make his inspired word seem like a magical story rather than reality. Almost makes one want to become a Kabbalist.
 
 
@Scattered,

Consciousness has been given so that we may know God. But did He not give man the power to choose ether to follow God's Word for the love of God, or man's own ways for the love of himself for himself. When it's for you it's your way and your choice, however when it's for God it's His Way and His choice.
Besides, since when does the Almighty, the Creator answer to man the created? What fool think himself wiser than God? What fool is there that thinks that God would have to apologize to man for letting man be and seek evil when man could choose Life, Truth? Especially when man could always call on the Lord. If every man soot to be like Jesus in sincerity what kind of world would it be? Therefore who is it that chooses not to? And who's fault is that?
 
 
@dpmartin,

 
When it's for you it's your way and your choice, however when it's for God it's His Way and His choice.
 

Then God did not create man. God created some parts of man, and man created the rest. Does Genesis distinguish what aspects of man were created by God and what aspects man can create for himself?

If God abdicates control over man's decisions, and any decision is made by man alone, then does that mean that God's reach and his power are not infinite? Because if there is any power that God relinquishes, then his power is not absolute.

 
Besides, since when does the Almighty, the Creator answer to man the created?
 

He doesn't. And that is the world's best justification for atheism.

You restate your assertion, but do not give any support. If you do not want to defend this particular assumption about God's motivation, or even the notion that we can know his determination (that he might have one at all), that's fine. But, if you were going to, I'd like to read what you have to say.

 
Besides, since when does the Almighty, the Creator answer to man the created?
 
No one has even suggested that he does. What has occured is that you have made a number of assertions which seem to be incoherent. If the understanding of God is incoherent, how could the understanding of God be true? To say "God is incoherent" doesn't solve the problem; it begs the question 'why?'. If God can be incoherent, what else can be incoherent?

 
What fool is there that thinks that God would have to apologize to man for letting man be and seek evil when man could choose Life, Truth?
 
The problem is that what is called evil seems to be very much a part of life.
I don't see this to be a problem, personally, as that evil seems to come from ignorance, which certainly isn't God.

 
If every man soot to be like Jesus in sincerity what kind of world would it be? Therefore who is it that chooses not to? And who's fault is that?
 
If everyone sought to be like Jesus, the world would be a better place. And, yeah, man acts freely, so it's his responsibility...

But this is exactly the problem. If God is all powerful, and all knowing, then God is more responsible than anyone else. This makes sense, it is his creation, right? But if God is most responsible, preeminantly responsible, then he must also be responsible for evil. If God is Good, him giving rise to evil, being responsible for evil, having some relation other than being opposed to evil, what have you, creates a problem: How can God, being so perfect and good, be responsible for evil, and still rightly be called perfect and good?

You argue God is not responsible for evil, men are for choosing evil. This doctrine seems entirely opposed to the notion that God is allpowerful, allknowing, and perfectly good.

@Scattered,

Greeetings, I am new to this forum and this is my first post.

Scattered, may I ask what you feeel or consider 'your' purpose on earth is? Is there not a link between your purpose and Gods's purpose?

 
I don't expect so, but is anyone aware of any reasoning, logic or science about God or God's purpose? Actually, is there anything in religion (preferably Christianity) about God's purpose or purpose for humans?
Not too complicated please. I am a simple guy.

No, if God is invisible except to prophets, mystics, and the humans who believe prophets and mystics, then THAT is all atheism needs.

If God:
1) Does not reciprocate with us because " since when does the Almighty, the Creator, answer to man the created "...

2) Does not influence whether we see him or believe in him

3) Allows us to look at the world and use our own judgement as to what we believe

4) Speaks through scripture that does not bear resemblance to the physical world

Then we're left with two choices -- we either believe or we don't -- and what on earth reason does anyone have to believe if the above are true?

 
Just because an argument, and it's conclusions, strike you as odd, does not mean they are misguided
 

Then perhaps we could make a list of other odd arguments with odd conclusions. How do you decide which is misguided and which is not?

Didymos Thomas
Does not life live and give life. Is this not the way given by the giver of Life? Shall the giver of the need to know, not provide a Way to know? He who is eternal sees eternal, we who walk in the flesh see the immediate needs of the flesh.

The road taken supplies the needs for the destiny of that road. God forbid, the road taken is a dead end. It is in Jesus that the road is forever for it is to Him that is eternal, the road of everlasting Life is. Verified by the resurrection of Jesus.

In the OT they knew not the name Jesus, but many knew. What is to be known is the Word of God. Those that knew it, knew that which is now revealed in the flesh as Jesus. The accurate revelation in the flesh of the Word and the Will of God. Jesus being of the Father has seen the Father accurately, showing us the Father in the Son. But we can only see that which is revealed to us in the Son. That which is acceptable to the Father is from the Father which is the Son. So it is through and in the Son are we acceptable being born of His Spirit in the Son.

Does the Father Love the Son? And what is the Son? His Word, the Truth the Way the Life. Therefore if one loves the Truth the Way the Life. Then one loves what the Living God Love and are in agreement with God. Thus the convenient given to man by God in the Son.

If and others have come to know the Truth, it the Word of God that they knew. It is Jesus the Christ, the Word of God that they knew for the Word of God was always with God.

No, if one chooses God's Way, then it's His Way and His choice one accepts. That is not to say that all else is not created by God.

"If God abdicates control over man's decisions, and any decision is made by man alone, then does that mean that God's reach and his power are not infinite? Because if there is any power that God relinquishes, then his power is not absolute."

Since you mentioned Genesis I will try to explain.
In the garden Adam and Eve could have refused to eat of every tree in the garden and they would not have disobeyed God's Word. And if they were getting to hungry to bear it. They could have called upon the Lord and said Lord what tree would you have us eat from, and surly the Lord would have said the tree of Life. Choose Life.

@Scattered,

Can you say the above in a way that makes sense to one who does not already have faith? I don't think it's possible. And without taking refuge in the idea of God's grace granting people faith (wasn't it Augustine who proposed that?), explain rationally why it's incumbent upon humans to discover God, and why it shouldn't be incumbent upon God to reveal himself to humans?
 
 
@Aedes,

 
No, if God is invisible except to prophets, mystics, and the humans who believe prophets and mystics, then THAT is all atheism needs.
 

Well, if we accept your premise, that God is invisible except to mystics, et al, then atheism has no case. More importantly, though, I must wonder what a mystic, et al, is. If, for some magical reason, only certain people can see God, then this is a theological problem, but not one that gives atheism any direct support. Myself, I see no reason to think that you or I, or aynone else, could not be among such a list. Then again, the notion of God as "invisible" I think misses the point.

 
Then we're left with two choices -- we either believe or we don't -- and what on earth reason does anyone have to believe if the above are true?

 

None. Then again, I reject all but 3.

Okay, but what is your point. As I've said, if you don't want to argue your points, that's fine, this can be presonal. But restating assertions doesn't help you explain your point, doesn't help the dialogue because a restated assertion isn't much of a response, and only bogs the dialogue down in the same old considerations. I'd like to see you respond to my points, but if you wont, that's fine too.

 
I did not say God did not make evil, that is your assumption. I said "letting man be and seek evil when man could choose Life, Truth"

 

My restatement of the age old problem of evil, something I explained, is not an assumption on my part. If God is all knowing, all powerful and all good, evil in reality causes a huge problem for such a conception of God.

 
You take what was said out of context, once again an assumption of meaning.
 

No, I'm not. You are taking my criticisms selectively. Remember, you've made a bunch of assumptions that seem to be incoherent? I'm trying to figure out if they are coherent, but you only provide me with restated assertions.
 
 
@Didymos Thomas,

 
Well, if we accept your premise, that God is invisible except to mystics, et al, then atheism has no case.
 

Yes it does. The atheist's case is: "You can see and speak to God, huh? Sure you can." Assume that the atheist is someone who is perfectly happy to believe in God once someone provides evidence other than personal experience or interpretation of a written text.

 
Then again, the notion of God as "invisible" I think misses the point.
 

By invisible I mean beyond verifiability to someone who doubts. God cannot be rationally accepted without faith.

 
Then again, I reject all but 3.
 

But your rejection of 1, 2, and 4 are purely faith-based positions, and the issue is that all four of those points will be important to someone who does not share your faith.

PROVE to a skeptic that God reciprocates. PROVE to a skeptic that God influences how we think. PROVE to a skeptic that the physical world is consistent with scripture, including miracles.

Can there be proof without first having belief? If not, then all of the premises that flow from faith are uniformly contingent upon belief. Which means that you're interpreting the world from an immobile belief system that will not allow itself to be disproved. And which means that anything in the world can be rejected if it is inconsistent with the belief system.

If we accept the premise "if God is invisible except to prophets, mystics, and the humans who believe prophets and mystics" then we must also accept that God is visible to some, therefore God must exist. Pretty destructive to the claim of hard atheists "there is no God."

Soft atheists on the other hand claim "there is no reason to believe that God exists", they do not say he necessarily does not exist. Even for such athiests, if God is invisible except to prophets, mystics, and the humans who believe prophets and mystics, to accept this premise will, again, force them to accept that God does indeed exist.

 
By invisible I mean beyond verifiability to someone who doubts. God cannot be rationally accepted without faith.
 

Again, I think that misses the point. Doubt is good. And of course God requires faith, but faith requires action and understanding. Understanding is the reasonability of faith. If faith lacks understanding, it is nothing more than arbitrary belief.

Okay?

 
PROVE to a skeptic that God reciprocates. PROVE to a skeptic that God influences how we think. PROVE to a skeptic that the physical world is consistent with scripture, including miracles.
 

No. No interest in doing so, even if I could. Better the skeptic reject God, to have doubt, and to systematically consider that doubt himself. If he finds God, good, if not, oh well. I'll be here to ask critical questions when he thiks he has found God, or when he boldy asserts that God cannot be (soft atheists I will not argue with, other play devil's advocate). Similarly, I have people who ask such questions of me. This discourse is important for understanding.

Your belief will be in proportion to your understanding. As for arbitrary belief, belief without understanding, who cares? Such things are never of any good.

Ok -- I don't necessarily say that blue gremlins don't exist. So they must exist then?

 
Your belief will be in proportion to your understanding.
 

Is that true generically? If I believe in a God-free world, for reasons that are as personally authentic as your own faith, and I understand that world from repeated examination of my self and my beliefs, then I have to say I have MORE understanding than most of the theists on earth who believe because they were never taught that an alternative is acceptable.

Hi Aedes!

Which means that you're interpreting the world from an immobile belief system that will not allow itself to be disproved. And which means that anything in the world can be rejected if it is inconsistent with the belief system.
 

Just wondering... can atheism be an immoble belief system that will reject anything that is not consistent with it's beliefs? If I was given some rather convincing evidence of the supernatural, I would tend to accept it- Especially if to not accept it would be the illogical choice. (Which I feel is exactly the position I'm in, and if you're interested I can give you an example to work with...) Would you?

As for the case you describe, I would agree - you have more understanding than a theists who thinks all alternatives to be unacceptable, if you think that alternatives to your view might be acceptable, and are therefore at least worth considering.

I would like to go back to something you said earlier:

 
But your rejection of 1, 2, and 4 are purely faith-based positions, and the issue is that all four of those points will be important to someone who does not share your faith.
 

That someone's understanding is incoherent, and therefore not understanding at all, is a problem for that person. 1,2 and 4, though I reject them, cause problems for people who embrace them. They should consider these problems.

Maybe it is worth noting: I do not see science and religion at all opposed. Some people have beliefs that put them opposed with science, and I cannot understand why, other than fear. Should science and religion be opposed, I agree with the Dalai Lama: when religious doctrine and science are opposed, go with science. Remember, faith without understanding is arbitrary. Science is not arbitrary, and it is understanding, understanding that is always open to revision and reconsideration. This is a very good thing, and the whole value of science.

@NeitherExtreme,

 
Just wondering... can atheism be an immoble belief system that will reject anything that is not consistent with it's beliefs?
 

Well, I'm not an atheist, so I can't speak on behalf of the group if there is one.

I think God is extremely important and central to people's world views, as it is in my family, but in my own case I neither know nor care whether God is real. That's not atheism. Do I think that God exists in some absolute physical causal primal way? No, but I don't know and the question isn't all that interesting to me individually anyway -- there are much more important and interesting issues in the world for me to attend to.

However, the word atheist just means "one who does not believe in God". It doesn't describe a system of beliefs. I think there is a lot of heterogeneity -- some who don't believe because they are hyperrationalists, and others who don't believe because they really do have some kind of belief system that requires there to be no God.

 
If I was given some rather convincing evidence of the supernatural, I would tend to accept it- Especially if to not accept it would be the illogical choice. (Which I feel is exactly the position I'm in, and if you're interested I can give you an example to work with...) Would you?
 

Of course. But does convincing evidence of the supernatural mean that the supernatural is true?... or does it mean that what was once regarded as supernatural might actually be natural after all? For example, if we found evidence of Sodom and Gomorrah's wasted ashes, and we found a pillar of salt nearby, does that make the supernatural true? Or does it mean that two ancient cities burned down and there's a pillar of salt nearby?

Well, your refering to ancient history, and that's a legitimate point that there are usually more than one way of interepreting what remains. I was refering to a little bit more "here and now"... Just to go super-hypothetical in an almost commical way: Let's say that you would be sitting in your chair and you would say out loud: "God if you exist, send a meteorite laced with gold and silver to prove it." And then one second later a meteorite laced with gold and silver comes crashing through the roof and lands at your feet. Engraved in it are the words "I exist". Would that constitute enough evidence?

I guess what I'm asking in my rediculous way is "Could there a point at which there is enough proof that you would believe that the supernatural exists?"
 
 
@Scattered,

You've heard of the experiment people have running, right, where they have an empty cage and they're asking if God will create something inside of it...

Yes, I will believe things that I witness. But the issue is not only what I've seen (the raw data of you making a prediction and then the prediction you describe occurring, in that sequence) -- it's also an issue of interpretation, right? If you pull that meteor trick with a cynic, in fact with many people, they will sooner think "Aww come on, I don't know how he did it, but he arranged for that to happen somehow."

People resist a supernatural explanation for things they witness. Kind of like going to a magic show. I've been to a handful of them and I've seen what they do, cutting people in half and making things disappear, and I haven't a bloody clue what they're doing. Nor have I found (though I haven't really looked) a natural explanation.

So this means that there are two possibilities -- either it IS magic and supernatural; or it's NOT magic, and I just don't know the explanation.

Another possibility in MANY of these whoa dude scenarios is coincidence. Last year my wife and I were sitting on a hotel balcony in Hawaii drinking glasses of wine, and in a moment where we stopped talking all of a sudden there was a shooting star, right in front of our faces. Was that a sign of some kind? What if we happened to have been talking about God in that moment -- would that be a message?? Or would it be two events juxtaposed whose only significance is that they're both witnessed in our consciousness? In 4 days we're going back to Hawaii, to that same hotel in fact, and the difference this time is that my wife is 6 months pregnant -- was that shooting star some kind of good omen?

What I'm arguing here is that it's not as simple as witnessing something supernatural. It's also a matter of overcoming an innate resistance to assume that that something I've witnessed is supernatural -- and this probably requires repeated occurrences as well as validation from others to make sure I'm not crazy. That's why the supernatural works for religions -- because it's validated within a whole community, which to some degree shares interpretation.

And isn't that what we've been talking about over in the evolution thread, about what science really is? Science is a type of group validation, in which you're not just making observations -- you're making observations under controlled circumstances (to the degree possible), then letting the whole world know the parameters of your observations so that they can repeat them if they want.

Life experience need not be as rigorous as a science lab. But if you see something that doesn't jive with your experience of reality, you may want to make sure someone else sees it too before you assume its truth -- there are lots of associations and interpretations we make.

Because I'll believe anything if it exists in the realm of credible experience, which includes brains other than mine. But on my own I'm more likely to believe I've lost it than I am to believe in vampires and goblins and fire breathing dragons, or to believe that I'm being visited by dead relatives -- so the day I start seeing those, and no one else can corroborate it, is the day I check myself into the "farm".
 
 
@Scattered,

Ok, well I might border on being just annoying here, but I'm not sure I've got the direct answer yet, but maybe I misread and you did give it when you said that you would believe thing you witness...

Anyhow, if not, take my silly metiorite scenerio- now pretend that it was a spontanious thing that you asked for that sign, so no one could possibly pulled a trick on you. And pretend that 5 of your most sober minded friends were in the room, heard your request, and verified that the event occured. Would that work for you? I know that there is something difficult to overcome to believe in an event being "supernatural" (and I personally feel more like a skeptic and cynic than otherwise, so I think I relate for the most part), but is there a point where you would believe it? Or would you actually catagorically refuse to believe it and consider yourself crazy even if a verifiable sign occured? (I realize my story here is nuts, but if you can, just play along for the theoretical discussion.)

Also- no I hadn't heard of that cage experiment... Doesn't sound too hopefull does it? :rolleyes:

Yup. I'd believe it. And I'd either somehow dismiss it through some psychological compensating mechanism, or I'd become like all the people who have witnessed UFOs, trying to convince the world not to ignore me.

If you see something, does that not equate to knowing it, and if you know it, why is it necessary to not be ignored? I have tried to tell people stuff they do not believe at all, because I find it necessary, and even think it is true. Then. I'm done. I have fulfilled my obligation to my fellow humans, and if they ignore me -fine. Considering the world has smoked many a person for getting out of line, I'll take ignorence in preference to being the main entertainment on any given day.

Haha, quite right. In that exact scenerio I'd think about melting the thing down, selling the metals, and trying to convince the world to ignore me.  

Anyhow, believing that you have witnessed something supernatural doesn't mean that you need to in turn try to make everyone else believe through that one event, though it might be good enough for you and those who know you well enough to believe that you're telling the truth. And of course even after the potential acknowledgement of the supernatural through such a crazy event, there would be more questions created than answered. So it also comes down to a hope (and a faith) that the supernatural has revealed more about itself than simple signs. Crazy signs might be able to point us in the right direction, but if a God does exist, it's pretty obvious that answering all of our personal questions is not His first priority. Which would raise the question of why wouldn't he want to answer all of our questions... Anyway, I don't pretend that a simple sign solves it all. At the same time I do believe that at times God has and does reveal Himself in ways that demand a logical and rational response.

PS. I can give a non-hypthetical example of such a situation that has been important one to me, if you're interested. If not, no harm done.

You know if it is God's Will that man should know Him then the only way that man can know God is that God would reveal Himself to you, which on one hand "why it shouldn't be incumbent upon God to reveal himself to humans?" is a valid question. But on the other hand you have to ask my friend you have to ask Him. Been there. My plea was God I don't know any one who knows you. Problem resolved, tho I did not expect an answer, nor did I look for those who did, after I asked. If you ask He will answer.

Well, I think that if by God or by natural processes the basic operations of the universe remain consistent, then we should judge all things rationally or no things rationally. If God operates inconsistently (like establishing laws of nature and then violating them with miracles), then we'll never know when to be rational and when not to. The third possibility is that it's our own reason that's faulty, and we must always question what we think we understand.[/quote]

No, not at all. The rote sensory experience of seeing something in no way depends on all of the organizing and associating functions of consciousness that contribute to knowing something.

I value your point of view on the matter, and I respect your beliefs. Deep down I feel that if people are good to one another, then whether or not God's inspiration is at the heart of their actions, we can all live the ideal of godliness however the world appears to us, whether there is a God in the end or not. And if there is a God, and if there is a judgement, I hope we are judged on how good we were to other people more than how much devotion or belief we showed.
 
 
@Aedes,

 
No, not at all. The rote sensory experience of seeing something in no way depends on all of the organizing and associating functions of consciousness that contribute to knowing something.

 

How far are you going to make an issue of an experience independent on all the organizing and associating functions of consciousness. Perhaps you should be ignored and should ignore yourself.

Have you ever considered that presidential candidate -Dennis Kusinich who admitted to seeing a UFO? LIke; What the hell is that? I don't know. I can't identify it. But I saw it. -And those high priced press people had a big yuck about that. Why? Should he have lied? Said nothing, perhaps? Does seeing a UFO mean you believe in moon men? The point is, I have never seen one, but I have seen all kinds of crap fall out of space from little motes to huge showers. The fact is that I have seen worse things, after a fashion. I see the death that comes out of industry and foreign policy. I see the lies and the corruption that come out of washington. I see the terrible obscene grasping for power among our religious institutions, and sure, I'll tell you what I see; but I would rather be ignored than make an issue of it. How does that song go? Every body knows, that's the way it goes, and everybody Knows. When everyone has as their sole defense the ability to deny reality, or to deny consequences based upon their ignorance, how bad should anyone want to rip the veil off of anyones eyes? People will figure things out for themselves. Why kill yourself delivering the news?

That is easier said than done. What people say they know, depending upon the person, usually requires an abundance of evidence, and yet, any amount of proof of what may be invisible does not equate to knowledge. Knowledge is never absolute, but reality is absolutly what it is, and experience of reality visually- is as essential as any other sense. So seeing is believing if only because we cannot begin to know what we cannot see. It is not unusual to have ignorance equated to blindness, and wisdom equated to sight.

Are you now equating believing with knowing ?

Irrespective of what reality absolutely is, our faculty of vision presents us with a very limited slice of that reality. Our high acuity vision has a narrow angle of view, we can only see light between ~ 400 and 700 nm wavelength, only of a limited dynamic range (around a 2^12-fold range of intensity, or ~ 12 "stops" in photographic terms), etc. Furthermore, our ability to recognize something depends on the amount of time we see it, whether it's obstructed or not, and how intense our attention to it is.

So what we see with our eyes is some sort of distillation of reality, but it's physiologically limited from the very beginning, and this all occurs before we begin to think about what we've actually seen.

Finally, we have senses that are much more in tune with reality (i.e. less prone to error) than vision.

1. Proprioception: I know where my fingers are. If I lift one hand above my head I know that it's up there whether I can see it or not. If I extend two fingers I know which two I've extended.

2. Balance and equilibrium: I know if I'm at rest; I know if I'm accelerating; I know if I'm changing directions; I know if I'm tipping over.

3. Position: I know if I'm right-side up. I know if I'm upside-down.

These are DIFFERENT than the sense of "touch" (they're both neurologically and functionally different), and there is far less room for flawed interpretation than there is with vision, especially fleeting visions of things that are unfamiliar to us.
 
 
@Scattered,

On the matter of Faith (mentioned a few postings back), Knowledge, and I will throw in obedience, reason being that I believe the word trust instead of( faith/obedience) is better because of religion's hack job on the meaning of faith in the world. If you trust something you response with an action. It has been state by Apostle Paul:
" Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."

If you trust, or trusted your parents when it came to dealing with things in the world such as staying out of trouble, or how to handle things on your own, though you did not yet experience what you are told of, if you trusted your parents you would respond to such things as they said, and got the result that they said you would. (This is excluding any malfunction in this area such as lousy parents).

The Lord, Jesus the Christ came and said. If you trust the Word of God then you will respond. Faith is not blind, faith requires the knowledge (as in given by the parent). How are you to know what to do without the knowledge? Is it not wiser to learn then do, then do find and out your wrong and pay the price, or loss out. In the case of the scripture above Paul goes on to use the examples of the OT people of faith or trust in God's Word. In other words trusting God's Word is to respond as if you know it's the Truth.

Jesus witnessed God the Father as the Son to the world so that the world may know God. If you don't trust what Jesus said then how could He have done that which He did if what He said is not true.
 
 
@dpmartin,

How, again, is your parent's knowledge your knowledge? Certainly, they can give well considered suggestion, but how will you know what it is to have a hangover if you never have one? How will you know that loving your neighbor is good, if you do not love your neighbor?

Trust is not the whole of faith. Trust is part of the practice of faith, to trust others and to trust yourself. But Trust cannot replace knowing.
 
 
@Aedes,

 
Lest you forget, you are the one who proposed that seeing is knowing and then went down a logical argument based on that presupposition. Are you contradicting that now?

 

Not really. That is the difference between religion and science. If you don't believe in joimes, science will magnify them. If you don't believe in God, no power of magnification will prove a thing.

 
Are you now equating believing with knowing ?

 

Not really, but believing is in no sense diminished by knowing. To believe what there is no evidence for is difficult. The great value of myth in all cultures is that it gives an explanation of why things are as they are. Why the bear has no tail is as useful as the seven day creation. And there needs to be no great detail. The world of creation only has to be this world, and in the sense that it does not match, the myth is in trouble.

 
Irrespective of what reality absolutely is, our faculty of vision presents us with a very limited slice of that reality. Our high acuity vision has a narrow angle of view, we can only see light between ~ 400 and 700 nm wavelength, only of a limited dynamic range (around a 2^12-fold range of intensity, or ~ 12 "stops" in photographic terms), etc. Furthermore, our ability to recognize something depends on the amount of time we see it, whether it's obstructed or not, and how intense our attention to it is.

 

I agree with this. We do not see everything, and yet we can sense a degree of reflected light from the matter we are about. Let me put it this way. You may not see everything that is there, but how often do you run into matter that is there that you can't see is there unless you have had six for the ditch. Sight corresponds to reality. Computers have made a farce of photographic evidence. We have other explainations of visions; but seeing is believing as a first step to knowing.

 
So what we see with our eyes is some sort of distillation of reality, but it's physiologically limited from the very beginning, and this all occurs before we begin to think about what we've actually seen.

Finally, we have senses that are much more in tune with reality (i.e. less prone to error) than vision.

I would suggest that these are gross sensitivities compared to vision, but not inessential. These senses normally work together, and help people to sense when reality is out of balance. If I may give you an example. I have always had trouble with my ears, sinuses, and balance. Yet, I am a retired Ironworker who used to walk that high Iron. I don't want to suggest that I fall over in the dark, but I get conflicting information from my ears, and so always kept my balance by sight. To have a welding hood come down accidently while crossing a beam has cost men their lives, and put others in the hole. I want to tell you, there is nothing worse in my case, other than standing on top of a column, connecting, having to look into a clear blue sky for a piece of iron coming on the hook with nothing more than the sun for orientation. I hope life never demands such courage from me again. I don't know how I did it.

If you had three times the computers and twice the fingers and you multiplied each by nine do you think you could communicate to one with out a mind? Faith is easy. It is the lazy man's knowledge. Everyone with some gumption doesn't stop askin with the first answer.
 
 
@Fido,

I have trouble calling faith the lazy man's knowledge. Faith implies knowledge. How can you have faith that is not arbitrary if you have no understanding of your faith?

Faith seems very difficult. How many times did Jesus reprimand someone for having too little faith?
 
 
@Scattered,

Didymos Thomas

Lets see;
The experience (knowledge) of the parent passing on what they know to the child. Would that be, could that be, knowledge? Sorry I didn't know I had to explain that deep concept to you.

"Trust is not the whole of faith."
So why don't you tell us what the difference is between trust and faith.
 
 
@dpmartin,

The experience of the parent is the parent's knwoledge. It is not the experience, nor the knowledge of the child.

 
"Trust is not the whole of faith."
So why don't you tell us what the difference is between trust and faith.
 

I didn't say there was a difference. I said Trust is not the whole of faith, that trust is not everything. Trust is part of the practice of faith, but faith still needs understandings. Trust cannot replace understanding. Again, if you have no understanding of a belief, it is an arbitrary belief.

I don't know how you did it either. But you are completely correct that these senses need to complement each other. Proprioception, vision, and balance are neurologically linked (and the pathways well worked out). This is why you get carsick from reading in a car -- because your vision and your balance are telling your brain different things (and these link up with your parasympathetic nervous system which, via vagal effects, can cause nausea and fainting).

What you may be seeing in the gospels is the influence of Paul. James was much more keen on acts. And the Muslims, like James believe they will be judged on the their deeds. There has been a real cycle in Christianity, first away from Judaism and then back again. I like the Muslims only because they manage to be more Christain. Usually.

"The experience of the parent is the parent's knwoledge. It is not the experience, nor the knowledge of the child. "

Then your saying that what is known as in 2+2=4 that information, knowledge, know how, can not be passed from one person to an other. How is it that one needs to experience 2+2=4 when the experience of the other that passed it on, is sufficient in the real world? You know, schools, education, degrees. It seems in your mind that would be irrelevant, because you didn't experience it. Therefore if you don't know it or experience it, it does not exist. Therefore how can it be knowledge unless you experience it. That's a ruff way to go through life, and frankly an immature view of things.

Last I checked, if one is not the whole of the other then they are not equal therefore there is a difference. So ether faith is trust, or there is a difference between the two. Which is it?

How is it that trust is not all of (or not equal to) faith but yet faith still needs understanding and trust can not replace faith but yet you say you said there is no difference but yet you say there is.

Once again you say one thing, then another, without a point, insisting that you have one that should be responded to.
 
 
@dpmartin,

 
What you may be seeing in the gospels is the influence of Paul.
 

I doubt it. Paul's Gospel was the last written Gospel, much to late to influence the earlier works of Mathew or Mark, or even Luke. Not to ignore the influence of Paul and his Gospel - from that text, many concepts were adopted by mainstream Christianity which are not found anywhere else in the Gospels.

 
James was much more keen on acts. And the Muslims, like James believe they will be judged on the their deeds. There has been a real cycle in Christianity, first away from Judaism and then back again. I like the Muslims only because they manage to be more Christain. Usually.
 

I do have to agree with you here. Jesus is the second most prominent character in the Quran, and they take his words very seriously.

When Jesus speaks of faith, in the first three Gospels anyway, I think faith implies works, deeds. If you have real faith, then your actions will reflect your faith. If you do not have real faith, your actions will reflect this as well. Somehow (well, I have some ideas about it, but that's another story) the Christian church has placed so much influence on faith without understanding, that some even argue all one must do is ask forgiveness from the Lord, as if saying some magic words changes everything. This is horribly dangerous, especially to those who buy into such notions.

 
Then your saying that what is known as in 2+2=4 that information, knowledge, know how, can not be passed from one person to an other.
 

No I'm not. Information can be passed on, not experience or knowledge, these must be verified by the person. How can I have the experience of my parents only by hearing their stories?
I am told 2+2=4. I notice that if I have two pens, and find two more, I now have four pens. If I discovered that instead such a situation left me with five pens, I would at least have some critical questions for whoever instructed me on 2+2=4.

 
How is it that one needs to experience 2+2=4 when the experience of the other that passed it on, is sufficient in the real world?
 

Is it suffieicnt just to be told something?
If someone say's "God is over there!" do you take their word for it, or go have a look for yourself?

 
It seems in your mind that would be irrelevant, because you didn't experience it.
 

Didn't experience what? School? I have a high school diploma (not really, but we'll just play along for the point) and went to high school for four years to get it. How is this not experience?
Similarly, if you go to college, take the classes, read the mateiral, write the papers, ect, you had the experience.

 
Therefore if you don't know it or experience it, it does not exist.
 

What? You keep making the boldest assertions about what I'm saying, despite me never have said anything of the sort. If you have no experience of it, you, yourself do not know it. You may have a portion of another's knowledge of something through the report of another, but this is not your knowledge.
I have never seen a zebra, but I do not contest their existence. I might say, they are white with black stripes because I have seen them on TV, but even this is not my knowledge, it is someone elses being told to me.
If I go to Africa, and see the zebras, then I have knowledge of them - I have seen them, and all the hues of black and white they have, smelled them, watched them run, eat and live.

 
That's a ruff way to go through life, and frankly an immature view of things.
 

When we've wiped away your assumptions about my position on the matter, you may want to reconsider this.

 
Last I checked, if one is not the whole of the other then they are not equal therefore there is a difference. So ether faith is trust, or there is a difference between the two. Which is it?

 

That faith is comprised, in part, by trust. Trust is faith, faith is not trust.

 
How is it that trust is not all of (or not equal to) faith but yet faith still needs understanding and trust can not replace faith but yet you say you said there is no difference but yet you say there is.
 

Your misconceptions about my arguments aside:
All of faith requires understanding - trust requires understanding, honesty requires understanding, ect. How can trust replace something that trust requires?

 
Once again you say one thing, then another, without a point, insisting that you have one that should be responded to.
 

The only point I have is to bring up what appear to be incoherent claims, and root out the misunderstanding.

You compared trusting God to trusting parents, and I agree this is a good comparison; they all love you very much, and want the best for you, certainly have no intention to lead you astray.
The problem is, just like you should not take anything you are told as true until you know for yourself, you should not take that which is even supposed to be the word of God (the Gospels, scripture, teachings) as true until you know for yourself.
 
 
@Didymos Thomas,

 
Is it suffieicnt just to be told something?
 

For many things, yes it is. Have you gone and verified all of the things you 'know', like that the earth is round and that Michael Jordan is tall?

And in a non-circular way, how have you verified any religious belief? How have you verified that Jesus ever lived? How have you verified the divinity of the scriptures that recount his story (let alone their accuracy)? Unless you speak Aramaic and ancient Hebrew, how have you verified that the translated scriptures bear any resemblance to their original?
 
 
@Aedes,

If you tell me there is a horse walking down the street, I can go to my window to verify this. If you tell me Michael Jordan is tall, I can't look out the window to verify that claim. We have to ask ourselves, what can we do to verify X claim? How much can we do to verify it?
We also have to ask ourselves, how outlandish is the claim? The more outlandish, the more verification is needed. Also, how important is the issue? I may take your word that MJ is tall, because I really don't care, but if we talk about God, that is important, and just someone's word is not enough.

 
Have you gone and verified all of the things you 'know', like that the earth is round and that Michael Jordan is tall?
 

As for these two bits of knowledge, I've seen the curviture of the earth when the sun rises, and I've noticed that you see the top of a ship's mast before the rest of the ship; a dear friend of mine has met Michael Jordan in person - aparently he is taller than most, though, my friend says he seems taller because he is so famous. She was a little star struck.

 
And in a non-circular way, how have you verified any religious belief?
 

Well, depends on what you call religious. I've verified that compassion is a good thing to practice towards all people, for example.

 
How have you verified that Jesus ever lived?
 

As a historical figure, a man named Jesus lived and was crucified, but that's about all I know. I think we can make some well informed quesses about things he said, where he lived, ect.

 
How have you verified the divinity of the scriptures that recount his story (let alone their accuracy)?
 

Their divinity? AS being any more divine than any other text? No. Their historical accuracy? No.

 
Unless you speak Aramaic and ancient Hebrew, how have you verified that the translated scriptures bear any resemblance to their original?
 

Luckily for me, and others who do not speak those languages, some people do speak them. I can read what they have to say about the matter, and make an informed decision.

I'm not saying that the learning of others is of no use to us. What I am saying is that being told something is not simply enough. Especially when we consider God, and religion. Think for yourself. However dangerous the endeavor.
 
 
@Scattered,

All I'm saying, of course, is that except for our own personal experiences, almost everything we know boils down to something that we just have to accept without much investigation. My patients have to accept nearly everything I say based purely on their confidence (or lack thereof) that I know what I'm talking about. And with the exception of my own research and my own experiences, everything that I know as a medical subspecialist comes from my confidence in other people's research.

So in other words, the sufficiency of just being told something is a case-by-case determination -- and differs from person to person.
 
 
@Aedes,

To some extent I agree, but I think there is more to this. We certainly have our own reason to wade through the claims of others, or is this of no value when facing the claims of our parents? If our parents say "The sky is green, the ocean is blue" we accept the arbitrary difference? Hopefully not.

I imagine you had your own faculties of reason, and if those faculties noticed what seemed to be a problem, you asked your instructor. If your instructor's reply is unsatisfactory, you can read a book, ask another teacher, ect. Similarly, your patients have their own faculties of reason and can ask questions of you, or have a second opinion.

Also, isn't their a hierachry of concern? If someone says, for example, "I met a guy named James in England; he was a nice fellow." why should I reject this? I'm not sure I'd care enough to explore a rejection, and even if I did, what could I do? Go look for James? But if someone says "God is here!" or "God is there!" this is very serious, and important - worth a great deal of investigation, and careful consideration. Further, there is no reason to accept something until you are certain about it when the matter is so significant. For James, who care? For God, great care should be taken.

I agree about the hierarchy. But the problem is not only a question of testimony, but the fact that we cannot locate a Jesus or Mohammed, peace be upon them, to examine their person's, body and mind to see what they may be, -to have said what they said. We have plenty of evidence of people with schizophrenia hearing voices. We have plenty of evidence for true believers being gd nuts. We do not only have testimony, but testimony on testimony, and in the case of the old testiment we have separate hands and redactions too. The common thread to all religions is support of local morality. If religions were not good for people, then those following them would die out. This is happening in America.

Churches have to advertize, when, if they doing their job people would flock to them. In both open, and in subtle ways churches justify cruelty to themselves and others. And this has been a trend especially in the third world where the churches that preach that man has no right to justice on this earth are doing the best against those who preach justice. Why. Inevitably those which preach acceptence win because the other course leads to frustration. If the parish priest is preaching justice against the will of some guilded bishop, then failure is not an option, but a certainty. Even if you grant that all Jesus talked about transended this time, this place, and this reality; organizations, forms if you prefer, should work for justice, and be certain they are just. But, these preachers of the word, and these givers of testimony cannot hear what they are saying because they are condemned out of their own mouths. So what can anyone who wants to believe in God do but find God after their own fashion. Words are words, but if you tend to believe in a creator the evidence is everywhere. If you believe in a kind and benevolent God, then you provide your own evidence by being the hand of God. But, while I am still what I was raised as, a Catholic, I can no more follow their rules than the next. My church, like every other, puts God in church to imprison and manipulate God. They control, and if you cannot see the strings between their hand and their puppet, get some glasses. People do not need testimony to believe in God, but they do need testimony to believe in a certain kind of God. I cannot believe in a certain kind of God, so testimony is wasted on me.
 
 
@Didymos Thomas,

 
I doubt it. Paul's Gospel was the last written Gospel, much to late to influence the earlier works of Mathew or Mark, or even Luke. Not to ignore the influence of Paul and his Gospel - from that text, many concepts were adopted by mainstream Christianity which are not found anywhere else in the Gospels.

 

I think you are wrong here. There was no gospel of Paul. The Acts of the Apostles where Paul, the johnny cum lately of all Apostles, was the main star, was written by Luke, and luke also wrote the first Gospel. Pauls part in defining the new church against the backdrop of Judaism earn for him a prominant part in the services of the Catholic church even today. Paul was part Greek, and from that position he made Christianity palatable to the Romans. If you want to read about this period in exhaustive detail you can read James the Brother of Jesus, I think by Issenburg, I'll have to check the name.
 
 
@Didymos Thomas,

 
For James, who care? For God, great care should be taken.
 

How come? People make individualistic claims about God and about the world all the time. Every single presidential candidate, regardless of beliefs, panders to people by invoking God -- so do you need to even consider their statements at all?

When people make assertions about Jesus, I don't even pay attention let alone explore those assertions. Why? Because I'm Jewish, and Jesus is not part of my religion. He has great importance to other people, and I respect other people's belief systems insofar as I respect other people in general -- but as far as I'm concerned it's not relevant to me.

Little children, when they're preoperational (1-3 years old) and concrete operational (~ 4-10 years old) will often accept things on authority. And it's at THIS stage in our lives that we are first taught about God according to the religious tradition in which we're raised. Because of this, we enter our abstract operational phase, i.e. adolescence and adulthood, with points of view that we've never questioned. And that leads many of us to either irrationally accept or irrationally reject religious teaching, and convince ourselves through some process of rationalization that we're really exploring or verifying.

So I don't agree with you that an assertion about God MUST be something important that we have to investigate -- because by the time we reach the point of making this judgement at all, we're already biased by a long and complex process of being taught. If you're firm in your faith, then why would you bother to investigate some new claim about God? If I'm firm in my general indifference to claims about God, then why would I bother to investigate any further?

Aedes -

You ask me why after I've given a post as to why...

Regardless, yes, people make claims all of the time, most of them are familiar. But, yes, I'd say when someone makes a claim about God, it is worth considering. If you've heard the claims before, and know better, might as well ignore them, but if not, might as well investigate.

 
When people make assertions about Jesus, I don't even pay attention let alone explore those assertions. Why? Because I'm Jewish, and Jesus is not part of my religion.

Jesus, as with any other figure, is as much a part of your religion as you make him. Jesus was a Jew who preached to Jews. But I think I see your point - if Jesus does not play a role in your considerations, why should you consider explaination that involve him? Good question.

The answer is that maybe you shouldn't. If Jesus does not fit the notions that you understand, then I see no reason for you to worry much about him.

 
So I don't agree with you that an assertion about God MUST be something important that we have to investigate -- because by the time we reach the point of making this judgement at all, we're already biased by a long and complex process of being taught.
 

The problem is that I am critical of that bias, and am advocating values that work to correct such bias. You spoke of an early irrational rejection/acceptence of religious teaching. At the time, I made a rejection. Without reconsidering the subject, I would have continued with various delusions. Deep consideration has proven fruitful thus far.

My problem is that if the belief, or even lack of belief, is made on an irrational basis, and a rational basis is not built, the belief is arbitrary, of no use. What good is a belief you do not understand?

 
If you're firm in your faith, then why would you bother to investigate some new claim about God?
 

What good is to be firm about something you do not understand? Isn't that just blockheadedness (and if that isn't a word, it should be)?
If I maintain that there is a giant flying spagetti monster that rules the universe, and that all other religous perspectives are wrong, what good is this?

 
If I'm firm in my general indifference to claims about God, then why would I bother to investigate any further?
 

If you're indifferent, why should you care? Because everything you do, and everything everyone else does, influences you and everything else.
But, I guess my question is, if you are indifferent, why are you discussing the matter with me?

Fido - I always do that, people say Paul, my mind registers John. I'm sorry, and you are right about his influence, ect.
You are also right about Luke writing the Acts, but even if we accept the early date for the Gospel of Luke (60-61), the non-canonnical Gospel of Thomas was written 50-55. Regardless, most scholars think that Mark was written prior to, and used as a reference for, Mathew and Luke. It's doubtful Luke's was the first Gospel.
 
 
@Aedes,

 
Well, I think that if by God or by natural processes the basic operations of the universe remain consistent, then we should judge all things rationally or no things rationally. If God operates inconsistently (like establishing laws of nature and then violating them with miracles), then we'll never know when to be rational and when not to. The third possibility is that it's our own reason that's faulty, and we must always question what we think we understand.
 

I think you hit on a few key points here, and some of them I still get confused by... (There are lots of views on God and miracles, so I'll just talk frome my own theistic/Biblical point of view.)

I would start by saying that I can't think of any reason (other than that it might offend me) that God could/should not create an ordered universe and then involve Himself in its affairs as time goes on. If such a God exists, then it is His own choice as to when and how He will act... And I wouldn't say that if he chooses to create exceptions to those laws that this would be "violating" them since He created them for His own purposes in the first place, and they do not rule over Him. And since I believe that one of His purposes in creating was to have relationship with humanity, I am not surprised if He uses His creation to relate to them. As far as how that affects our reasoning... well, I agree that that's kinda tricky. One thing though is that from a theistic point of view, logic/reason/mind is only a part of who we are. We can not live solely based on reason (and that's true no matter what your belief system is), it is a tool (and an important one) that we use as we go throughout our human experience. But it is both faulty and limited- and reason itself can tell us that. So to accept those limits with humility, and yet to use the tool (reason) in a healthy balance IMO is a worthwhile goal in life, no matter what belief system you start from. And notice I called it a balance, not a set rule, so it is not something that you can figure out once and be done. And you mention that we should question what we think we understand, which I agree with you that that is part of the balance, but it is also important to question our own skepticism (which itself is based on what we think we understand). So yeah, it's not an easy answer- and IMO it is something no one on earth will master, but it is something that everyone can work towards.

As far as my own little story, I'll start a new thread for that since theres a good conversation going on here already... Link:

Jesus, as with any other figure, is as much a part of your religion as you make him. Jesus was a Jew who preached to Jews. But I think I see your point - if Jesus does not play a role in your considerations, why should you consider explaination that involve him?
 

 Here is a list  of people who have claimed to be the Jewish messiah, most of whom were Jews preaching to other Jews. Jesus was preaching unorthodox beliefs to the people of a religion whose orthodoxy was well entrenched, so it's no wonder that only a small minority of people followed him. The world of Christianity, thanks to both Paul and Constantine, is almost completely populated by the descendents of converted pagans, not converted Jews. I happen to be born of a lineage that for the 2000 years since Jesus' lifetime has continued to follow the majority Jewish opinion that Jesus' story is not part of the Jewish religion. So questions of Jesus, while important, are external to my personal religious questions or beliefs. But that's ok, because I was listening to Bach's mind-boggling mass in b minor yesterday and some of my favorite art and literature comes from the Christian tradition, and I count you among the Christian people whom I respect.

 
My problem is that if the belief, or even lack of belief, is made on an irrational basis, and a rational basis is not built, the belief is arbitrary, of no use. What good is a belief you do not understand?
 

I agree; but at the same time I'm more of a skeptic than you about the degree of understanding that we can achieve.

 
But, I guess my question is, if you are indifferent, why are you discussing the matter with me?
 

Because it's fun, it's provocative, and it's interesting. I'm not indifferent to the subject. I'm just indifferent to God himself. If pressed on my views of life, morality, existence, the end of time, God is just not part of that. If pressed on my views about culture and Western thought, then God is very central to that, but this is just a truism that we can all agree on. Even sort of atheists (or at least people deeply critical of Christianity) like Nietzsche and Spinoza considered God questions important if for no other reason than that they were societally important and worthy of intellectual critique.

 
I would start by saying that I can't think of any reason (other than that it might offend me) that God could/should not create an ordered universe and then involve Himself in its affairs as time goes on. it is His own choice as to when and how He will act... And I wouldn't say that if he chooses to create exceptions to those laws that this would be "violating" them since He created them for His own purposes in the first place, and they do not rule over Him.
 

But then they're not really universal laws, are they? If they don't rule over everything, then they're not universal. Think of God as a landlord writing a lease that the universe has to sign: "All actions will be met by an equal and opposite reaction. The undersigned LANDLORD, however, reserves the right to enact an exception with no prior notice."

 
And since I believe that one of His purposes in creating was to have relationship with humanity, I am not surprised if He uses His creation to relate to them. As far as how that affects our reasoning... well, I agree that that's kinda tricky. One thing though is that from a theistic point of view, logic/reason/mind is only a part of who we are. We can not live solely based on reason (and that's true no matter what your belief system is), it is a tool (and an important one) that we use as we go throughout our human experience.
 

I agree that our reason has its limits. But I think we first have to accept that our basic sensory experiences have limits and our memory has limits; and we secondly have to accept that our reason is constantly under assault by irrational things going on in our minds (and we could all make a list). So let's accept that our reason is intrinsically limited first and foremost, before blaming apparent inconsistencies in the world on a deity.
 
 
@Aedes,

History, and your family history aside, Jesus is still as much a part of your spiritual life as you make him. You are right, you have followed the majority of Jews, and the majority of people in the world, in that you have not incorporated his teachings into your faith. You are one such person whom I respect. I guess my point is that we can talk about Jesus, Buddha, Baha u'llah, Moses, whichever religious teacher we want. If they (their tradition) offers religious teaching, we can talk about it and consider it. Here, on these forums, Jesus has been the most talked about figure of this sort. I see no reason to leave the others alone.

 
I agree; but at the same time I'm more of a skeptic than you about the degree of understanding that we can achieve.
 

Isn't it better to look, and find that you cannot know, than to walk blindly? I'm not sure there is much we can know; I'm not even sure if there is much to know - how much understanding can I expect us to find? But regardless of how much we can find, if we can do better than we are, we probably should.

I really do enjoy reading your input on these various subjects. Your replies are well informed and well considered. Thank you.

In this process I think we learn a lot about ourselves, fundamentally. We don't just learn (or approach) truths, but we learn which subjects we need to accept intellectually versus which ones we accept in a visceral way. Things we love we love despite our intellectual explorations, because no amount of understanding can create love when it wasn't there before. Love and passion are something else, something that exists parallel to or outside of the intellect. And I think most people who believe in a religion have a relationship with it that is quite similar to love. It's not an academic subject. Studying it and understanding it is one way people appropriate it, or express that passion. But I don't think you can come to religious devotion unless you feel it, not know it.

 
I really do enjoy reading your input on these various subjects. Your replies are well informed and well considered. Thank you.
 

That's very kind of you to say, and I have very much enjoyed reading your perspective as well. And I appreciate your willingness to entertain and consider my viewpoint too.

Is there any reason that what you're saying isn't reasonable? Other than that it might offend or confuse us, I haven't been able to think of one... From a Theistic standpoint those laws are for the natural universe, they are not laws for God.

Another way to look at it is to say that all that exists in the universe is not necessarily material, yet what is not material can still interact with what is material. And our science and reason (which is based on only the material) are simply not able to recognize what is impacting the material. Those things that are not material (usually called spiritual) may follow a whole set of universal laws that we simply can't measure.

Whether it's inherently reasonable to a theist does not make it rational, because a theistic point of view holds reason secondary to God -- unless you feel that God is beholden to the laws of nature.

If our ability to understand life rationally is marginalized by the fact that apparent laws can be changed by God at his discretion, then our experiential understanding of the universe just crumbles apart. I mean how can you ever tell the difference between an ordinary new experience and a miracle? When is something simply different from what you've seen before (but still beholden to the laws of nature) and when is something a miracle by God?

I mean this by way of analogy, not offensively: People with schizophrenia have great difficulty distinguishing what is real from what is not real -- so they hear voices, they think that the radio or TV are talking directly to them, or that animals are talking to them, and the distinction between thought and experience gets blurred. Because of this, their thought becomes disorganized and they can have great difficulty functioning.

For us to presume that the universe does not submit to reason because some power ("God") can capriciously make exceptions to apparent laws -- yet we can never know when he's doing it -- means that we no longer have any basis to discriminate the rational from the irrational.

 
Those things that are not material (usually called spiritual) may follow a whole set of universal laws that we simply can't measure.
 

If so, then there's no point in even trying. Reason and empirical experience are then meaningless.

They are not exactly meaningless. Wee all accept that we are real, and it is us rather than God for whom meaing is an object. That does not mean we cannot correctly presume that a God powerful enough to make all this, the firmament, and beyond -would not have the ability to make and break all conditions at once. Not our problem. Our problem is local. It is not the question of what we can know of God based upon a naturally, rationally understandable world. What we know of the world speaks of the world and not of God. In every respect we are forced to live as though God does not exist to live at all. Theology is not responsible for human progress but for human retardation. When we reach the limits of our knowledge then anything can be. Where anything can be, God is kicking back. I would like to believe in a single cosmos. This view is clearly impossible to accept without offending some one; so everyone should talk about what they know. And then let it go. If science works in this world it will serve my purpose.
 
 
@Scattered,

I basically agree with you. What it boils down to, I guess, is that if you're not a theist, the whole idea of a "miracle" is a rationalization of things that we simply don't rationally understand. So what differentiates a "miracle" from a new discovery or a new experience? Nothing other than the convenience that what's called a miracle is that which supports a preexisting belief system.

So if I look at a cloud and it resembles the face of Jesus, and not 5 minutes later I come 2 inches from being killed by an icicle that falls from a roof, it must be a miracle. But if the face in the cloud resembles Bart Simpson or Elvis, then that near miss is just a coincidence.

I might ask why people add rational to religion when religions have only added prejudice to the rational. Where do they get to be in any kind of race for our attention? Have they added so much to life? Have they founded some moral truths to match their moral precepts? God as a conclusion of religion is not every where all of the time as in our nightmares, but is no where, none of the time for the purposes rational discussion. God needs to be served a paper, and told, you show up there at then, and be disputed with, in a rational manor. As it is, we either believe in God; or we do not. What evidence is that? And as you suggest above, coincidence is not evidence. As a coincidence, I offer that I knew a man nearly killed in the fashion you suggested. And absolutly no lesson can be learned from it. It just happened, and then it was done.

Have you read Genealogy of Morals by Nietzsche? Reason, or to be reasonable or rational, is one of the most unquestionably prized attributes in our society. To be rational is good, to be irrational is bad. That hasn't been appropriated by religion so much, but most other prized attributes like kindness, generosity, altruism, piety, humility, do have religious overtones.

I think many people in religion, including the main thrust of medieval philosophy (scholasticism), feel that anything worth its salt has to be rationally sound. And so thanks to Maimonides, Aquinas, and the scholastics, reason has been incorporated into theology, which is basically just philosophy within the boundaries of a religious tradition. Of course this is not the only school of thought, and everyone from mystics to philosophers (Spinoza and Kierkegaard are good examples) deny that religion must be rational or that it can be rational.

 
As a coincidence, I offer that I knew a man nearly killed in the fashion you suggested. And absolutly no lesson can be learned from it. It just happened, and then it was done.
 

Yup. Coincidence + free association = meaning in our "rational" minds.
 
 
@Aedes,

My take on the relationship between science and religion is this.

When mankind originally developed language, our first response to our environment was in the form of myths and legends - telling stories about why the sun rose each morning, why the crops grow, etc. The Greek myths are the best known of these but every human society had its set of mythical stories which explained why the world is as it is. Originally these stories formed one undifferentiated group but with the growth of civilisation and a separate literate class, tribal legends began to be separated into different categories such as stories about the origin of the world, practical information, religion, etc.

In the relatively recent past, the development of rationalism and the success of science have led to the original mythical descriptions of the physical world (such as the medieval description of the world as a flat plane covered by a circular sky) have had to be abandoned. As a result at the present time even religious people for the most part reject the mythical accounts of the origins of our world which are given in Genesis and other legendary sources. Evolution is one area where the scientific, naturalistic account of our origins has yet to win complete popular acceptance against the more primitive, mythical stories.

There are some areas, however, which are not susceptible to the scientific method. These include questions of moral values, aesthetic considerations, the significance of individual human lives and life in general. Scientific facts are often relevant to the debate in these areas but the key questions themselves need to be decided by methods other than those of science. It is therefore no accident that it is in these areas that the older, myth-based approaches to knowledge continue to persist in the form of organised religions.

My opinion is that although the value-based questions mentioned above are not suitable to the scientific method of hypothesis formulation and empirical testing, it is nevertheless possible to take a rational rather than a mythical approach to them. It is regretable that rationalism does not have the prestige in the public mind which is accorded to science (because of the latter's practical usefulness). It is largely for this reason that the majority of the population continue to place a misguided trust in organised religion as their source of insight into those important questions of life which do not come within the remit of the scientific method.

I hape you are not saying that religion is responsible for morality, and yes, I have read Nietzsche on the subject and disagree with his conclusions. Morality is responsible for the success and durability of religion. But reason alone is capable of terrible evil. The most rational people given to science and philosophy were able to rationalize horrors in war and in the mass extermination of their fellow humans, men, women and children. Human beings whose reason dominates their emotions are hardly human, and yet our culture elevates and trains such people. I think we need to value perspective, what emotions give to each of us should be prized in every society.

The difference between our religion and Islam is that they rejected a rational understanding of God. I don't think we accept such a thing. I expect that in this country few Catholics even read Aquinas when his is the accepted philosophy of the church. All that was rejected for protestantism which is our particular form of spiritualism. And that says what Islam says, that God is beyond our understanding. I don't think that was what Jesus or the prophets were saying. I rather believe they were saying God was beyond our control, while our own behavior, upon which we would be judged, is not beyond our control. Reason is an attempt to control, or at least predicate the behavior of God based upon reason. It is a monumental presumption, that the ordered world we live in was the result of a well ordered God. I think we are better off rejecting this notion of God and finding better reasons for our own good behavior. The fact is, that most people, even those who pray the loudest, and vote their beliefs live in two worlds. They go where they light of God shines on them, and then return to their worlds. They do not pray for miracles when they get sick, but go to a doctor and then pray. God gets the credit, and they get the bill. I don't think humanity can be understood without seeing the large capacity each person has as a container of contradictions. Most of the heat generated in any dispute with people is from that point where contradictions between what people know and what they believe are revealed. People do not want to think they are hypocrits, or false, or ignorent. If their religion supports the world of desires where evil is punished and goodness rewarded, they do not feel so bad about living in another world six days out of seven where evil always wins.

And association is the beginning of rationalization. Thanks

@Aedes,

Science and religion have absolutely nothing to do with each other.

One uses a rational approach to explain natural phenomena while the other attempts to do the same using irrational and unprovable arguments.

The truth is that no philosopher has ever been able to successfully deduce the existence of God. Many have provided 'proofs' for the existence of some supreme deity, but all have failed in the light of evidence showing otherwise.
 
 
@krazy kaju,

Does religion necessarily include the belief in "god"?
 
 
@Didymos Thomas,

OOOOOOHHHH good question.

I don't think many atheists actually have a problem with religions like Buddhism.

I have to disagreewith your conclusion that science and religion have nothing to do with each other.. Ultimately reality is as unprovable as existence and God. Both science and religion are based upon faith, but science is accepted because it better explains the phenomenon of reality, and it is simple and elegant with the truth. We want to know, and science provides as religion does not. Religion is certain of truth, so it adds nothing to knowledge, but certainty is the enemy of truth is science too.
 
 
@Scattered,

Science is based on faith? Only if you distort the definition of faith.

Scientists must have faith in previous science without repeating it all, but since it's published, including its methodology, then the only thing you really need faith in is that the publications aren't lies.

Scientists don't need to have faith in some unifying physical order. It's enough to say we learn about the universe through observation, and we don't know everything yet -- so that's why we still look.

That's, of course, different than science and religion. I'd say that religion has nothing to do with science, but science has a lot to do with religion.

Why? Well, scientists and science don't preoccupy themselves with religious issues or questions. But religious people do preoccupy themselves with scientific issues, including the existential issues raised by scientific discovery as well as many ethical issues. Religion tries to insert itself into pure science, like in this intelligent design stuff. I don't ever remember science trying to insert itself into a purely religious issue, though...
 
 
@Aedes,

What is the difinition of faith if my faith is your heracy? Reason is a mighty structure with a faith foundation. Science proves, but it cannot verify and is blind to past and future.

I think you misjudge the nature of knowledge. When people learn it is from concept to concept, so that specific gravity is a ratio of volume and weight; both known concepts. All concepts are conservative, so that once established they may be relied upon whether this is in basic math, or area, or mole, momentum, or or or... And from these Facts and Formulas we reason forward, and make presumptions, and in the process we learn. More.

I think there is an obvious faith in a unifying order. Why would anyone add two and two if they did not believe in an absolute sum somewhere. Doesn't this all add up? Isn't math good in this world and the next, since the saints are all book keepers? We accept a universal order, and this matter of faith keeps the scientist looking for that order while the priest takes it as proof of God. I think this faith blinds the scientist to reality, and I trust that when new facts are learned they teach their own logic. If they were logical from what seemed logical before, their reason would have been obvious. It was not, and what teaches people is the leap of insight based upon seeming senseless phenomen.

Ethics are not a matter of faith, but of family. Ones ethical obligations thin out away from ones own kind, and while the best situation would be for all to embrace a human family, I think denominations stand in the way.

Science does seem to go after religion's goat and disprove biblical explanations. Biblers could laugh that off. There is a lot of humanity and a little God in the Bible; and it tells the stories all humanity has taught and entertained itself with, like the tower of beanstalk, and, David the Giant Killer. They told what was important in their lives, and it is not important in our lives. We can't buy their God because he is a puny little shithead. At least Science has made God large.

Why do you regard this as faith in the foundational concepts rather than an understanding that is based on scientific descriptions?

I don't know about this one. If the whole premise of science is to uncover the unknown through reductionist observation, then how does one have faith in an overarching unknown? There are varying degrees of confidence in scientific knowledge from extreme confidence to no confidence -- but this is based on strength of data and nothing else.

Math, I'm afraid, does not suffice for me as an example of some immortal unifying order or even part of one. It's nothing more than a type of language, in fact a technical language. Pure math is divorced from applications, and applied math is used to describe particulars using its vocabulary. Math does not embody natural truths, because it is completely internally defined. 1+1=2 is not a statement of natural truth, it's simply a statement of equality in definition.

Science is concerned with a universal order only insofar as all experiments and observations are finite -- so there is an assumption of repeatability. However, most studies will statistically describe findings which is basically just a statement of certainty vs uncertainty. So the universal order you speak of has mainly to do with levels of statistical confidence.

Now I'm talking about the level of the scientific study and the generation of new data. The patchwork quilt that constitutes scientific theories, consenses, laws, etc, are also founded on evidence while using reason to draw all these data together. But even a law is finite if you question its basis enough, i.e. it's never really a law

 
We accept a universal order, and this matter of faith keeps the scientist looking for that order while the priest takes it as proof of God.
 

The scientist's search is reductionist -- it seeks to divide and divide and divide and describe those divisions. Science looks for processes, constituents, and forces by reduction -- it doesn't look for order. The farthest I'll go with you here is that a scientist needs to assume to some degree that findings are repeatable and therefore generalizable without actually repeating them. Is that really faith? Or is it a statement of confidence in our observations?

 
what teaches people is the leap of insight based upon seeming senseless phenomen.
 

:confused: I'm not sure what you mean here...

Like where? Were Copernicus and Galileo and Newton going after religion's goat? Was Darwin? Was Einstein? Was Heisenberg? Was Bohr? How is it the fault of science that religious explanations are inconsistent with what science observes? Science also devotes plenty of attention to things that don't challenge religion at all -- no one in religion has any opposition to the physiology of the retina or the biochemistry of photosynthesis.

@Aedes,

Science is based on faith?

The only way to argue this is to argue in favor of solipsism.

But by definition, science cannot be based on faith as it uses evidence to support all of its claims. And unlike the faithful, scientists don't stick to their beliefs no matter what evidence comes out against them. Many scientists have been known to change their viewpoints when a hypothesis is clearly disproven.
 
 
@Aedes,

 
Why do you regard this as faith in the foundational concepts rather than an understanding that is based on scientific descriptions?

 

The value of all concepts is that they can be checked against reality and found whether they are true compared to it. If you are talking of a foundational concept like a first cause it means you can percieve of existence as a single thing so if you are a priest you look for a single hand in creation, or if a scientist, a single order; and these are both beyond proof.. Dogma is hard to live down. Once you have written truth in stone you have created an impediment to truth. And the fact is that we invest ourselves in our beliefs. The scientist is on more certain ground and it is a raft on quicksand. Since reality teaches them concepts their concepts must be true to reality.

Look it as language then and what does it say: IS. one and one is two. It is full of statements of being, but why does it count what does not add up. Do you think all this matter wouldn't fit in a tea cup if the energy could be taken out? Math is a model for all of existence. Number is a universal form of comparison, once everything can be quantified. The problem is that the larger share of our lives cannot and so science does not work to properly explain anything, as in the moral world. I do not doubt there is a reason that can be found for what we do, but no objective measure. And to a large extent, religion is fueled in the moral world because churches all preach the prevailing morality.

I disagree. Scientific laws are laws par exellance. They are formulas of behavior. This effect will have that cause, and the cause will have that effect. Laws are no less than formulas, that if one follows then good will result. It is the formality of religion after all that led to alchemy and then to chemistry. It was once high science to burn a lamb to effect a friendly God, and there was no less a sense of cause and effect.

Or is it a statement of confidence in our observations?

 
If science did not look for order it could not discover laws, and without predictability of outcome is could have no formula of behavior, no this before that, and no cause and effect.

Galileo certainly went after the Pope. The Pope correctly concluded that God being God could fashion reality after his own desires, and Calileo as much as called him an idiot. Galileo thought that what was true in physical reality was absolutely true, and infinitely true. And I see that all of science feels after this true thread in physics, as in laws as formulas of behavior, and why? The church accepts order believing we were created by a single creator. Science accepts order because order is how we learn of reality by taking obvious disorder and finding how it is governed. What if the order exists only within the limits of our space? What if the world is regularly destroyed and reformed, and when it is reformed it can reform after any fashion from entirely new parts and pieces? I think order is the ultimate presumption of both church and science.

 
I don't think I read the same journals that you do...
 

Sorry. I don't read journals at all except some odd law journal passed by my kid. I do read books, and I have read on many subjects. That does not mean I am not wrong but only that I doubt it.
 
 
@Fido,

 
Look it as language then and what does it say: IS. one and one is two.
 

No, it says one plus one equals two. That's why you use a plus sign and an equals sign.

Furthermore, if you want to concentrate on the word is, you need to pick your definition of IS. This is not the IS of existence, and it's not the IS of predication, it's the IS of identity. The atomic meaning of this equation is self-contained and self-defining without any external reference. In other words, 1+1=2 is a circular argument.

 
If science did not look for order it could not discover laws, and without predictability of outcome is could have no formula of behavior, no this before that, and no cause and effect.
 

See, I think this is the difference between conducting science and philosophizing about science. I look at science from within, and the whole idea of looking for order and looking for universality is absent from everything I've seen. Scientists look for understanding, indeed look for fundamentals, but in reality the more you describe the more unanswered questions become revealed. In other words, the process of science continually reveals our lack of knowledge, more and more with every discovery. No final answer is ever final -- to discover that DNA is the genetic element answered a huge question, closed a book on an epoch, and opened up a million other questions that themselves spawn more questions. That's science from within. If science from without sees this as a search for order, it seems to me just idealism.

The presumption of repeatability in science is not based on faith in the constancy of physical laws. It's the other way around, i.e. the constancy of physical laws or even their possibility comes out of the probabilistic confidence of any set of observations.

 
I see that all of science feels after this true thread in physics, as in laws as formulas of behavior, and why?
 

Where do you see this?

I don't agree with the idea of disorder here. Lack of knowledge is not disorder. It's just lack of knowledge. Science looks for components, or constituents -- this, specifically, is what data constitute.

What I see is that people learn by their knowledge when their knowledge pushes them to greater insight, but just as likely, looking for an order that is not there, when a whole different logical process is at work will blind people. It is not wrong to think reality does not behave rationally. but the rules of that rationale changes depending upon the focus, so that Nuetonian physics are still valid, as are the physics of Gallilaeo, but they do not explain Einstein's relativity, or nuclear physics.
 
Where do you see this?
 

Where do I see science feeling after the thread of truth? Always, but it is possible for knowlege to get in the way of understanding as when the ptolemaic universe became a difficult fossil that people dealt with because they could correct it, when a more elegant and true explaination would not require correction.

 
I don't agree with the idea of disorder here. Lack of knowledge is not disorder. It's just lack of knowledge. Science looks for components, or constituents -- this, specifically, is what data constitute.
 

Really? I look at every science text book I have, even on the moral sciences and the one thing they all do is systematize the subject. All bring order to apparant anarchy, and I am not saying that the order is not there. I am not denying that there may be one logical system that controls all logical systems. All I am saying is that science chips away at anarchy that presents itself as certain facts without cause or effect, and science seeks the cause and the effect. Data is like the many pieces of a jig saw puzzle, and when each piece of information can be put into a coherent whole then it can be concieved of as a idea, as opposed to so much data, some without meaning and some with much meaning.
 
 
@Fido,

 
So one and one is not two?
 

If by "and" you really men "plus", and using the verb "to be" you mean the is of identity, then yes, that is correct insofar as two can be defined by the sum of one and one. But remember that the verb "to be" has several meanings: identity (I am a human), predication (I am tired), and existence (there is life after death). When you use the "is" of identity, it is close to "equal" (though not necessarily -- because "I am human" is not a reciprocally true statement, where as 2=1+1 is).

However, a literal verbal reading of 1+1=2 is NOT "one and one is two", it is "one PLUS one EQUALS two".

Is it possible for 1+1 to not equal 2? Sure -- just redefine one symbol in that statement and it's no longer correct. There is nothing magical about those symbols.

 
It is not wrong to think reality does not behave rationally.
 

We assume rationality because it is the psychological mechanism that keeps our brain organized. But it is by no means our primary faculty, and the assumption of rationality in the world doesn't make it so. The world just is what it is, rational or not -- the rationality is our own projection.

 
but the rules of that rationale changes depending upon the focus, so that Nuetonian physics are still valid, as are the physics of Gallilaeo, but they do not explain Einstein's relativity, or nuclear physics.
 

Newtonian physics are still valid? They were never entirely valid even at the time Newton described them. Newton's predictions were inaccurate for the observed planetary orbits, he was inaccurate about the effect of gravity on light, he could not explain the equivalence principle, and he erroneously postulated that gravity was produced by motion (which he could not explain for planetary gravitation). While Newton's physics constituted a huge advance (certainly compared with Galileo, whose description was far less complete), nearly all of these problems were reconciled by general relativity and the introduction of curved space-time.

 
I look at every science text book I have, even on the moral sciences and the one thing they all do is systematize the subject. All bring order to apparant anarchy, and I am not saying that the order is not there.
 

For many sciences there are several parallel and competing ways of systematizing things. This is especially true in biology and medicine, where classical descriptions (using ultrastructure, anatomy, microscopy) have been supplanted by molecular taxonomy. Systematization might be intended to organize things according to a putative "ultimate", but it's often just done for cognitive convenience, i.e. ease of memorization and learning.

 
All I am saying is that science chips away at anarchy that presents itself as certain facts without cause or effect, and science seeks the cause and the effect. Data is like the many pieces of a jig saw puzzle, and when each piece of information can be put into a coherent whole then it can be concieved of as a idea, as opposed to so much data, some without meaning and some with much meaning.
 

I think we probably are saying the same thing, but we conceptualize it differently. I shy away from words like anarchy and order when regarding what we know or don't know. Data are not necessarily part of a jigsaw puzzle of truth -- they're part of a jigsaw puzzle of observation. I say this because data can be reinterpreted, supplemented, or overturned as our observational skills improve.

Medicine, of course, isn't a pure science by any means, but it certainly calls upon a lot of science. And people in medicine are fond of the saying:

"Half of what we know is right and half of what we know is wrong. The problem is we don't know which half is which."
 
 
@Aedes,

I agree that we are saying much the same thing here, and in any event are beating a dead horse to a bloody pulp. Peece, and let's try again later.
 
 
@Fido,

Building upon the information posted on this thread (heredity), and the thoughts of the individuals who have contributed to it (genetics), and at the risk of forgetting some of its less useful comments (natural selection), albeit very interesting in their specific context (evolution), I humbly submit that the scientific suspend some disbelief, and that equally the more religious attempt to cast a scientific eye over certain esoteric anomolies, in an attempt to reconcile the perceived seperation of Science and religion. Perhaps discover together the (dare I say) purpose of the original topic of this thread...

Naturally this thread has made for deeply gratifying reading for one who is perched on the fence (aren't we all?) between the two forces that drive our society- watching the battle to justify the more viable. It has been far more entertaining then watching a football match, which as best I could ever tell has NO purpose to speak of. Coming from the Humanities, I take the liberty of quoting Andre Malraux: "The 21st century will be spiritual...or it will not be"...

Can any science which draws foregone conclusions without attempting to search beyond its own paradigms be considered superior in reason to a sacred text which contains the nexus of knowledge? Why would such a field of study leave so vast a resource unconsidered? Is science then only a study of surface perceptions that fragments all aspects of our obervable experience? Or, does Science look through this illusion of surfaces to perceive the truth of our existence towards useful ends?

We do not need a new religion, as has been suggested quite early on in this post; we need to alter our perception, or more accurately: our understanding of what we perceive, in order to advance a knowledge of Truth.

If science casts aside the entire history of knowledge and in doing so, retreats into its archive of empirical data and religion clings to the dogma of its archiac interpretations of the same, both forms die.

A scientific reading of Genesis, to begin, reconcils this perceived seperation of Science (with a capital S) and religion (with a telling lower case 'r').

PS fundamentalists beware of preconceived notions
 
 
@Doorsopen,

Nicely, but....
>Can any science which draws foregone conclusions
Not familiar with that science. Sort of contradicts science.
>Andre Malraux: "The 21st century will be spiritual...or it will not be"...
Very cool.
>our understanding of what we perceive
Here! Here! A little bit of new understanding will help too.

1) Who are we (and what are we worth)?
2) Where did we come from?
3) Why are we here?
4) Where are we going?
Both Christianity and evolution seek to answer these four questions.

Believe it or not, if you add one thing about genetics (re-combination) to current scientific knowledge, it would pretty much explain God and answer those questions, if not prove or disprove God's existence.
Enjoy

These is a terribly misleading oversimplification.
Evolution is an attempt to explain the development and existence of life.
Christianity, religion in general, does not make such a scientific attempt.

 
Believe it or not, if you add one thing about genetics (re-combination) to current scientific knowledge, it would pretty much explain God and answer those questions, if not prove or disprove God's existence.
 

I don't see how. Using science to investigate God is like using science to investigate the life of character from your favorite novel. Science is a tool that doesn't fit that bolt. And religion is similarly impotent with respect to influencing science.
The only thing science can do for us, from a religious perspective, is to further condemn the silliest of religious beliefs - like duality.
 
 
@Didymos Thomas,

>Evolution is an attempt to explain the development and existence of life.
Is not God said most emphatically to be life?
>Christianity, religion in general, does not make such a scientific attempt.
Yes, but is that not what people seek in religion.
>Using science to investigate God is like using science to
>investigate the life of character from your favorite novel.
That is assuming that God is a a fictional character like one from a novel. A true scientist will not make such an unsupported assumption.
>Science is a tool that doesn't fit that bolt.
I think I'm the first one to find the proper size scientific wrench to unscrew the unscrewtable.
>The only thing science can do for us, from a religious perspective,
>is to further condemn the silliest of religious beliefs - like duality.
Ha Ha. I wrote a paper on duality for phiolosophy that my instructor liked. I finally had gotten tired enough to write anything.
What surprised me was to show that the silliest religious belief (well, Christianity at least) is very well supported by science if you just add up a few facts and squeeze real hard. What would I calculate the probability? Somewhere between 20% to 90%.
Besides, without any God, religion is an expression of humanity's greatest aspirations. I would expect we will have to use science to achieve those that we can attain.
Note that though that I can use science to describe a God very very like the one described by Christianity, there is one difference. No one has ever seriously attempted to describe God without a big parcel of MetaPhysics. I can do it with only science. I haven't found anyone really ready for that. Test yourself. Who was more evil, Hitler or Stalin? If you can answer that without prejudice, maybe you could stretch to understand God.
 
 
@Scattered,

If we take such a simple understanding of god, where god=life, then we do not need science to prove God's existence, such a thing would be patently obvious to everyone.

Yes, God is often said to be life, but God is often said to be many things. God is life, God is truth, ect - none of these statements are absolutely accurate, they all point to the inexpressible truth of God. That's the gist of how language around God usually functions.

 
Yes, but is that not what people seek in religion.
 

People can seek whatever they like, where ever they please. You can look for Death under a tree if you like.
People seek all sorts of things in religion - sometimes people seek alternatives to scientific explanations.

Doesn't mean that Christianity uses the scientific method to explain the development and existence of life. Religion tends to be concerned with coming to terms with the life we have.

 
That is assuming that God is a a fictional character like one from a novel. A true scientist will not make such an unsupported assumption.
 

Well, I'm no scientists. And God is like a fictional character from a book. Scripture is literature, by the way.
Any scientists who tells you he is studying the nature of God, in a scientific manner, is a mad man. What would he observe? What data would he collect?

 
What surprised me was to show that the silliest religious belief (well, Christianity at least) is very well supported by science if you just add up a few facts and squeeze real hard. What would I calculate the probability? Somewhere between 20% to 90%.
 

Christianity is not a religious belief.

And I am not sure what probability you are projecting.

Depends on how you define metaphysics. And even then, you would have to answer some metaphysical questions, or at least make some metaphysical assumptions.

And I must doubt that you can arrive at God through any scientific exercise. But hey, I'll give it a hearing.

Well, I'm just a simple biologist so I note those things. Actually though, there is a depth of meaning there that is surprising.
One of the amazing things though is that if God does exist, it turns out that many of these platitudes will turn out to be very simply and literally true... at least about life if perhaps not truth... One of the reasons I wonder... See, I study life and my study of life processes was what led to the strange stuff I found. (I'll mention that I had no interest in studying Gods or religion, but a friend of mine pushed me into it. He hates religion. I was more than amazed at what I found by following the same thread of genetics that I have studied for so long.)

 
People can seek whatever they like, where ever they please. You can look for Death under a tree if you like.
People seek all sorts of things in religion - sometimes people seek alternatives to scientific explanations.

 

Ultimately, religion is mostly about morality. Morality is about survival. Something else a biologist might note.

 
Doesn't mean that Christianity uses the scientific method to explain the development and existence of life. Religion tends to be concerned with coming to terms with the life we have.

 

Yah, you have that right in trumps. Still, I think most things, the life we have included, are easier to understand and deal with if we understand them.

 
Well, I'm no scientists. And God is like a fictional character from a book. Scripture is literature, by the way.
Any scientists who tells you he is studying the nature of God, in a scientific manner, is a mad man. What would he observe? What data would he collect?

 

Yah, but many fictional characters have some ontogeny in fact.
If someone wants to understand God, perhaps they should start with the closest thing we know of, humans. Humans must be well understood before an understanding of God can be developed.
The key to this question has to do with events during re-combination. You might not think that that would say much about God, but it certainly does. God has the same problems that humans have and has solved many of them the same way that humans will have to.

 
Christianity is not a religious belief.

 

Uh.... OK, but I thought it was.

 
And I am not sure what probability you are projecting.

 

The probability that God or more likely Gods, exist...(plural dependant on THE other QUESTION)

 
Depends on how you define metaphysics. And even then, you would have to answer some metaphysical questions, or at least make some metaphysical assumptions.

 

Nope. No metaphysics. That's a hard part for most people to understand. Meta-physics means magic to me or something that science can never describe. This isn't even that hard to understand, though the idea that God isn't interested in magic does throw most people.

 
And I must doubt that you can arrive at God through any scientific exercise. But hey, I'll give it a hearing.
 

Tell ya what, I don't answer that question directly these days, but if you were use Google or MS Live Search to search for instructions for Lobster Hunting, the first result could lead you to a detailed answer. No one has found a flaw in the reasoning so far.
I'll tell ya what, it freaked me out plenty when I found what I found... Still does.
It answers the 4 questions mentioned already, the third and fourth forbidden questions in science and the two objections to God...
1. Why do we have no evidence of God?
2. Why does God allow evil?
Yes that's pretty ambitious, but I answer clearly without resorting to the slight of meta-physics.

Gotta sleep. I hope you find it interesting.
 
 
@Scattered,

 
Yah, you have that right in trumps. Still, I think most things, the life we have included, are easier to understand and deal with if we understand them.
 

I'm not trying to ridicule scientific understanding - both religion and science have their value, and sometimes science and religion can inform one another. My point is that science and religion have essentially different functions,

 
Yah, but many fictional characters have some ontogeny in fact.
 

We might say they have ontogeny, but this ontogeny would not be something a scientist could pursue as the character is not available for observation. Their ontogeny would be the invention of the author.

God has a developmental history - but that is the domain of the historian and archaeologist and people of this sort, not developmental psychologists and developmental biologists. God's ontogeny is not the subject of science.

 
If someone wants to understand God, perhaps they should start with the closest thing we know of, humans. Humans must be well understood before an understanding of God can be developed.
 

Absolutely, to understand God you have to understand humans - after all, God, like all concepts, is a human invention. And science sometimes brings information to the table that is useful in developing this understanding of man. But this scientific influence is a very minor aspect of religion, just religion is a very minor influence on the progress of science.

 
The key to this question has to do with events during re-combination. You might not think that that would say much about God, but it certainly does. God has the same problems that humans have and has solved many of them the same way that humans will have to.
 

I have no idea what you mean, but I'm open to considering the ideas.

 
Uh.... OK, but I thought it was.
 

Christianity is not a religious belief. Christianity encompasses a variety of religious beliefs; not all Christians share the same beliefs, and Christians do not necessarily share any beliefs. A Christian is simply someone who finds value in the teachings attributed to Jesus.

 
The probability that God or more likely Gods, exist...(plural dependant on THE other QUESTION)
 

How could you make such a projection? Based on what?

 
Nope. No metaphysics. That's a hard part for most people to understand. Meta-physics means magic to me or something that science can never describe. This isn't even that hard to understand, though the idea that God isn't interested in magic does throw most people.
 

Ah, you meant magic. I was refering to the branch of philosophy. Yeah, I never bought the magic in religion, either.

 
Tell ya what, I don't answer that question directly these days, but if you were use Google or MS Live Search to search for instructions for Lobster Hunting, the first result could lead you to a detailed answer. No one has found a flaw in the reasoning so far.
 

I highly doubt a page dedicated to hunting lobster on the west coast is going to show how to arrive at God through scientific exercise.
 
 
@Didymos Thomas,

 
Christianity is not a religious belief.
 

Correct. It is a support group/community of similar enough 'beliefs', sufficient consensus, to fall under the common definition of the religion (and its offshoots/branches), Xtianity. To be a Xtian of Xtianity, one need 'belief' in Jesus. Otherwise you (generic you) are a hypocrite and unworthy of acceptance in the religion.
You must be a host to the 'belief' to be included.
 
 
@Scattered,

 
Nicely, but....
>Can any science which draws foregone conclusions
Not familiar with that science. Sort of contradicts science.

 

Sorry, using a literary device that has failed to communicate my idea clearly. Yes it does contradict Science. I become terribly frustrated reading opinions in favour of Science over Religion which are not based Scientific evidence. This was merely a statement to discredit such opinions.

You asked very early on about reading that discusses the relationship between Science and Religion. There are such texts in all periods. If you carefully study Vidic texts or Kabbalah even the Bible and search below the text, in the way that "a lover sees into the soul of his mistress" to quote a particular esoteric text...

It is hardly surprising that you have arrived at a certain understanding through your field of study. "All roads lead to Rome..." as the saying goes and God being in all things is to be found in all things. I take a personal interest in physics and find time and again that descriptions of the physical reality reveal a pattern entirely consistent with every esoteric teaching!

Your field of study, which concerns the nature of life, and the means by which its patterns are transmitted and transferred through that which we perceive as time in the generations of humanity will naturally reveal that aspect of God which is life.
 
 
@Doorsopen,

>>highly doubt a page dedicated to hunting lobster on the west coast is going to show how to arrive at God through scientific exercise.

... You went no further.... tsk tsk.
While that is the definitive web site of California diving, some people have noted that that is not what the site is about.... "the diving is just a cover".
Look again, but plan to be far more observant this time. It is there.

Hey, by the way. Think of this. Faith is a behavior obviously. What would biology refer to it in terms of instincts? See, the funny thing is that GOd needs fait too. It's just a question of what faith really is.
 
 
@Scattered,

 
I don't expect so, but is anyone aware of any reasoning, logic or science about God or God's purpose? Actually, is there anything in religion (preferably Christianity) about God's purpose or purpose for humans?
Not too complicated please. I am a simple guy.
 

I agree there is no scientific or factual evidence that can explain god or his purose for humanity. If people think that religion is logical than humanity needs help. The only reasoning towards religion is the fact that people resort to it because they fear death.
 
 
@MITech,

I do think there is scientific and factual evidence to explain God and his purpose. But you have to have enough faith to buy an eight ball to get it...
 
 
@Fido,

Gads. It's hard to believe this post still has any life.
It's also hard to believe how little curiosity there is here.
I sort of blew this off because originally the answers came from people using classical philosophical patterns of enquiry. Certainly very respectable, but I was looking for curiosity and ingenuity.
Now the answers look like they are coming from a polite crowd on the Richard Dawkins web site using ideological atheism instead of even philosophy. It bores me to tears.
As I said in the first place, science and reason strongly suggest God's existence. No faith needed for knowledge. As a matter of fact, examination of the topic shows how divorsed faith must be from knowledge.
I hate to tell you, but you haven't figured it out...or even tried to which is understandable considering all the time and work it took me. I do hope to get it published though and you will then be welcome to tell me if you can find any flaws of fact or reason in it. No one has yet and many know of it.
Enjoy, Scattered

Get out of town! Science and reason have nothing to say about God, but as we have been able to climb higher and see further there was no more of reaching heaven with a ladder, a tower, a beanstalk, or a tall tree. Ignorance is a million questions for a child, and few of them may contribute to actual survival. So what if you tell a kid that the world was created in seven days? Is the scientific reality less amazing? You need to know. Here is the answer. Now get your chores done before the winter blows ice chrystals up yer bung hole. Let science tell you the truth later.
 
 
@Fido,

I guess you know all science and reason then. Somehow I doubt it. I assure you, science and reason can say much about God. You just have to work up a little genetics, a lot of reason and squeeze real hard.

 
but as we have been able to climb higher and see further there was no more of reaching heaven with a ladder, a tower, a beanstalk, or a tall tree.
 

OK, but I might suggest more faith in science and reason then. I see more perched on it than on beanstalks...

 
Ignorance is a million questions for a child, and few of them may contribute to actual survival.
 

They are survival. They are a part of the person's life.

 
So what if you tell a kid that the world was created in seven days? Is the scientific reality less amazing?
 

Oh, sounds so fundy. It's OK, but at some point a person tends to associate and cross reference their facts so there can be a drawback to teaching something like "the world was created in seven days". In a way, that is the point of what I did. Religion is important. Humans seem to have a religion receptor point in their mind. The trouble is that religion generally has such illogical premises that when it gets cross referenced with the facts and world view a person develops from science and reason, there is a clash. I just wanted to see if God made any sense in terms of science and reason. I found out it did. The value is that the view I created based on fact and reason plugs into that religion receptor just fine, but clashes with neither science/reason or with most forms of classical religion (except fundementalism, which is OK). It's funny though. It has very little to do with faith, which I guess is OK, as faith, on balance, has little to do with religion.

 
You need to know. Here is the answer. Now get your chores done before the winter blows ice chrystals up yer bung hole. Let science tell you the truth later.
 

Uh. OK. Actually though, it is knowledge that we use to survive. You have to work smart, not just hard.
 
 
@Scattered,

I am going to get back to your post. For now, technology has only grown but slowly, so for a very long time the only technology was to get after it with what you know. And I will tell you the truth here, and I am not saying it because I have read few books but many. If you read ten books on various subjects it is possible that you have the breadth of a hundred books. I was told something in regard to Jesus once, but it might do as well for Socrates. It is that if you take twelve people into a room with you together you can reconstruct the whole of human knowledge. Maybe Jesus had never heard of a Greek philosopher, but it was unlikely that all that had went on in the world escaped them all together. So, if you read a few books on various subjects and they are not too old, it is possible to have a grasp of all current ideas and get some glimpses at many past ideas that resurface, or are taken out of the box as straw men. Think of how well accepted a book might be if it went cont rary to what everyone knows. If you are betting on ignorance the odds are better than fifty fifty. If you are trying to sell books or ideas you are betting that the person who picks your book up, will recognize it as a contradiction, or addition to accepted knowledge. In either case, it must appeal to more knowledge than it professes to know. I am tired right now, I don't know if I could make the point better if not. If you read books you can get a better idea what accepted knowledge is, and if you read many books you can get a good enough idea of knowledge to say something bold about technology, and knowledge with confidence.

Sorry, but I've read way too many books. I also have to disagree with you. Even without getting into the technical information, I am sure it would take more than 10 books to cover the categories of human knowledge. Each book by Shakespere covered individual unique archetypes and there are far more archetypes than those. In that I have to handle a great deal of knowledge about humans, I collect archetypes to use for catagorizing what knowlegdge I run across.
Tell ya what, I could follow that, but how about I just tell you one relevant category of knowledge you cannot find in any book. As I have said, religion is not my main study, but I stumbled on that stuff about God. I have also come upon a number of other fields of thought that have not been explored.
Think of this. Day by day, the scientists find some new feature of humans largely controlled by genes, whether it is longevity, a disease or even political biases now. That knowledge can barely be used though, because current genetic theory leads to Social Darwinism... which by the way led to WWII. The study of Heredity is the Third Forbidden Subject in science and you will be driven from academia and polite society if you study it. You say, that is impossible. How could it possibly be done? Ask James Watson. They call you a racist. It works. The genetic knowledge we develop cannot be used until a new moral context is developed with a different result than that of Social Darwinism that does not include racism (quite the contrary). I did that. I found an alternative to Social Darwinism that fits within the original theory of evolution. Note that you can not reference any book that claims to more than very superficially examine the moral context of current and developing genetic knowledge. The ones that do are based on current bioethics which in turn are based on nothing more than trying to be decent and deal with existing problems such as in womb male selection. My moral theory is a proactive view based on a comprehensive examination of the problem and potentials.... No wishful thinking involved.
I've already said where I put this all. How about 10 books covering ideas that no one has ever explored before?

You are wrong again.. Shakespeare did not creat new characters because his drama was formal, and his characters to an extent real in history, and the two types of tragic antihero, if we exclude immortals like Promeathius, or Achilles, are Orestes who did what he did knowing what he did, and then tried to avoid the consequences, and Oedipus who did what he did not knowing what he did and accepted the consequences. No book can be written that does not reflect in one way or another what is the common current of thought, and knowledge in a society. I have read a lot of books, but in doing so have not encountered a lot of new ideas, but rather new authors with different attitudes. Let me give you an example. If you look at the philosophy of the three major western religions, each reaches a point in defense of force. Essentially it is that: If the intelligent do not control the strong, the strong will control the intelligent. This is really a veiled argument for meritocracy, and for social conservatism, but the intelligent in controlling the strong also weakens the whole of society, so even if they made a reasonable argument separated in time by hundreds of years in some cases, it was not the right argument, but one founded on self interest rather than social interest. It is an old idea common to old societies that they will last forever because no one in the form of society has a sense of time outside of the form. Which is part of the function of forms, to warp time, and conserve a certain state of affairs. But the world changes outside, and no society can think itself safe only by controlling their own circumstances to their benefit within. What is good for the few is never good for the many.

If I may... Moral theories are garbage. People are moral, and societies are moral, or both are not. Yet we all live in moral worlds. It is moral senses that control all our actions. If you do not realize that a person's moral sense is formed before he or she can reason about morals, and that they are for all purposes of discussion, -the person-, then you will never see how futile all moral theories are. If you want to change morals change men, and start with yourself because when you find how difficult that is you will grasp how impossible it is appealing to reason in order to change others. You can appeal to morals through emotion, because moral behavior can only be rationalized because it is not rational.

I didn't say they were new, I said each had a different archetype. If you think there are only one or two or ten archetypes to human existense, I have to disagree. There are many more.

So we are all instinct in your view. I see it as a combination. If we are all instinct, then I wonder why we work to learn anything. You may not learn from experience, but I think most people do.

Partly true. Morality has an instinctual basis, but part of that instinct in humans is to use learned moral strategies. So while you do have to communicate morality emotionally, a superior morality is also based on reason (or something else that makes it functional in reality). My idea was to create a survival strategy, a morality, with reason and then make it into a form that it appeals both to reason and emotion, that is the person's survival instinct, the irrational part. If you offer truth to the head and the heart, a person will embrace it as truth.
As for changing man, that is just another one of those "books" I wrote. We need to adapt behaviorally and genetically. Oh I wrote all about that, but the morality of it, the how and why, has to come first. That is why I mentioned the morality of genetic technologies first. It's a good starting point.

As for changing man, that is just another one of those "books" I wrote. We need to adapt behaviorally and genetically. Oh I wrote all about that, but the morality of it, the how and why, has to come first. That is why I mentioned the morality of genetic technologies first. It's a good starting point.
 

Sir; it is not instinct which guides human morality except in the fact that we bond for those who care for us. In this sense the individual who concieves of himself as such is immoral because he has drawn a dotted line between himself and his community, friends, and family which is not natural. If you want to make people moral, you must allow them communities, and once they have the moral feeling you should work on expanding their sense of community to include all of humanity.That is the short, fast, and only way. This is because ethical behavior demands a sacrifice that few can justify rationally no matter what good is promised. If the good precedes the sacrifice people know for what they sacrifice. If good is denied them as children they grow into individual human wolves preying on humanity like so many wall street financiers.

And if you think there are greater numbers of anti hero types, prove it. Anti heroes are criminals, and tragedy is about their exclusion, but when the audience is allowed to see that we are all the same, acting under some duress, doing harm but not meaning harm; or blindly doing harm as the victims of fate, then we can forgive, not only the outcast, but ourselves, and this is the key to growth and progress as human beings, to forgive ourselves our mistakes, get on with our lives and into the future, and to sin no more.

The Christian phislospher of which I speak is Augustine, and I will try to find the reference, I think the Muslim was Malmonedes. And I can't think of the Hebrew off hand. It may take some time, because their words may have been separated by centuries, and the references are from a minimum of three large volumes. To be fair, Canon law punishes force. While the Muslims accept an absolute right to justice, peace is put in the front of justice for Christians so that justice has often been left waiting while peace was enforced. This is best illustrated by law still current in western law forbidding spolation (Despoiling). If some one takes something from you by fraud, or theft, you actually give them a better title than your self by taking back what is yours by force. So justice waits on the pleasures of law.

@MITech,

 
I agree there is no scientific or factual evidence that can explain god or his purose for humanity. If people think that religion is logical than humanity needs help. The only reasoning towards religion is the fact that people resort to it because they fear death.
 

What has divided Science and Religion, is the matter of "Concsiousness"

(Some)Religion's, have claimed there was a "Concsiousness" that was involed in the creation of everything.

(Some)Scientist's, have claimed there was not a "Concsiousness" that was involed in the creation of everything.

So it come's back to the question, was there a concsious inteligence that played a role in the creation of the existence.

Yet there is such factual evidence that there is and was inteligence and intelectual thought in the creation of how are existence function's, due to the fact that it take's inteligence and intelect for humanity to understand how the existence function's.

Yet, scientists know that a thing can be inteligent without being aware or conscious of it's surrounding's, yet for a thing to be able to use intelectual thought, such a thing must be conscious and aware of it's surrounding's.

For if it take's conscious intelectual thought to understand the complexness of are existence, would it not take conscious intelectual thought to create such a complexness.

Here are some question's...

How can nature program it's self?--->(what programed hydrogen and oxygen to do what they do, aka function how they function)
What programed nature to program it's self?--> (what programed the program?)
Would such an act take inteligence?
Would such an act take intelecual knowlage?
How could such an act not take inteligence?
How could such an act not take intelecual knowlage?
Was nature concsious of such?

So, it seem's like there is factual evidence that point's the fact that there has to been a conscious intelectual involment in the creation of the rule's of are existence that dictate's how all thing's function with one another.

Yet, there is no evidence that there is still a conscious intelectual and inteligent involment at are present time.

So those both group's lack mass amount of information...

So, a scientist should not call another wrong, due to the fact that he cant prove him self right since he/her lack's the power/information to do so, and religion's should not call another wrong, due to the fact that he/she cant prove his/her self right, due to the same reason as the scientist.

Sadly, I, a third party, that dosnt support the action's or thought's of both side's, has gaven the only proof that can logicaly leed to the conclution that there had to been a conscious inteligence in the creation of the rule's of are existence that dictate's how everything act's, and function's with one another in the up-most complexness that it is.

YET, this evidence dosnt mean that there still is a conscious inteligence :rolleyes:pulling everyone's string's...

I donen't see the "due" part of your last statement. It doesn't seem causal or a logical consequence. Not to say ti's not true, but I can't go with your proof.

 
Yet, scientists know that a thing can be inteligent without being aware or conscious of it's surrounding's,

 

That's an unusual being. Even Helen Keller had more awareness than that.

 
yet for a thing to be able to use intelectual thought, such a thing must be conscious and aware of it's surrounding's.

 

...Doesn't seem useful, but maybe I missed it.

Well, science is an established body of knowledge. It isn't all knowledge, it is just knowledge that has been vetted according to certain procedures and standards. So you can pretty well tell if something is scince or not. As for religion, I can go with that, but not for that reason.

 
Sadly, I, a third party, that dosnt support the action's or thought's of both side's, has gaven the only proof that can logicaly leed to the conclution that there had to been a conscious inteligence in the creation of the rule's of are existence that dictate's how everything act's, and function's with one another in the up-most complexness that it is.

Well, most religions go for free will, so "there still is a conscious inteligence :rolleyes:pulling everyone's string's" isn't generally claimed by religion.

Really, I was challenged to look at religion. My analysis just showed, much to my surprise, that what we generally call God is likely to exist and that the descriptions we have been given could be correct. AYC. That is the question here.

My eternal appreciation. If I could wear it, I would wear it proudly. Still, I must say that I would not have achieved it without the help of many, many other beings, some sentient, some not.
Really, I'm not sure I deserve such an honor. I am but a simple biologist, standing on the shoulders of great scientists and philosophers, but if you insist, I will accept this honor, not just for myself, but for all humanity of which I am a small part.
I thank you from the bottom of my cortex.
 
 
@Scattered,

To logicaly and factualy supply evidence, and proof...
(And to put it short and sweet)

Key.
T=True
F=False
U=Unknown

1.It take's concsious inteligence and intelect to understand and learn the rule's that dictate how one or more thing's interact and function with one another at any given point of time...(T)

2.It take's concsious inteligence and intelect to create a rule that applie's to one or more thing's under one or more circumstance at any given point of time...(T)

3.Somthing must be concsious and aware of it's self to use or have intelect...(T)

4.Hydrogen and Oxygen did not dictate to them self rule's on how to act or function at any given point of time...(T)

5.Hydrogen and Oxygen where made to function and act how they act at any given point of time, since they did not dictate to them self rule's on how to function and act at any given point of time...(T)

6. Since 1-5 are true, Therefore there must have been a conscious entity that had intelectualy made a absolute set of rule's that absolutly dictate's how one or more thing's function and act with one another at any given point of time, for all thing's to be and act and function how they do at this present time...(T)

So therefore logicaly, and factualy, there has been proven that there had to be a conscious entity that made a set of rule's that dictate's how everything function's and act's with one another within this existence, since 1-5 are true therefore making number 6, logicaly true.

:detective:Yet this dose not prove that such an entity is still present nor dose it prove that such an entity had created everything and is everything, this only prove's that at the start of all start's there was an intelectual conscious entity, that made a set of rule's that dictate's of everything within this existence function's and act's with one another.

@No0ne,

Ah, some classical philosophy. Unfortunately, historically I call this meta-physics. Good meta-physics. Better than most of it, but little better than saying that since everything is a duality, the only singularity is that everything is a duality (I got an A in a philosophy class for that argument). Still, I won't use it in my form. It may be true. I suspect that in a way it is true. There is evidence for it, but the reasoning is not up to a standard I accept. Maybe that's just unfair, because I found a form that doesn't need it to explain God. Very coherent and well stated though.
 
 
@Scattered,

Creation is not an historical event. It is a continually occuring event. Questions, for example, as to the structure, or intelligent design responsible for the origin of the behaviour of hydrogen and oxygen molecules is relevant, but would be better stated as: Why do hydrogen and oxygen molecules continue to behave in such a consistent way? I submit that this 'intelligence' or 'consciousness' is inherent in the molecules themselves. The molecule demonstrates consistent, unified behaviour because it is being what it is. In esoteric terms the molecule's behaviour is unified with its source and therefore behaves in harmony with that source. This is true consciousness, as opposed to cognition. This consciousness prevails throughout our experience of existence, and understanding these relationships is the role of science.
 
 
@Doorsopen,

Oh Lordy, Lordy. What has been wraught!
I don't think molecules have intelligence or conciousness, though the Gaia theory might cover that in some way. I like, but don't believe the Gaia theory.

>>>The molecule demonstrates consistent, unified behaviour because it is being what it is. <<<
That I agree with.

>>>This is true consciousness, as opposed to cognition.<<<
That I don't agree with.

>>>This consciousness prevails throughout our experience of existence, and understanding these relationships is the role of science.<<<
No, can't go with either part of that. I can't see the logic to the first part and as for the second part, that is not the role of science.
 
 
@Scattered,

 
>>>This is true consciousness, as opposed to cognition.<<<
That I don't agree with.

 

"Consciousness has been defined from a more biological and causal perspective as the act of autonomously modulating attentional and computational effort, usually with the goal of obtaining, retaining, or maximizing specific parameters."
How does an hydrogen molecule, in behaving consistently with its nature not fulfill the requirements of consciousness?

I re-state that: consciousness, as defined above, forms a consistent structure within which the observable Universe operates.

'Science' is the latin form of 'knowledge'. It's function is to gather data which seeks to understand how the physical world works. Scattered, please justify your argument against this definition.

Quote,DoorsOpen

1."Creation is not an historical event. It is a continually occuring event."

Yet the same law's of physics that dictate there behavior continually stay the same.

2."Why do hydrogen and oxygen molecules continue to behave in such a consistent way?"

The reason why is the law's of physic's

3."I submit that this 'intelligence' or 'consciousness' is inherent in the molecules themselves."

Yet the observed movements and acts are seen as intelligence, due to intelligent people's perception of there observation of there movement's and action's, yet what people are observing is the law's of physic's that dictate's there movements and actions, and therefore it seem's like they have intelligence, yet that observed intelligence is given to them by the laws of physics that govern them, and dictate how they must function with one another under any condistion.

4."The molecule demonstrates consistent, unified behaviour because it is being what it is."

And it is only a molecule. For that is what it is, the reason why it dose what it dose, it dictated by the law's of physics that govern it.

Yet people must use intelligence and knowlage to understand these complex yet simplistic law's that dictate's how thing's must function under any condistion.

5."This consciousness prevails throughout our experience of existence, and understanding these relationships is the role of science."

Yet, it is left to "Intelect", known as "The Understanding Of A High Knowlage", and therefore translate's to a " Higher Science".

Yet, it is a fact, that such simplistic form's of molecule's could not create such complex laws of physics that dictate how they function and act under any condistion.

For science has proven that they cannot do such tasks, they lack the physical form for intelectual thought, and they lack the power to create such a set of rule's and law's that dicitates how they fucntion and act under an condistion.

So this lead's to the fact that there must have been some form of entity that used intelligence or intelect in the design of such a set of absolute law's, and if there was intelligence or intelect in the creation of such, therefore such an entity must have been conscious of such thought's and actions.
