By 1326 Queen Isabella had grown desperate and left for Paris, ostensibly to conduct diplomacy over the disputed province of Gascony, but in reality in an attempt to raise a rebellion against Edward and the Despensers. Isabella de Vesci and Henry had meanwhile turned openly against Edward; royal officials were being attacked by de Vesci forces across Yorkshire.Doherty, p.89. Isabella invaded England shortly afterwards, accompanied by her lover, Roger de Mortimer, deposing Edward - the de Vesci family now looked forward to enjoying the support of the court once more. One of the first acts of the new regime was to appoint the late earl of Atholl's young son to the custodianship of Isabella, who then married him to one her nieces, thereby giving her and Henry control of two out of the five Scottish earldoms.Mitchell, p.102.
