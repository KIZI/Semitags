Next up for the Cats were third seed Mississippi State, whom they had beaten in their only previous meeting this season, also on the road. This time out, Kentucky started poorly, shooting less than 30% from the field in the first half and ending the first half down by 11. The deficit went up to 14 early in the second half before Mathies and fellow guard Amber Smith exploded, respectively scoring 18 and 11 in the half as the Cats shot 51.5% from the floor. The Lady Bulldogs were slowed in the second half by turnovers and foul trouble; all of their starters ended the game with four fouls. The Cats won 76â€“65, with Mathies leading the scoring with 25 points and Dunlap adding 22 to go with 9 rebounds, 5 blocks, and 5 steals. The result sent the Wildcats to the SEC title game for only the second time in the program's history, with the only other appearance coming in 1982.
