Two MAX Light Rail stations serve the Rose Quarter area.  The Rose Quarter Transit Center is located on the red, blue and green lines, and is located south of the arena, in an underpass where the tracks cross under Interstate 5.  A separate station, the Interstate/Rose Quarter station, is located on the western side of the Rose Quarter campus and serves riders on the yellow line.  Tri-Met also operates several bus lines which serve the arena.
