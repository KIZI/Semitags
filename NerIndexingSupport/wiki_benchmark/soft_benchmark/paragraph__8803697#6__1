\nIn 2000, the AM station was sold to Vanguard and moved to the 1550 frequency under the call letters KKJY, which allowed for the station to increase its daytime power and initiate nighttime operation. It began broadcasting an adult standards format to fill a void left after KIVA 1310 AM had dropped the format for talk. It picked up the KKJY call sign that had once belonged locally to 100.3 FM, which had a long running easy listening format until 1994. It was branded as \Joy AM\"."
