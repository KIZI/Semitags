Rabbi Yoel and his first wife, Chava (née Horowitz) Teitelbaum (d. 1936), had three daughters; Esther (d. 1921); Rachel (d. 1931); and Chaya Ruza (d. 1953); all of whom died from natural causes during his lifetime. At the time of his death he had no living descendants. His surviving son-in-law and nephew, Rabbi Lipa Meir/Teitelbaum, (d. 1966), was first known as the Semihayer Ruv. He later moved to Israel, remarried and became the Rebbe of Sassov. He had three sons and a daughter from that second marriage: the current rebbes of Sassov, one who has a community in Israel called Kiryat Yismach Moshe, and one in Monsey, as well as a son and daughter in Jerusalem. Another nephew, the Muzhayer Rebbe of Brooklyn, New York, was also seen by some as a candidate for Satmar Rebbe. Ultimately, Rabbi Moshe became his recognized successor. However, the Bnei Yoel did not accept Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum as his uncle's successor and instead remained loyal to Rabbi Yoel's wife, the Rebbetzin Alta Feige Teitelbaum (1912–2001). They were expelled and shunned by Rabbi Moshe. After the outbreak of the 2000 Succession Feud they became the first and strongest supporters of Rabbi Zalman.
