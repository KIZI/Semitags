Genghis Khan and his descendants invaded China, and forced Korea to become a vassal through an invasion of Korea.  They attempted an invasion of Japan and Vietnam but failed in both. Their biggest triumph was setting up their own Yuan Dynasty in China in 1271, though it was eventually overthrown by the native Han Chinese in 1368, who launched their own Ming Dynasty. The Mongols invaded Burma in 1277, 1283 and 1287, and Sakhalin Island between 1264 and 1308.
