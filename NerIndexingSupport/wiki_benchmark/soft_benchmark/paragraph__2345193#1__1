\n\nAlbany Park is a suburban town in South East London, England. It is situated in the London Borough of Bexley, located between Sidcup and Bexley. The name Albany Park was given to the area when its local station on the Dartford Loop Line was opened on 7 July 1935, following the building of a new housing estate nearby. The majority of houses in the area were built in the 1930s, and are of typical working class or lower middle class associations, though a newly renovated private mansion house exists bordering woodland.
