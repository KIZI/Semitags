In most of the tales that use this figure, the false hero is the final obstacle to the hero's happiness. Such false heroes include Cinderella's stepsisters, who chop off parts of their feet to fit the shoe, but are given away by the blood;Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 126 ISBN 0-393-05848-4 the washerwoman's daughter in Black Bull of Norroway, whose mother lies about who washed the blood out of the hero's shirt, but whose lies are given away when the heroine bribes her way to the hero; the king's marshall in The Two Brothers, who chops off the dragon's seven heads, but only after the huntsman hero has cut out the dragon's tongues, so that when the heads are displayed, the huntsman can observe that their tongues are missing (a common motif when a false hero claims to have killed a monster);Max LÃ¼thi, Once Upon A Time: On the Nature of Fairy Tales, p 54, Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., New York, 1970 and the older brothers in The Golden Bird, who try to kill their younger brother and do steal his prizes, but when the youngest survives, those prizes recognize him as the true hero.
