The first known polymorphic virus was written by Mark Washburn. The virus, called 1260, was written in 1990. A more well-known polymorphic virus was created in 1992 by the hacker Dark Avenger (a pseudonym) as a means of avoiding pattern recognition from antivirus software. A common and very virulent polymorphic virus is the file infecter Virut.
