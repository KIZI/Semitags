\nIn 1366, so that the English Crown could assert its authority over the settlers, a parliament was assembled in Kilkenny and the Statute of Kilkenny was enacted. The statute decreed that inter-marriage between English settlers and Irish natives was forbidden. It also forbade the settlers using the Irish language and adopting Irish modes of dress or other customs, as such practices were already common. The adoption of Gaelic Brehon property law, in particular,  undermined the feudal nature of the Lordship. The Act was never implemented successfully, even in the Pale itself, and was a sign of how Ireland was withdrawing from English cultural norms.
