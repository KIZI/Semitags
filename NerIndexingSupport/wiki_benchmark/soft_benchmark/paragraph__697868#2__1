A couple, Australian naval officer John Ingram (Neill) and his wife Rae (Kidman), lose their son in a car crash. John hopes that some time alone will help Rae, who was driving the car, cope, and the couple head out for a vacation alone on their yacht. In the middle of the Pacific they encounter a drifting boat that seems to be taking on water.   A man, Hughie Warriner (Zane), rows over to the Ingram's boat for help.  He claims that the boat is sinking and that his companions have all died of food poisoning.
