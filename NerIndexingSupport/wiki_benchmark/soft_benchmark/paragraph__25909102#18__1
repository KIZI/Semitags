As champions of the Football League, Burnley qualified for the Charity Shield, then known as the Dewar Shield. The match was not without controversy, as the Burnley players claimed that the second goal should have been disallowed despite the Tottenham goalscorer being onside, maintaining that the whistle had already been blown by the referee.
