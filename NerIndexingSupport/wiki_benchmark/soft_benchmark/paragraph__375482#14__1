At the peak of the crisis, the Mercier Bridge and Routes 132, 138 and 207 were all blocked, creating substantial disruption to traffic and anger as the crisis dragged on. A group of Ch√¢teauguay residents started building an unauthorized, unplanned  highway around the Kahnawake reserve. After the crisis, the highway was completed and is now part of Quebec Autoroute 30.
