Norman-Walker had never served in the Far East. He had visited Hong Kong once, briefly landing on the Kowloon side, but had never been to Hong Kong Island. Local people and even some senior officials in the government were concerned that his limited experience on the Far East might hinder his work as Colonial Secretary. Elsie Tu, an Urban Councillor, even commented that the post of Colonial Secretary should be held by a local Chinese.〈羅樂民繼任本港輔政司，港督表示歡迎，大部高級官員感驚詫〉，《工商日報》第四頁，1969年1月7日。 Yet, there were also comments that selecting Norman-Walker in lieu of a senior official from within the government of Hong Kong showed a lack of suitable local candidates from the point of view of the British government.〈英輿論認為，香港本地人才缺乏〉，《工商日報》第五頁，1969年3月27日。 In respond to these opinions, Norman-Walker said that he had served in Africa for many years and was well experienced in public administration.
