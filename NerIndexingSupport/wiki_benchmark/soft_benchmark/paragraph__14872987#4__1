Artillery training utilized a  area in the eastern portion of the WVMA, including parts of Dolly Sods and Canaan Valley, for practice firing with 105mm and 155mm howitzers. Notices in the local newspaper warned local hunters and others to avoid this area during maneuvers. Improvised river crossings were conducted at the Blackwater and Dry Fork Rivers, among others.
