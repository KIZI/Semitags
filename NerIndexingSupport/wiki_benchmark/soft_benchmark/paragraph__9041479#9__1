WBQQ signed on in November 1991 as a classical music station, branded WBACH. The station's programming would subsequently be expanded to several other Maine radio stations (including existing classical music stations WPKM in Scarborough and WBYA in Thomaston); in a 2008 format shuffle, WBACH programming in southern Maine was consolidated at 104.7 FM, and WBQQ was made a simulcast of WTHT. WBQQ was purchased on May 22, 2012 by WBIN Media Company in the same bankruptcy auction as WTHT.
