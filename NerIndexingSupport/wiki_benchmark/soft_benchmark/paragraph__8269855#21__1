Williams is an avid fan of NASCAR in both the local and national levels.  He was first exposed to auto racing as a child attending races on dirt tracks all over upstate New York.  In 1999, Williams was the studio host of the first NASCAR race ever shown on NBC, the Pennzoil 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway.  Two years later, at NASCAR's awards banquet in New York City, he introduced a videotaped tribute to Dale Earnhardt, who had died at the Daytona 500 some months earlier.  Earnhardt and Williams had become close friends.
