Oshadogan was born in 1976 in Genoa to a Nigerian father and an Italian mother. He grew up in Pisa, where he spent some time as part of the local team's youth system. In 1994 he moved to Foggia, where he made his professional debut in the Serie B on August 26, 1995. In 1999 he signed for AS Roma, but left the giallorossi soon later to join Reggina, where he spent two seasons. After a two-year spell at Cosenza, in 2003 he joined French side AS Monaco, where he played only four domestic league matches in two seasons. He then returned in Italy, joining Ternana, which he left following disagreements with the club managements. On May 2007 he joined Widzew Łódź, becoming the team captain, but left his club on early 2008 as he rejected to return to Poland after having been fined by the club management.
