On 30 April 1945, shortly before 10:00, Zinchenko ordered his intelligence officer, Captain Kondrashev, to select two scouts who will carry the Banner. Few minutes later, the entire scouts platoon appeared, each begging to perform the task. After some prodding from the Colonel, Kondrashev selected Yegorov and Kantaria. On 12:00, a massive artillery strike hit the Reichstag. Then, the 150th and 171st Divisions' soldiers attacked.Zinchenko's memoirs, chapter 6. After a bitter fight inside the building, and after several other Victory Banners were placed and destroyed, Kantaria and Yegorov - together with the 756 Regiment's 1st Battalion deputy commander for political affairs, Lieutenant Alexei Berest - hoisted their flag on the Reichstag's roof roughly at 03:00, 1 May 1945, attaching it to Wilhelm I's equestrian statue.The memoirs of the 756th Regiment's 1st Battalion commander, Captain Neustroev. chapter 12.
