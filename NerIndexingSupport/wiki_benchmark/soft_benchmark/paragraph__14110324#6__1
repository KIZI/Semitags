Andrija Mandić decided to enter political life during his mid-twenties with the introduction of multi-party system in 1990 by joining the Union of Reform Forces of Yugoslavia (SRSJ). The party led by Croatian politician Ante Marković was the predecessor of most the social-democratic and liberal political parties across the former Yugoslavia. Mandić became one of its strongest activists in SR Montenegro, the main purpose presenting an alternative to the nationalist and aggressive political forces that were amassing across SFRY, standing ready to plunge it into war, e.g. including the emergence of Slobodan Milošević in Serbia or Franjo Tuđman in Croatia. The opposition in MNE precisely was aimed against the ruling Communist League local branch and their fiery leaders trio of Momir Bulatović, Milo Đukanović and Svetozar Marović.
