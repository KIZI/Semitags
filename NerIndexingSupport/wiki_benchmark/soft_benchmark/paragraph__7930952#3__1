In 2005, the relevant local government body responsible for the road, the City of Wanneroo, realised the importance of the road and the impact on residents in the adjoining suburbs of Banksia Grove, Carramar, Mariginiup, Neerabup and Tapping due to increased traffic [1]. Funding for the realignment was an issue as the responsibility of construction fell to the developers of the adjoining Carramar Golf Course Estate, Peet Limited, and the City's original plans did not call for construction of this road until at least 2008-2009.
