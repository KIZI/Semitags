Cultural festivities during Novruz have striking resemblance to those in other countries of the region, namely Iran. Preparations for Novruz start long before the holiday. Rooted in Zoarastrian beliefs, in preparation for the arrival of the New Year, people do house cleaning, plant trees, make new dresses, paint eggs, make national pastries such as shakarbura, pakhlava and a great variety of local cuisine. As is traditional in other countries that celebrate Novruz, wheat is fried with kishmish (raisins) and nuts (govurga). It is essential for every house to have semeni - sprouts of wheat. As a tribute to fire-worshiping (an ancient Zoarastrian belief) every Tuesday during four weeks before the holiday kids jump over small bonfires and candles are lit, a tradition shared with Iran, where it is called Chahar-shanbeh sori. On the holiday eve the graves of relatives are visited and tended.
