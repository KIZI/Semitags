The Palisades harbor many rare species for the Bluegrass due to the unusual landscape. The state endangered plants found on Tom Dorman's cliffs are starry cleft phlox (Phlox bifida var. stellaria), Eggleston's violet (Viola septemloba var. egglestonii), and tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa); the latter being one of only two populations known in the state. The plants listed as state threatened found here are Kentucky viburnum (Viburnum molle) and False melic (Schizachne purpurascens). The rare Yellowwood tree is also found in this preserve.
