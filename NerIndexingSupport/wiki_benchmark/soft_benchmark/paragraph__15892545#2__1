The station was first started in 1992 as way of rebroadcasting Dunedin's 4XO to the Balclutha region as the hilly geographic location of the township means Dunedin radio stations can not be picked up clearly in Balclutha. The station initially was limited to just a local show on Saturday mornings from a clients premises but after a permanent studio was built the station extended local programming to 7am - 12pm weekdays with 4XO relayed outside these times. In 1999 the stations owner Radio Otago was sold to RadioWorks and in 2000 local programming was extended to 4pm each weekday and 7am - 12pm weekends. In 2004 Radio Works rebranded most of their local stations as MORE FM but Big River Radio was not affected by this changed except outside the local broadcast hours after 4XO Dunedin became 97.4 MORE FM. Today the station is known on air as MORE FM's Big River Radio during local programming and plays exactly the same songs in the same sequence as the other MORE FM stations.
