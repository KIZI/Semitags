Translucent objects, like a living human cell, absorb or scatter small amounts of light. This makes translucent objects difficult to observe in ordinary light microscopes. Such objects do, however, induce a phase shift that can be observed using either a Zernike or a Nomarski phase contrast microscope. Unfortunately, both microscopy methods visualize phase shifts by transforming phase shift gradients into intensity variations. These intensity variations are mixed with other intensity variations, making it difficult to extract quantitative information from conventional phase contrast microscopy images.
