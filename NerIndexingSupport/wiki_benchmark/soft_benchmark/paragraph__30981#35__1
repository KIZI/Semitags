The TTC makes connections with other transit systems of the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit, MiWay, York Region Transit, Viva, Brampton Transit and Durham Region Transit are connected to the TTC via some of Toronto's subway stations and GO Transit's commuter rail stations. Some of their bus routes also coincide or intercept some of that of TTC's as well, such as the Viva buses plying Finch Avenue en route to its North York hub. Via Rail and Amtrak connect with the TTC at Union Station while Greyhound intercity buses also connect with the TTC at the Toronto Coach Terminal, as well as Scarborough Centre and Yorkdale terminals.
