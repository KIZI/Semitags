Łysa Góra  (Bald Mountain; also known as Łysiec or Święty Krzyż) is a well-known mountain in Świętokrzyskie Mountains, Poland. With a height of 595 meters (1,952&nbsp;ft), it is the second highest mountain in that range (after Łysica at 612 meters or 2,008&nbsp;ft). On its slopes and atop its summit are several hiking trails, the ruins of a pagan wall from 9th century, the Benedictine monastery Święty Krzyż from the 11th century (destroyed during the Second World War, now partially restored), and a Święty Krzyż TV Tower. The mountain also features prominently in a local legend about witches' sabbaths.
