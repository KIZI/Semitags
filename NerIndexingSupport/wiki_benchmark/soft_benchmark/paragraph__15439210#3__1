In the local language the inhabitants of Grassendorf are known as \Welschguller\" which means something along the lines of \"foreign turkeys\".   Until the 1990s the spire of the parish church was topped off by the carving of a turkey rather than of the Gallic rooster which is more normally found on the tops of church spires in rural France."
