\nThe IBM 729 Magnetic Tape Unit was IBM's iconic tape mass storage system from the late 1950s through the mid-1960s.  Part of the IBM 7 track family of tape units, it was used on  late 700, most 7000 and many 1400 series computers. Like its predecessor, the IBM 727 and many successors, the 729 used 1/2&nbsp;inch (12.7&nbsp;mm) magnetic tape up to 2400 feet (730 m) long wound on reels up to 10Â½&nbsp;inch (267&nbsp;mm) diameter. To allow rapid tape acceleration (and thus reduced seek/access times), long vacuum columns were placed between the tape reels and the read/write heads to absorb sudden increases in tape tension which would otherwise break the tape.
