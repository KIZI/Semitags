In February 1954, members of the Otter District Farmers’ Institute (ODFI) applied to start a more stable and consistent Credit Union than was currently available in the Otter District Credit Union. By March, they had incorporated as the Otter Farmers’ Institute Credit Union (OFICU), and membership was made available only to those who already held membership at the Otter District Farmers’ Institute.  The membership fee was soon raised to a dollar from the initial price of twenty-five cents.  The Credit Committee was composed of five members and the Board of Directors had seven members including the President. The first elected President was David W. Poppy and a local high school still bears his name. In July 1954, the Credit Union Members held the first Annual General Meeting in Poppy’s orchard (what is now Poppy Golf Course). Fifty people were in attendance, though some were only prospective members. That year’s profits totaled $86.24 and a percentage was presented to the first secretary/treasurer instead of wages. Only four years later, the OFICU had amassed assets of $100,000 and membership had grown to 300 people. By 1963, membership had surpassed 700.  The Langley Credit Union was absorbed into the OFI Credit Union in March 1974 pushing total assets past the 10 million dollar mark.  In 1979 (the same year that the ODFI became the Otter Co-op), the OFICU also changed its name to the Aldergrove Credit Union, since the Farmers’ Institute had ceased to exist.Lynn Chartrand, “O.F.I.
