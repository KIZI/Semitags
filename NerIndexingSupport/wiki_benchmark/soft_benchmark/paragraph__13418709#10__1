Shortly after WLOL's demise on 99.5, KXLV, a station located north of the Twin Cities in Cambridge at 105.3 FM, picked up the WLOL call letters for its Hot AC format. When the station was purchased and turned into WREV, its new sister station at 1470 AM became the new parking spot for the historic calls. This continued until 1999, when AMFM Broadcasting (soon to be absorbed into Clear Channel Communications purchased the WLOL calls for a new station to make its debut at 100.3 FM, in an attempt at bringing back the WLOL 80s-era excitement, albeit with a 1970s-oriented classic hits format. The new WLOL lasted until 2002, when it flipped to smooth jazz. Hubbard Broadcasting considered putting the call letters on one of their stations, even putting a ten-day hold on them with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), but eventually declined. In 2005, when Starboard Media sought out new call letters following their purchase of 1330 AM, they decided on the unclaimed WLOL, hence bringing the well-travelled call letters back to their place of origin.
