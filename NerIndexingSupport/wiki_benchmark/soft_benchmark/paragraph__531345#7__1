After this show of strength against the Romans, Pharnaces II drew back to suppress revolt in his new conquests. However, the extremely rapid approach of Caesar in person forced Pharnaces to turn his attention back to the Romans. At first, recognizing the threat, he made offers of submission, with the sole object of gaining time until Caesar's attention fell elsewhere; but Caesar's speed brought war quickly, and battle took place near Zela, where Pharnaces was routed and was able to escape with just a small detachment of cavalry. Caesar himself, in a letter to a friend in Rome, said of the short war: “Veni, vidi, vici” (“I came, I saw, I conquered”).Stephen Dando-Collins, Cleopatra's Kidnappers: How Caesar's Sixth Legion Gave Egypt to Rome And Rome to Caesar, John Wiley & Sons, 2006Robert C.
