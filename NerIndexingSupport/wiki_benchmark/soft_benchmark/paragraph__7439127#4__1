For the 06â€“07 season, Stephen played for the new Devils AHL affiliate, the Lowell Devils. He was on the team with Mike Pandolfo and Jordan Parise, who also have brothers (Jay and Zach, respectively) playing for the Devils, marking arguably the first time that three sets of brothers were playing for the same system simultaneously. This lasted until Brian signed with Montreal in 2009.
