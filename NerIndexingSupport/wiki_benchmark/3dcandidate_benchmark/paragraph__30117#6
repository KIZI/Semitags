At the time of independence, portions of the Tajik boundary with the People's Republic of China were not defined. This boundary dispute was settled in agreements signed in 2002 that would cede 1,000&nbsp;km² of Pamir mountain range to China in return for China relinquishing claims to 28,000&nbsp;km² of Tajik lands.
