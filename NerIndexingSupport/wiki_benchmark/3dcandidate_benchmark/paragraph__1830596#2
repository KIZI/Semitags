\nThe Imperial Reichspost (Kaiserliche Reichspost) was the name of the country-wide postal service of the Holy Roman Empire, founded by Franz von Taxis in 1495. Taxis had built up a postal route from the residence of the Habsburg king Maximilian I in Tyrolean Innsbruck to his son Philip the Handsome in the Burgundian Netherlands. In 1501 Philip appointed him capitaine et maistre de nos postes, his nephew John Baptist was elevated to a Postmaster General (chief et maistre general de noz postes par tous noz royaumes, pays et seigneuries) by Emperor Charles V in 1520.
