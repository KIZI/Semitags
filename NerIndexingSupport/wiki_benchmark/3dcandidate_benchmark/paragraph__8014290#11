In 1882 the Old Foresters reached the quarter final of the F.A. Cup, losing 0-1 to Great Marlow at Slough in a replay after a 0-0 draw in the first meeting at The Oval. The last sixteen of the F.A. Cup was reached in 1884, 1887 and 1888. The 1887 campaign ended after a 0-3 defeat to Preston North End at Leyton. Preston North End won the first ever Football League championship two years later. The 1888 campaign included a 4-2 victory over Grimsby Town. The next round was against Middlesbrough. The Old Foresters lost 0-4 at Middlesbrough, but complained that the pitch was unfit for play. A rematch was ordered, but the Foresters refused to travel to Middlesbrough to play on the same pitch, so Middlesbrough were awarded a walkover victory. The last F.A. Cup match for the Old Foresters was a 0-6 defeat to Watford Rovers (later to become Watford Town) in the 1888-89 season.
