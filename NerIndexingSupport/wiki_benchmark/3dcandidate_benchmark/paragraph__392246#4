Aelius was adopted by an aging and ailing Hadrian in 136 and named successor to the throne, although he had no military experience; he had served as a senator. He had powerful political connections, but was in poor health. His tastes were luxurious and his life extravagant. He is said to have had Ovid's erotic poetry and \a book about Apicius\" (presumably Apion's On the Luxury of Apicius) as bedside reading
