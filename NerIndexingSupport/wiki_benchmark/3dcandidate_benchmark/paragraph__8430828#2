In 1993 the fast moving, faster hitting Subagja won men's doubles at the then biennial IBF World Championships in Birmingham, England with big Rudy Gunawan. However, Subagja regular partner is actually another fellow countryman, the equally fast and hard-hitting Rexy Mainaky, which later, they form the most successful men's doubles partnership of the 1990s. Subagja and Mainaky won more than thirty international titles together, including all of badminton's major championships at least once. They captured Olympic gold at Atlanta in 1996, the IBF World Championships in 1995 at Lausanne, Switzerland (a repeat title for Subagja), and the prestigious All-England Championships back to back in 1995 and 1996. A partial listing of their other titles includes the open championships of the five strongest nations in men's badminton: China (1992), Indonesia (1993, 1994, 1998, 1999), Malaysia (1993, 1994, 1997), South Korea (1995, 1996), and Denmark (1998); as well as the World Badminton Grand Prix (1992, 1994, 1996), the Badminton World Cup (1993, 1995, 1997), and the quadrennial Asian Games (1994, 1998).
