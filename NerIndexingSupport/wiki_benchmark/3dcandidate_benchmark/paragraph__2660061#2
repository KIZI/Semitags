Suva has had a somewhat turbulent electoral history.  In the 1985 municipal election, the newly-founded Labour Party won 8 of the 20 seats on the City Council to become the largest single party, and succeeded in electing Bob Kumar as Lord Mayor in a harbinger of the national election two years later, when an FLP-led coalition ousted the long-time Alliance Party government.  The FLP later fell on hard times in the capital, however, and won no seats on the City Council in the municipal election of 1999.  At the next municipal elections held in 2002, the Labour Party made significant gains, winning the five seats in the Samabula Ward.  The coalition of then-Lord Mayor Chandu Umaria remained intact, however, with Umaria's Ratepayers Alliance (dominated by the National Federation Party) winning 8 seats and its ally, the SDL (the ruling party at the national level), 7.  Under a memorandum of understanding, the two parties agreed to hold the Mayoralty for one year each.  In 2004, the coalition collapsed, with the 5 FLP councilors teaming up with the SDL to reelect Ratu Peni Volavola, who had replaced Umaria as Lord Mayor the previous year.
