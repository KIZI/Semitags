In 1941, the NYM President Dr. Kofo Abayomi resigned from the Legislative Council of the colony to pursue studies abroad. Akinsanya sought to be the NYM candidate for the vacant seat, competing against the distinguished journalist Ernest Ikoli, an Ijo.\nAkinsanya was Vice-President of the party while Ikoli had recently been elected president to replace Abayomi.\nAt a general meeting of the NYM, Akinsanya received 108 votes, Ikoli received 60 and Dr. Akinola Maja received 37. However, the executive chose not to endorse the vote but instead declared that Ikoli was selected.\nAkinsanya, supported by Nnamdi Azikiwe, claimed that he had been rejected only because the dominant Lagos Yorubas would not accept nomination of an Ijebu Yorubu. Akinsanya resigned from the NYM and ran as an independent, but lost to Ikoli.\nA press war followed between the Pilot and the Daily Service.
