The Morgans and the Earls of Worcester at Raglan became leaders of the Monmouthshire Catholics. Thomas, the subject of this note, is thought to have been a member of the Llantarnam or the  nearby Bassaleg branch of the Morgans of Tredegar Park. It was acquired by Reginald James Blewitt and rebuilt in Elizabethan style to the designs of Thomas Henry Wyatt in 1834-5.
