\nThe earthquake was preceded by a foreshock, which although modest, was strong enough to cause chaos and force people to flee from their homes into the streets. The main shock originated southeast of Ambato. When the primary shock hit, Ambato's main cathedral and military barracks collapsed, as did most of the city's buildings. Scores of young girls preparing for their first communions perished in the cathedral. Shaking up to intensity IV extended as far away as Quito and Guayaquil.
