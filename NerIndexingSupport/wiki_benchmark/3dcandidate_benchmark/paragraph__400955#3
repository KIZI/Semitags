The Irish Lebor Gabála Érenn (Book of Invasions of Ireland), compiled in the 11th century, tells us more. Partholón was the son of Sera, son of Sru, a descendant of Magog, son of Japheth, son of Noah. He came to Ireland from the Middle East through Anatolia, Greece, Sicily and Iberia, and arrived 300 or 312 years after the flood, on 14 May, a Tuesday, landing at Inber Scéne (Kenmare in South Kerry). His landing is synchronised with Abraham's sixtieth year. With him were his wife, Dalgnat, their three sons, Sláine, Rudraige and Laiglinne, their wives Nerba, Cichba and Cerbnad, and a thousand followers.
