This plant is endemic to its range, an area stretching from central Washington, to the western edge of Montana, to the Warner Mountains of north-eastern California. It lives in open upland slopes and flats, within lower montane yellow pine forests and Great Basin juniper scrub, in dry, gravelly basaltic soil.  It is usually associated with sagebrush, being a hemiparasite of that plant. Its elevational range is from 4,575 to  above sea level.
