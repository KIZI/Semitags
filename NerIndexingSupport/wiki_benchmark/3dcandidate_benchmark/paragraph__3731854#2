Their name was invented sometime in the 19th century by the Nyamwezi caravans passing through the area while it was still frontier territory.  Richard Francis Burton claimed a very small population for it, saying only that a person could walk for two weeks and find only scattered Tembes.  There was and remains the problem of inadequate rain for crops and humans, the rainy season being short and erratic with frequent drought.  In the 18th century the Wagogo were mostly pioneer colonists from Unyamwesi and Uhehe, and are often confused with the Sandawe and the Kaguru.  Half the ruling group came from Uhehe.  They had a long tradition of hunting and gathering, allowing the Wanyamwezi to carry the ivory to the coast, but had become agriculturalists with cattle by 1890.  They continued, however, to have a low regard for working the land and are said to have treated their agricultural slaves badly.
