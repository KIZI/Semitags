Factories that run lights out are fully automated and require no human presence on-site. Thus, these factories can be run with the lights off. Many factories are capable of lights-out production, but very few run exclusively lights-out. Typically, workers are necessary to set up tombstones holding parts to be manufactured, and to remove the completed parts. As the technology necessary for lights-out production becomes increasingly available, many factories are beginning to utilize lights-out production between shifts (or as a separate shift) to meet increasing demand or to save money. An automatic factory is a place where raw materials enter and finished products leave with little or no human intervention.\Toward the automatic factory\"\nin \"Electronic Servicing & Technology\" magazine 1982 August\"Toward the Automatic Factory: A Case Study of Men and Machines\"\nby Charles Rumford Walker 1977 ISBN 0-8371-9301-X\"Automatic Factory\"\nin Time magazine 1953 Sep. 28"
