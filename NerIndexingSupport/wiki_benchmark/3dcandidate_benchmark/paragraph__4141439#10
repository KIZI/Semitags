\nMohun Bagan A.C. was a football club established in 1889 in the erstwhile British Capital of India, Calcutta to help improve and instil in the minds of the native Bengalis the game of football. Later on in 1905, during the rage of the Partition of Bengal the players of this club and with other staff members helped in promoting the club as not a 'football club', but as a national entity which served as a base of Indian nationalism. They went onto to lift prestigious titles of tournaments during 1905-1911, the most important being the 1911 IFA Shield led by a Barisal lad Sibdas Bhaduri. In the final match of the Shield, a group of barefooted Bengali players defeated the powerful East Yorkshire Regiment team by a margin of 2-1, thus becoming the first Indian team to lift the Shield. In those days when defeating 'Gora Polton Sahebs' was considered impossible, the victory meant a strong revenge from the common Bengalis towards the Britishers, the latter who had already dominated and suppressed Bengal and Bengalis' voice for nearly 140 years and was still harsh and ruthless(as was seen during the hangings of young Bengali boys like Khudiram Bose and Kanailal Dutta). The defeat inflicted tremendous shame into the minds of the Britishers, which was the primary reason as to why the Britishers had to adopt to shifting their capital from the city of Calcutta to the city of New Delhi in December that year along with the annulment of the Partition of Bengal.
