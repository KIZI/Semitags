\nInside contracting is the practice of hiring contractors who work inside the proprietor's factory.  It replaced the putting out system, where contractors worked in their own facilities.  Inside contracting was the system favored by the Springfield and Harper's Ferry Armories.  Since the manufacturing system developed in the armories also became popular (the American system of manufacturing), manufacturers in the early 19th century tended to hire people trained in the armories as managers.  They brought with them the practice of inside contracting.
