The Walt Disney Company worked closely with the State of California when a portion of the western border of the ranch was purchased for the Antelope Valley Freeway.  This construction was carefully planned so that it didn't intrude into the film settings. In 2009 the Disney Company announced expanding the studio complex, with master planning and environmental impact studies commencing. Golden Oak Ranch is located in Newhall, California.
