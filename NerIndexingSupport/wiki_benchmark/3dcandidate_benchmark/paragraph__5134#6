\n\nChess is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8) and eight columns (called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares. The colors of the 64 squares alternate and are referred to as \light squares\" and \"dark squares\". The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand end of the rank nearest to each player
