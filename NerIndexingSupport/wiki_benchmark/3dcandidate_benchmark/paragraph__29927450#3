The mutant  proregion encoding PAM COOH-terminal interactor protein-1 (P-CIP1) is comparable to that of human band 4.1-like TF (blood plasma protein) as a recycling endosomal pathway in microtubule locations, dose NOT bind RasGTP. Such outliers as afadin/AF-6 and Rin1  were found to inhibit the binding of Raf to Ras. Adenylyl cyclase molecules carrying these mutations are rendered unactivatable by Ras in vitro with the Ras-associating domain-RA,   not all RA domains bind RasGTP it is a primary Ras-binding site.
