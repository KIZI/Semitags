The name cornet derives from corne, meaning horn, itself from Latin cornus. While not musically related, instruments of the Zink family (which includes serpents) are named \cornetto-   \" with a tonal or pitch related Latin word following the hyphen to describe the particular variant. The 11th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica referred to serpents as \"old wooden cornets\".Encyclopaedia Britannica
