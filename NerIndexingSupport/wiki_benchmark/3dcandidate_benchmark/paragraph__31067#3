The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere. It is a classical example of 'the well-made play'. It has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions.  In The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), Dame Edith Evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of Lady  Bracknell; The Importance of Being Earnest (1992) by Kurt Baker used an all-black cast; and Oliver Parker's The Importance of Being Earnest (2002) incorporated some of Wilde's original material cut during the preparation of the original stage production.
