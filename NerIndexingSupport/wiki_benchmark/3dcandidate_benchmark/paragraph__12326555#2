Lutzerath lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. It is not, however, in the district bearing this same name. Lutzerath is found on a high ridge (435&nbsp;m above sea level) framed by dales, woods and meadows, between the state spa of Bad Bertrich and the tourist resort of Daun. Nearby are some crater lakes.
