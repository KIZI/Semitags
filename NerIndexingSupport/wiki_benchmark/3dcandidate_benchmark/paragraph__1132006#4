After many frustrating appearances for Manchester City, with few goals, he was sold to Championship team Southampton for £500,000 in the summer of 2006. The fee was partly funded by a prize from Coca-Cola won in a competition amongst fans. He made an immediate impact at Southampton, scoring on his debut against Derby County at Pride Park, and scoring an impressive goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 2–0 win at St. Mary's. He scored a total of 11 goals in the 2006–07 season.
