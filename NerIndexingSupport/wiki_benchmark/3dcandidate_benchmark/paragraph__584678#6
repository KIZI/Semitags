Hunt's first foray into politics was an unsuccessful 1890 run for county recorder of Gila County.  This was followed by successful runs for the Territorial House of Representatives in 1892 and 1894.  During his first term as a Representative, Hunt sponsored legislation authorizing a US$5,000 reward for capture of the Apache Kid.Wagoner p. 303
