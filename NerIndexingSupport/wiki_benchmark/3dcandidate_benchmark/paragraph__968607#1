\n\nA breather switch, expansion joint or adjustment switch is an intentional gap in railway tracks to allow for expansion in long sections of otherwise unbroken rail. They are placed between very long sections of continuous welded rail (CWR) or at the transition between CWR and jointed track, and commonly in the vicinity of bridges and aqueducts where the infrastructure and track may expand at different rates.
