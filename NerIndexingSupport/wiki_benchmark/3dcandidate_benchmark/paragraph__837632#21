From 1977, Petit started to build an atypical cosmological model, nowadays called the bigravity theory but formerly known as the twin universe theory, completed over the years. This model proposes a radically different vision for the universe, in opposition with the standard cosmology, but shares similarities with a model published before by Andrei Sakharov. \nIn the bi-gravity theory, there is not only one universe, but two parallel universes with two conjugated Riemannian metrics having their own geodesics, interacting through gravitation. Whereas Petit claims his theory explains various observational facts that the standard model cannot answer, and despite several publications through peer review, this model has not triggered much interest in the cosmological community throughout the years. However, in August 2007 Petit incorporated an international club of high-level geometers who take interest in his model and validate his work from its mathematical ground.The CITV (Colloque International sur les Techniques Variationnelles, in English International Meeting on Variational Techniques) is the annual international meeting of a selective restricted group originally created by Jean-Marie Souriau in 1950, made of specialized mathematicians and geometers working in the field of mathematical physics through functional analysis, strongly linking theories and observations with falsifiability.
