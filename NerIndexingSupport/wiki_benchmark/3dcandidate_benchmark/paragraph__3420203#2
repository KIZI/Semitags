'Sneaks' is a well-known local venue for alternative culture and indie rock, attracting a diverse crowd of writers, artists, serious music fans, and contemporary hipsters. Sneaky Dee's was home to the long-running Wavelength Music Arts Projects on Sunday nights, and the popular monthly Trampoline Hall Lecture Series until October 2009 when both series moved to The Garrison.  Many well-known bands have played at the venue, including Kids on TV, The Dirty Projectors, Feist, The Barcelona Pavilion, Comeback Kid, Cancer Bats, The Flatliners, Gob, Nails, Living With Lions, Broken Social Scene and Republic of Safety. The restaurant was also featured in the graphic novel Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together, the fourth in Bryan Lee O'Malley's acclaimed Scott Pilgrim series. The restaurant's menu has a Tex-mex theme.
