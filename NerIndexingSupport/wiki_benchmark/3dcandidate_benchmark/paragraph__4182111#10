The son of Roland Robot (introduced in Pet Peeve) and Hannah Barbarian (introduced in Geis of the Gargoyle and featured in Pet Peeve), Cyrus is introduced in Two to the Fifth as the lead character. Initially intending to ask the Good Magician if there was a suitable woman for him and where he might find her, he accidentally asked what his true desire was, and learned it was to become a playwright and direct his plays, forming a troupe of actors to perform them. Over the course of his adventure, he learned his talent (to change one small thing in any person's memory), and fell in love with the twelve-year-old Princess Rhythm (who temporarily aged herself to 22), resulting in the arrival of their daughter Kadence, allowing her to play a vital role in the defeat of Ragna Roc. After Cyrus and the others caused Ragna Roc to be defeated, Kadence returned to her rightful place in the future, while Cyrus was banished to Counter Xanth until Rhythm came of age six years later so that people would not get suspicious about their relationship.
