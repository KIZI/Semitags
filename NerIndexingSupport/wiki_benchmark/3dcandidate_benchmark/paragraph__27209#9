\nNear the end of the century, the French Revolution occurred.  A revolutionary tribunal was sent to Saint Lucia, headed by captain La Crosse.  However, prior to this, the slaves had simply walked off their jobs in 1790-1 to work for themselves.  Bringing the ideas of the revolution to Saint Lucia, La Crosse set up a guillotine used to execute Royalists.  In 1794, the French governor of the island declared that all slaves were free.
