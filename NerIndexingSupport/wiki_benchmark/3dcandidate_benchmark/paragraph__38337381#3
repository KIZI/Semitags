The Liberals first choice for the seat was Dr Edward Parrott. Parrott, a publisher and author,  was chairman of the Edinburgh South Liberal Association and also of the Edinburgh United Liberal Committee. Who was Who; OUP online, 2007 At a meeting on 11 April, the local executive of the Liberal Association met to consider who the candidate should be, assuming Dewar was to be appointed to the College of Justice. Parrott asked for 48 hours to think the offer over The Times, 12 April 1910 p12 but turned it down and the committee instead turned to Charles Lyell a 34 year old professional politician, as their preferred candidate. The Times, 19 April 1910 p10 Lyell had been MP for East Dorset from 1904 till January 1910. During that time he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary. He switched seats in January 1910, leaving the marginal East Dorset to Freddie Guest (Guest had family connections in the county) and taking on instead the usually Unionist seat of Edinburgh West, which he failed to gain.
