\nFrom 1973 to 1991 Ford Motor Argentina developed and sold a utility version of its own Ford Falcon called the Ford Ranchero. The first generation sold very well, and in 1974 exports began to Cuba. Later that year it became the best selling car in Argentina, with a total of 110,382 sold between 1973 and 1978. Production of the second generation model lasted from 1978 to 1982, and production of the third generation lasted from 1982 to 1987. In 1987 the fourth and final generation was released and in 1988 a diesel model was added to the lineup for the first time, however it was discontinued as of 1989. Production of the fourth generation Argentine Ranchero ended in 1991.
