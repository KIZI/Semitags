The process involved oxidation of cyclohexane with air in a series of six reactors to produce a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. Two months prior to the explosion, a crack was discovered in the number 5 reactor.  It was decided to install a temporary 50&nbsp;cm (20&nbsp;inch) diameter pipe to bypass the leaking reactor to allow continued operation of the plant while repairs were made.
