Cükätaw (pronounced ; Tatar Cyrillic: Җүкәтау) or Juketau (called Zhukotin in Russian chronicles) was a medieval Bolgar city during the 10th to 15th centuries CE. The city was situated on the right bank of Kama, near the modern city of Çístay (Chistopol). In the 10th to 13th centuries it was one of the most important furniture trade centres of Volga Bulgaria.  The city was the capital of Cükätaw Duchy. In 1236 Cükätaw was ruined Batu Khan's troops during the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria. Following the Russian pirate raids in the 14th and 15th centuries, the city's power declined. After the town was sacked by Yuri of Zvenigorod in 1414, it was abandoned. The ruins are situated near the modern village of Danaurovka.
