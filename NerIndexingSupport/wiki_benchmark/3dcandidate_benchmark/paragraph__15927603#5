Lee Adama leaves Galactica to start his new political career, but not before telling Starbuck that he believes her. The four Cylons (Colonel Tigh, Tory Foster, Samuel Anders, and Galen Tyrol) meet in secret to discuss who they think is the fifth Cylon. Since they believe Gaius Baltar may know, Tory visits him. At first, Baltar believes she is spying on him. After having a vision of his virtual self, he and Tory talk, and later sleep together. Afterward Tory says that she could be a Cylon, but Baltar tells her not to be afraid and that he has learned from his time among them that Cylons have feelings. He says that humans may have created the Cylons, but it was the one true God that gave them souls. Adama and Roslin discuss what to do with Starbuck. Though Roslin has objections, Adama eventually decides to let Starbuck go. In the end, she is taken to a hangar, where to her surprise, she is given a ship, the Demetrius and a team including Helo, Athena, Anders and Gaeta to find Earth.
