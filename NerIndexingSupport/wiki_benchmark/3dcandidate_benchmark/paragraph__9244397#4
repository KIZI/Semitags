Constantine married Giorgia, probably of the Lacon family. He had a daughter named Elena who died before 1089 and another named Vera who was alive in 1124. He had four sons, including Marianus II, and Orzocco (died after 1163), Itocorre (died 1112), and Sergius (died circa 1141). Constantine last appears in 1090, but a successor does not appear until 1103. His successor was his brother Torbeno, who may have been associated with him before.
