Within the forest there are a number of very large and old Yellowwoods of about the same age and size, surviving simultaneously because they were too small to harvest for logging during the late 19th century. On the upper contour of the walk you will also be enchanted by the very ancient vines that twine and spread through the tree canopies for miles on end.
