Kiesenebner was born in Linz, started his career with hometown FC Linz then played with LASK Linz when the two Linz sides merged under the LASK name. He moved to Austria Wien when LASK Linz were relegated in 2001 but struggled to establish himself. In 2002-03 he returned to Upper Austria with surprise 1st League champions SV Pasching and in his two seasons at the Waldstadion he helped Pasching qualify for the UEFA Cup for the first time. This prompted renewed interest from Austria Wien, who bought him for a second time in 2004.
