A power struggle between Michael Spillane and Coonan lasted from 1966 until 1977. In the 1970s, with Spillane's organization weakened by years of warfare with Coonan, a war started between Spillane and the Genovese crime family over control of a construction site in Hell's Kitchen. The Genoveses killed Spillane's top three lieutenants in 1976. This prompted Coonan to form an alliance with Roy DeMeo of the Gambino crime family. The Genoveses decided that the Westies were too violent and well led to go to war with and mediated a truce via the Gambinos.
