Renié was critical in promoting the double-action harp of Sebastian Erard, and inspired the creation of the chromatic harp through an offhand complaint about pedals to Gustave Lyon, who worked for a manufacturer of musical instruments, including harps.  Ironically, Renié demonstrated the rival Erard harp at the Brussels World's Fair, and was the major cause of its demise.
