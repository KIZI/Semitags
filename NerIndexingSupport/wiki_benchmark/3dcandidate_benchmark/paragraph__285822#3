Desaparecidos broke up in 2002 while the band was attracting an increasingly large following, especially touring with Jimmy Eat World and The Promise Ring and being the feature of an MTV You Hear it First episode.  However, Oberst did not have the time to dedicate to the band with the continually increasing success of Bright Eyes. Oberst continued to record with Bright Eyes, while the other members of Desaparecidos went on to form other projects. Matt Baum was in The '89 Cubs, but currently drums for Race for Titles and the Coffin Killers; Ian McElroy is Rig 1;  Denver Dalley is in Statistics and Intramural; Landon Hedges is currently in Little Brazil; and Casey Scott is Goldensection.
