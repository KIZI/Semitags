\nIn Cantabrian mythology, a ramidreju is a creature said to inhabit the mountains and forests of Cantabria, in northern Spain. This animal, which resembles a weasel, is born once every hundred years from a weasel or a marten. These mythological creatures has a very long body, like a snake, and their fur is slightly green-colored. Its eyes are yellow and its nose is like that of a hog, which it uses to dig very deep holes. Ramidrejus are a very sought-after animal in Cantabrian folklore because their fur heals every sickness and the animal has a strong desire for gold.
