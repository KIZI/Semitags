HMCS Algonquin was a V-Class World War II destroyer, laid down for the Royal Navy as HMS Valentine (R17) and transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy on completion.  One of her first assignments was to the British Home Fleet's 26th destroyer Flotilla.  While part of this group, near the end of March, 1944 she escorted a carrier strike on the Tirpitz (Operation Tungsten), and in April escorted an strike force seeking German shipping in the Lofoten Islands in Norway.  She was released from her Scapa Flow base in May for Operation Neptune and in June she was one of the warships providing naval gunfire support to the D-Day landings on Juno Beach. One month later After Neptune's conclusion she was returned to Scapa Flow and resumed operations hunting German warships and shipping.  In August she assisted the torpedoed HMS Nabob, recovering over 200 of Nabob's crew in that emergency.  Near the end of 1944 she escorted convoys JW.63 and RA.63 to and from Murmansk in the Soviet Union.  In February of 1945, Algonquin finally arrived in Canada for a tropicalization refit in Halifax.  Departing in August to joint the British Pacific Fleet's offensives against the Japanese, she was still in the eastern Mediterranean Sea on VJ-Day.  Following a brief stop in Alexandria, Egypt, she proceeded to cross the Indian and Pacific Oceans to her new base in HMCS Esquimault.  There, she was placed into reserve, unused for several years.
