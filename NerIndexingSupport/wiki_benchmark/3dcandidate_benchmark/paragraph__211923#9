About 5% of the population have Gilbert's disease, a mutation (or variation) in the UDP-glucuronyl-transferase promotor that manifests itself as jaundice when the individual is stressed (ie starves).  Autosomal recessive knockouts of UDP-glucuronyl-transferase itself can lead to Crigler-Najjar Syndrome and elevations of unconjugated bilirubin.  Defects in CMOAT (MRP2) results in Dubin-Johnson Syndrome and elevations of conjugated bilirubin.
