Lake Micmac is named after the Mi'kmaq Nation who used the Shubenacadie portage route as a transportation corridor before the arrival of European settlers.  Several pre-colonial archaeological sites have been found in the area of Shubie Park; many of the artifacts that were recovered are on display at the park's Fairbanks Centre.
