Matta's 2006–07 Ohio State team entered the season with the second rated recruiting class in the nation, headed by Greg Oden and Mike Conley, Jr., and ranked No. 4 in the preseason polls.  Ohio State would enter conference play with an 11–2 record, with their only defeats coming at the hand of the No. 6 ranked North Carolina Tar Heels and the No. 4 ranked Florida Gator, with both games on the road.  Ohio State's loss against No. 4 Wisconsin on January 9 would be their last loss of the regular season, with Ohio State winning 14 straight games and ending the season with a 27–3 record.  Ohio State was able to defeat No. 20 Tennessee and No. 2 Wisconsin during this winning streak and end the season as the top-ranked team in the nation.  Ohio State would win the Big Ten tournament, defeating Wisconsin 66–49 in the championship game, and enter the NCAA tournament as the overall No. 1 seed.  Ohio State would advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time under Matta after an overtime victory against Xavier, who Matta had previously coached.  A one point victory over Tennessee and a 92–76 victory over No. 2 Memphis would advance the Buckeyes to the Final Four.  Ohio State defeated Georgetown 67–60 in the national semifinal game, but would lose to the Florida Gators 84–75 in the national championship game.  Both Oden and Conley would enter the NBA draft following the season, with Oden being drafted number one overall and Conley going fourth overall.
