League shinty was originally organised on a regional basis, with distinct competitions for the North District and at one time, two separate leagues for Argyll (the Dunn League) and the Southern League, for clubs in Glasgow and Edinburgh and the surroudning areas.  There has over time been moves to amalgamate leagues and since the 1980s a push for national competition at the highest levels. In the modern era of league shinty, Kingussie have been unsurpassed in their sheer domination of the sport. Indeed, according to the Guinness Book of Records 2005, Kingussie is world sport's most successful sporting team of all time,[1] winning 20 consecutive league championships and going 4 years without losing a single fixture in the early 1990s. This incredible, unmatched run of dominance was ended on 2 September by ancient rivals Newtonmore who defeated Oban Camanachd 2-0 to ensure that Kingussie could not catch the team at the top of the Premier Division.  However, Newtonmore were unable to usurp their neighbours as champions, as the first post-Kingussie champions were confirmed as Fort William who sealed the title on 30 September 2006 having won their games in hand over Newtonmore. Kingussie regained the title in 2007. Since 2010, Newtonmore has been the dominant league force.
