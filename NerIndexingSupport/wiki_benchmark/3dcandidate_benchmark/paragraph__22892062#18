Within this basin, a tropical cyclone is assigned a name when it is judged to have reached Cyclonic Storm intensity with winds of 65&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph). The names were selected by members of the ESCAP/WMO panel on Tropical Cyclones between 2000 and May 2004, before the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in New Delhi started to assign names in September 2004. There is no retirement of tropical cyclone names in this basin as the list of names is only scheduled to be used once before a new list of names is drawn up. Should a named tropical cyclone move into the basin, from the Western Pacific then it will retain its original name. Five tropical cyclones have been named Laila, Bandu, Phet, Giri, and Jal on reaching Cyclonic Storm status by the IMD.
