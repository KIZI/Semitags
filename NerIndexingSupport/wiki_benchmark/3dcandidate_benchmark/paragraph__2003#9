The argument from moral normativity challenges the biological and sociological account of the development of human morality. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entail that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. There is a non sequitur when postulating a supernatural being with morality. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Human beings, as well as many other primates and organisms in existence today, have an understanding of why they behave morally without attributing any of it to an unsubstantiated supernatural claim. Morality is innate and natural and does not require a deity as an explanation. Unless there is a case of mental illness or a religious influence instructing an immoral act, an otherwise moral human being will have no justification to do something which is considered immoral. Morality is objective. However, it may be more logical to think of it as an evolutionary need to do good rather than holding a deity entirely responsible. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.Craig & Moreland 2011, p. 393
