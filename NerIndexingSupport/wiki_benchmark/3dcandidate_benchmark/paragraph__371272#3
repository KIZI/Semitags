They are small hemimetabolic insects with a distinctive cigar-shaped bauplan, elongated with transversely constricted bodies. They range in size from  in length for the larger predatory thrips, but most thrips are about 1 mm in length. Flight-capable thrips have two similar, strap-like, pairs of wings with a ciliated fringe, from which the order derives its name. Their legs usually end in two tarsal segments with a bladder-like structure known as an arolium at the pretarsus. This structure can be everted by means of hemolymph pressure, enabling the insect to walk on vertical surfaces.Gillott, Cedric (2005). Entomology. Springer. p. 234.
