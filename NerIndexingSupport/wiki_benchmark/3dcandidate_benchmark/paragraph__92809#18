Of these six sons, William Colbert served with General Andrew Jackson during the Creek Wars of 1813-14.  His brothers Levi and George Colbert also had military service in support of the United States.  In addition, the two each served as interpreters and negotiators for chiefs of the tribe during the period of removal.  Levi Colbert served as principal chief, which may have been a designation by the Americans, who did not understand the decentralized nature of the chiefs' council, based on the tribe reaching broad consensus for major decisions.  An example is that more than 40 chiefs from the Chickasaw Council, representing clans and villages, signed a letter in November 1832 by Levi Colbert to President Andrew Jackson, complaining about treaty negotiations with his appointee General John Coffee.\Levi Colbert to President Andrew Jackson
