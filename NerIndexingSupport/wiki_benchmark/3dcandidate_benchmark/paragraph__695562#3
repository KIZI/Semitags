The following season, Sol White signed him for the X Giants' arch rivals, the Philadelphia Giants, and moved him to shortstop, where he would remain through the bulk of his career.  In 1910, Lloyd accepted Rube Foster's invitation to join the Chicago Leland Giants, where he anchored a team that Foster described as the greatest of all time.  He rejoined White on the newly-organized Lincoln Giants in 1911, batting .475 against all competition.
