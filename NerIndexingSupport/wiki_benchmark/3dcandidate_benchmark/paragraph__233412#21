Barrymore has never regained his former star status, having not had a television vehicle for over a decade, and planned stage comebacks, such as a 2011 tour, have been announced but then, subsequently, cancelled. Although Strike It Rich and Strike It Lucky have been repeated on the digital channel Challenge, his entertainment shows such as Barrymore and My Kind of People are never repeated anywhere and his work is never included on clip shows, such as those marking ITV's 50th anniversary or the 100th anniversary of the London Palladium. The only appearances that he has made in the last 10 years has been on reality shows or interview shows. His only work in 2012 was on local radio stations, and on hospital radio. One was on Minster FM, on Greg Scott's breakfast show on 25 February 2012, where he was surprised to meet one of his all-time favourite television guests, Fiona Iverson, who had appeared on his show twenty years earlier.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfTWqdKrb4c
