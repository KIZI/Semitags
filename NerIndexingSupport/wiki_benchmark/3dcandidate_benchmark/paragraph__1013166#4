Built on a former landfill, construction for Dr. Michael M. Krop High School began in 1996 after the Miami-Dade School Board approved plans to build a new high school in North Miami-Dade County to lessen overcrowding in local elementary and secondary schools, including North Miami Beach High School. Opening its doors in 1998, Krop began with 9th and 10th grades and eventually added 11th and 12th grades; its first graduating class was the class of 2001. At the time of its opening, Krop had a total enrollment of 1,475 students.
