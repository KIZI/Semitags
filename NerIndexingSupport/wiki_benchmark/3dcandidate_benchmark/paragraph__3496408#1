State Route 515 (SR&nbsp;515) is a four-lane C-shaped state highway in the northern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It begins just west of Nelson. It curves to the northeast to Lake Chatuge, where it heads north to the North Carolina state line. The route was built to give motorists in the north Georgia mountains better access to Atlanta and its outlying suburbs, as opposed to the old SR&nbsp;5 and U.S. Route 76 (US&nbsp;76) routes, which this project replaced. SR&nbsp;515 is also known as the Zell Miller Mountain Parkway, in honor of the Young Harris native turned Georgia governor and U.S. senator. It is one of the Georgia Department of Transportation's GRIP corridors. The highway is known for its fantastic mountain views all along its route. SR&nbsp;515 is part of the Appalachian Development Highway System's Corridor A.
