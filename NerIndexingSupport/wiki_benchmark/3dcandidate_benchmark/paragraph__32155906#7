The first season is considered as the origin of the majority of gags, gestures and personalities of the characters. Due to years, many episodes were missing, the episodes are Sketches from the Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada which ran from 1968 until 1973, a show similar to the Saturday Night Live. Like SNL, the Supergenios shows consisted of various sketches of characters created by Chespirito, El Chavo was created in 1972. The sketches of El Chavo are compiled with sketches of the other characters (Doctor Chapat√≠n, Los Caquitos and Chespirito), they were complied in early 1973 (just few episodes after the start of the 30-minute El Chavo sticom) because of an accident of Chespirito that keep him away from the filming of new episodes for the El Chavo series for some days.
