If the three given circles are mutually tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself and to the other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure&nbsp;12) correspond to the inscribed and circumscribed circles, and are called Soddy's circles.\n The three given circles of this Apollonius problem form a Steiner chain tangent to the two Soddy's circles.
