\nOn 17 February 1818, workmen breaking ground on the new parish church to be built on the site of the eastern choir of Dunfermline Abbey uncovered a vault before the site of the former abbey high altar.Penman 2009 p.14Jardine 1821 p.2 The vault was covered by two large, flat stones – one forming a headstone, and a larger stone six feet (182&nbsp;cm) in length, with six iron rings or handles set in it. When these stones were removed, the vault was found to be seven feet (214&nbsp;cm) in length, 56&nbsp;cm wide and 45&nbsp;cm deep.Jardine 1821 p.6 Within the vault, inside the remnants of a decayed oak coffin, there was a body entirely enclosed in lead, with a decayed shroud of cloth of gold over it. Over the head of the body the lead was formed into the shape of a crown.Jardine 1821 p.4 Fragments of marble and alabaster had been found in the debris around the site of vault several years earlier, which were linked to Robert the Bruce’s recorded purchase of a marble and alabaster tomb made in Paris.Jardine 1821 p.13 The Barons of Exchequer ordered that the vault was to be secured from all further inspection with new stones and iron bars and guarded by the town constables, and that once the walls of the new church were built up around the site, an investigation of the vault and the remains could take place.Jardine 1821 p.5\nAccordingly, on 5 November 1819, the investigation took place. The cloth of gold shroud and the lead covering were found to be in a rapid state of decay since the vault had first been opened 21 months earlier.Jardine 1821 p.6 The body was raised up and placed on a wooden coffin board on the edge of the vault. It was found to be covered in two thin layers of lead, each around 5&nbsp;mm thick. The lead was removed and the skeleton was inspected by James Gregory and Alexander Monro, Professor of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. The sternum was found to have been sawn open from top to bottom, permitting removal of the king’s heart after death.Jardine 1821 p.8  A plaster cast was taken of the detached skull by artist William Scoular.Jardine 1821 p.8Fawcett 2005 p.100  The bones were measured and drawn, and the king’s skeleton was measured to be 5 feet 11 inches (180&nbsp;cm). It has been estimated that Bruce may have stood at around 6 feet 1 inch (186&nbsp;cm) tall as a young man, which by medieval standards was impressive. At this height he would have stood almost as tall as Edward I ( 6 feet 2 inches; 188&nbsp;cm).Jardine 1821 p.8
