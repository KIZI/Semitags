Since the beginning of the '90s, Daisley has contributed to a wealth of recordings as bassist, lyricist and producer, including albums by Yngwie Malmsteen, Takara, Bill Ward and Jeff Watson of Night Ranger. Shortly after, Daisley and Watson teamed up once again and formed Mother's Army along with vocalist Joe Lynn Turner and drummer Carmine Appice. In 2003, following his second and unsuccessful suit against Ozzy Osbourne, he teamed up with Lee Kerslake, Steve Morse of Deep Purple and Australian rock singer Jimmy Barnes to record an album under the name Living Loud. Six of the album's eleven tracks were covers from Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. Don Airey also played keyboards on the Living Loud album. On 7 February 2003 Daisley recorded a live show at The Basement in Sydney with Australian blues band The Hoochie Coochie Men, for a live DVD and CD release. Also featured were former Deep Purple organist Jon Lord and Jimmy Barnes. In 2007 The Hoochie Coochie Men released the studio album 'Danger: White Men Dancing' also featuring Jon Lord.
