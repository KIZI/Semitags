The Queen's body was first taken to Lincoln for embalming at St. Catherine's Priory. The viscera was buried in a tomb at Lincoln Cathedral and her heart was buried at Blackfriars Church in London. Her body was taken to Westminster Abbey for burial in a tomb. King Edward later declared that to honour Eleanor, a memorial would be erected wherever the Queen's body had rested on its journey home to Westminster. Crosses of this nature were erected in the hope that pilgrims and those passing by would pray for the soul of the Queen.\nThe first of the Eleanor crosses was erected on Swine's Green, opposite the gates of St Catherine's. Of the 12 crosses erected only three now remain standing. In the grounds of Lincoln Castle there is a small piece of the St. Catherine's cross, that was originally in the Priory grounds.
