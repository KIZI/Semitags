Hostilities broke out on June 14 as the Austro-Prussian War (June–August 1866), in which Prussia and the north German states faced not only Austria but much of the rest of Germany, especially the southern states. Three days later Italy declared was on Austria in the Third Italian War of Independence, Italy now being Prussia's ally. Thus Austria had to fight on two fronts. Their first engagement resulted in a minor victory against the Italians at Custoza near Verona on June 24. However on the northern front Austria suffered a major military defeat at the Battle of Königgrätz in Bohemia on July 3. Although Austria had a further victory against the Italians in a naval battle at Lissa on July 20, it was clear by then that the war was over for Austria, Prussian armies threatening Vienna itself, forcing the evacuation of the court to Budapest. Napoleon III intervened resulting in an armistice at Nikolsburg on July 21 and a peace treaty in Prague on August 23. In the meantime the Italians who had had a series of successes throughout July, and signed an armistice at Cormons on August 12 rather than face the remaining Austrian army freed from its northern front.
