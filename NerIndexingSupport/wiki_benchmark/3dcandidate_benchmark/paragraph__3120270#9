Pipes made his only Marvel appearance in issue #245 of the Marvel UK Transformers comic, as an Autobot cadet. After his fellow cadets Tailgate, Flattop and Subsea entered the disused sewers of Cybertron (known as the Underworld) as part of an outdated Autobot initiation, they were attacked by mutant Transformers, and Subsea and Flattop were killed. Pipes and Outback (also a cadet), arrived to rescue their friends just in time to see Tailgate destroy the mutants, and the three of them escaped the sewers together, with Pipes warning that they were lucky not to have encountered anything worse. However, unbeknown to them, Tailgate's battle had awakened horrific demons beneath Cybertron, who would emerge to battle other Autobots and Decepticons in the next two issues.
