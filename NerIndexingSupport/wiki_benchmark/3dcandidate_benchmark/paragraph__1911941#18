Ralph (Perry Benson) Fireman and Trainee Driver - Works with Arnold - the two often engage in comic banter. Ralph is as daft as Wilfred, and slow at learning to drive - but he drives the train perfectly in the final episode.  Like Arnold, he is a minor character, but one episode centres around him - in Episode 14 he threatens to go on strike.
