A strawman sockpuppet is a false flag pseudonym created to make a particular point of view look foolish or unwholesome in order to generate negative sentiment against it. Strawman sockpuppets typically behave in an unintelligent, uninformed, or bigoted manner and advance \straw man\" arguments that their puppeteers can easily refute. The intended effect is to discredit more rational arguments made for the same position.Thomler
