Dennis L. White of Columbus, Ohio, was the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, 2002&ndash;2005. He was chairman of the Ohio delegation to the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, where he urged members of his delegation not to cross picket lines in the event of a labor dispute between Boston's Mayor and its police union.  This led several delegates to complain that they were being \forced to take a side without knowing all the facts\".[1]"
