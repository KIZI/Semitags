USS Nimitz (CVN-68) is a supercarrier of the United States Navy, and is the lead ship of its class. It is one of the largest warships in the world. It was laid down, launched and commissioned as CVAN-68 but was redesignated CVN 68 (nuclear-powered multimission aircraft carrier) on 30 June 1975 as part of the fleet realignment of that year.
