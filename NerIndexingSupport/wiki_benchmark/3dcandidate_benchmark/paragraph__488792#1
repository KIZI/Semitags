CIDC-FM (Z103.5) is a Rhythmic-Leaning CHR radio station that serves Central Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area in Canada. Although the station is licensed to Orangeville, and still has a transmitter there, its studios are located in Toronto. The station is owned by Evanov Communications. It fills the market's Top 40 niche and includes a certain degree of dance music in its playlists, similar to CKMF-FM in Montreal. During good DXing times, CIDC's signal can be interfered from WRTS-FM (on 103.7&nbsp;MHz) in Erie, Pennsylvania. CIDC has also been voted as the CHR station of the year for Canada at the Canadian Music and Broadcast Industry Awards.[1] In addition to targeting Toronto, the station also reaches its strong signal into Barrie and Kitchener.  It is also the longest-running FM top 40 station in Toronto, starting as a dance station in 1995, and then later as a top 40/dance hybrid since 1998, and finally to its current fulltime top 40 status in 2009.
