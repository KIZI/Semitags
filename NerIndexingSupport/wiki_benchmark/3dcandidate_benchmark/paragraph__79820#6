PSV garnered many honours in the football arena and have been credited as the club where many successful players such as Ruud Gullit, Hans van Breukelen, Gerald Vanenburg, Romário, Eric Gerets, Ronald Koeman, Ronaldo, Luc Nilis, Wim Kieft, Jaap Stam, Boudewijn Zenden, Arthur Numan, Wim Jonk, Danko Lazović, Balázs Dzsudzsák, Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, Phillip Cocu, Ibrahim Afellay, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Park Ji-Sung, Jefferson Farfán, Heurelho Gomes, Alex, Eiður Guðjohnsen, Mateja Kežman, and Arjen Robben made their name. Their success was built on the foundations laid down by other famous players like Coen Dillen, Willy van der Kuijlen, Jan van Beveren, Jan Poortvliet, and the Van de Kerkhof brothers, Willy and René.\nPSV has difficulty competing with the salaries that are being paid elsewhere. It has managed though to become a springboard for professional development for some of these talents.
