Lauren was born in Cameroon as his parents fled Equatorial Guinea, due to the political persecution during the dictatorship of Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema. Then the family moved to Seville, where he was raised. He started his career in Spain, playing for Utrera, (on loan from Sevilla), San Fernando, Sevilla, Levante, and Mallorca. He qualified for dual nationality through residency and as a Spaniard, he is exempt from the post-Bosman ruling regulation that restricts the number of non-EU players to three per team in UEFA competition matches even though he is a Cameroonian international.
