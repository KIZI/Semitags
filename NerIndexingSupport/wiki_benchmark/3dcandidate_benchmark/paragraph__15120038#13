November started with an away game at Goodison Park against Everton. An early Yakubu goal was cancelled out in the 80th minute by Olivier Kapo, only for two injury time goals from Lee Carsley and James Vaughan saw Everton snatch all three points. Next up was the Second City derby against Aston Villa at St Andrew's. An early Liam Ridgewell own goal gave the Villa a first half lead. Mikael Forssell tied the game early in the second half however, but it was not to be as Gabriel Agbonlahor gave the Villa all three points. The Villa game was to be the last game in charge of the Blues for Steve Bruce, who left the club to join Wigan Athletic on 20 November 2007. McLeish had quit Scotland the day before to take over at the midlands club, and brought his two Scottish assistants, Andy Watson and former Villa caretaker manager Roy Aitken.
