Throughout 2001 Knight returned to the recording studio to write and record her third studio album. She was accompanied by a different array of writers and producers handpicked largely by Kevin and Bev from Britain and the United States, which included James Poyser, Che Guevara, Derrick Joshua & Derrick Martin, D'Influence, Mike Spencer and Colin Emmanuel. The result was Who I Am, which was released in March 2002. It was preceded by two singles, \Get Up!\" and \"Shoulda Woulda Coulda\" which was a first in that it introduced Knight to the world of Nashville and one of its most famous son's Craig Wiseman a giant in the country music business. This partnership became Knight's most successful single up to that point
