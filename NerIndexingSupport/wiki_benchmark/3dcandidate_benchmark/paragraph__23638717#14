Homo erectus fossils include specimen BOU-VP-2/66, the Daka skull, an incomplete skull that had an endocranial capacity of 995&nbsp;cm3.   These fossils of H. erectus are important since it has been suggested that Asian and African H, erectus were different human species. But these fossils do not support “the hypothesis of a deep cladogenesis between African and Asian H. erectus” and that “that geographic subdivision of early H. erectus into separate species lineages is biologically misleading, artificially inflating early Pleistocene species diversity.”   Moreover, they suggest that the H. erectus taxon had “by 1 Myr the taxon had colonized much of the Old World without speciating. A finding of\nconsiderable biogeographic and behavioural significance”.
