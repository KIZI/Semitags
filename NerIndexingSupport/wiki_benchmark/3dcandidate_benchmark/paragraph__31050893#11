IntegraBase is being tested by Caltrans in their quest to construct higher quality and longer lasting roads. Resperion and Caltrans have been working together for numerous years in an attempt to refine the technical guidance and specifications written for higher strength asphalt concrete base in order to allow its routine use cost effectively on California State Highway projects. Caltrans utilized IntegraBase in the basecourse in a section of State Route 138 near Palmdale, CA in 2006/2007.
