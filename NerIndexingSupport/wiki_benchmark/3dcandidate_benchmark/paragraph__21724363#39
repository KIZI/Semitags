In 1909, a Road Board was set up to improve roads. It was initially funded by a tax on motor fuel and a later a licence duty on cars, the Road Fund. Road surfaces were improved and roads were widened and straightened using money raised by the Road Fund. The Road Board was abolished in 1919 when its functions were transferred to the newly established Ministry of Transport. In 1922, after the foundation of the Irish Free State, the Minister for Local Government took over the functions of the Ministry of Transport. In 2002, the newly renamed Department of Transport took over responsibility for national roads.http://books.google.ie/books?id=P6OdT7MIflgC&pg=PA193&lpg=PA193&dq=Ireland+post+roads&source=bl&ots=x1JhYRckLI&sig=6GRZGtqalyW0EuxE0ZBbf0HWroQ&hl=en&ei=5CmrSdyhOtSyjAeg6PDiDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA193,M1 Howell, 193 From 1921-1922 onwards, the partition of Ireland has led to different paths in the evolution of public road networks in Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland. Responsibility for roads in Northern Ireland fell on the Stormont administration from 1921 to 1972. In 1996, the Northern Ireland Roads Service was set up; it became an agency of the Northern Ireland Department for Regional Development when devolved government was restored in 1999.[15] Roads Service: About Us
