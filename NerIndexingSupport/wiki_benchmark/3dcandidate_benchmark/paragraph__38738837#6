Linda Christensen is among many artists who work with butter in the United States. Butter art originally started when the ancient Tibetan monks first carved animals and deities out of yak butter. It journeyed its way to North America in the early 1800's where butter sculptures became a tradition displayed at state fairs. The first butter cow was created in 1910 at the Iowa State Fair. About 600 pounds of pure butter is used for each butter cow. Many famous characters and symbols have been immortalized in butter including Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang, the Last Supper, Elvis Presley, John Wayne, Harley Davis motorcycles, Darth Vader and astronauts, John Glenn and Neil Armstrong.
