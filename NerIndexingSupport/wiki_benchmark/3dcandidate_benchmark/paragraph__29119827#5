In the fall on 1980 a group of friends hiking along Oak Creek were informed by an Eckankar representative that they were trespassing on private property.  The group happened to include Bruce Babbitt, then-governor of Arizona.  Concerned about loss of public access along waterways, Babbitt researched the property and noted its potential for a full-fledged state park.  After determining the willingness of all parties involved, Babbitt pursued a three-way land exchange: Eckankar would sell  of Arizona State Land Department property they had been leasing in Pima County.  Since state law only provided for such exchanges within a county, the Arizona Legislature had to pass new legislation allowing trans-county trades.  The enabling law and the transfers were completed in 1981.
