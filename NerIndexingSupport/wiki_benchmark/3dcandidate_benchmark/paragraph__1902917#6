Two primary contemporary British sources exist: the Confessio of Saint Patrick and Gildas' De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain).Discussion in Ken Dark, Britain and the End of the Roman Empire, (Stroud: Tempus, 2000), pp.32-7 Patrick's Confessio and his Letter to Coroticus reveals aspects of life in Britain, from whence he was abducted to Ireland.  It is particularly useful in highlighting the state of Christianity at the time. Gildas is the nearest to a source of Sub-Roman history but there are many problems in using it. The document represents British history as he and his audience understood it. Though a few other documents of the period do exist, such as Gildas' letters on monasticism, they are not directly relevant to British history. Gildas' De Excidio is a jeremiad; it is written as a polemic to warn contemporary rulers against sin, demonstrating through historical and biblical examples that bad rulers are always punished by God â€” in the case of Britain, through the destructive wrath of the Saxon invaders.  The historical section of De Excidio is short, and the material in it is clearly selected with Gildas' purpose in mind.  There are no absolute dates given, and some of the details, such as those regarding the Hadrian and Antonine Walls are clearly wrong.  Nevertheless, Gildas does provide us with an insight into some of the kingdoms that existed when he was writing, and to how an educated monk perceived the situation that had developed between the Anglo-Saxons and the Britons.
